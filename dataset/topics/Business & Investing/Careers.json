Not doing so will ensure failure. At the turn of the 20th Century approximately one out of every three people on earth were of Caucasian or \"white\" ancestry. By the year 2000 that number stood at one out of seven. By the end of this century, demography experts predict that number to plunge to one out of twenty. Likewise in the United States, in 1900, approximately nine-tenths of the population was white. By 2000 that number had dropped to seven-tenths. Demographers project that number to be less than one half by 2053 and a little more than a third by the end of the century. The reason? If you were to ask the layman on the street he might respond \"It's because Africans, Asians, Indians or Middle Easterners are reproducing in large numbers.\" However, in actuality, the birth rates of these \"developing\" populations--though still at a high level--have themselves declined over 50 percent in recent years. The core reason for this disproportionate Caucasian decline is their own extraordinarily low birth rates--the subject of this book. From the days of early Rome, throughout the reign of the Titans, into the development of constitutional law and the cultural and technological breakthroughs of the 20th Century, indisputably, Caucasians have led the charge and reaped the concomitant high living standards, asset, status, and wealth benefits. This will begin to change by mid century. Many celebrated authors in the demographics field have written books on this birth decline phenomenon. Some of the more prominent include: Fewer: How the New Demography Will Shape Our Future, by Ben Wattenberg; The Empty Cradle: How Falling Birth Rates Threaten World Prosperity and What to Do About It, by Paul Longman; A Question of Numbers: High Migration, Low Fertility, and the Politics of National Identity by Jay Winters and Michael Teitlebaum; Global Aging and its Economic Consequences by Robert Lee. All of these books delineate clearly the problems associated with birth decline. All note the dramatic consequences particularly amongst Western societies. This book, however, stands alone in giving the philosophical/ideological underlying causes (The 7 basic principles) for these dramatic changes in birth rates since the mid '60s in the United States and the rest of the world. In addition, these publications miss the opportunity to prepare the reader to capitalize on the investment, business and employment effects of this phenomenon. It prepares the reader to adjust his thinking to an age of population decline before the effects leave him behind the curve of change.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781496915665"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1496915666"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W04cBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W04cBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W04cBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA145&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W04cBAAAQBAJ&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_Changing_World_Demographics_Affects.html?hl=&id=W04cBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_Changing_World_Demographics_Affects-sample-pdf.acsm?id=W04cBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=W04cBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Some had non-or-semi-skilled <b>jobs</b>. ...

Kolari"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2009-12-01", "description": "How can business leaders make better production and capital investment decisions? How can Wall Street analysts improve their predictions of future stock market values? How can government improve macroeconomic forecasts and policies? In The Power of Profit, Anari and Kolari demonstrate how profit measures can be applied as the basis for these and many other applications of economic, policy, financial, and business analysis. The underlying theme of the book is that profitability is the driving force in free market economies. Firms invest in capital, produce goods and services, and generate sales in an effort to reap profits. Firms that are unprofitable exit the marketplace and are replaced by profitable firms. Despite the crucial importance of profits, however, there is no formal model that directly relates profits to capital formation and output. Previous studies over the past 100 years on profit and the economy are mainly descriptive in nature, without any well-specified model grounded in microeconomic theory. Filling this gap, the authors present a profit system model of the firm grounded in basic accounting relationships in addition to the well-known Cobb-Douglas production function, which can be applied to individual firms, industries, and the business sector as a whole. Through rigorous data analysis, the authors show how the profit system modelcan be applied to: modeling the U.S. business sector and national economy forecasting output, capital stock, total profit, profit rates, and profit margins examining the relationships among profitability, economic growth, and the business cycle simulating the effects of potential monetary policy changes on the business sector and national economy valuing the Standard & Poor\u2019s stock market index as well as individual firms. The result is a model that integrates microeconomic and macroeconomic factors and that can be widely applied in business and economic decisions, policymaking, research, and teaching.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1441906495"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781441906496"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 180, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.8.11.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&pg=PA1&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&rdid=book-u3PnPKmiFsIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Power_of_Profit-sample-epub.acsm?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Power_of_Profit-sample-pdf.acsm?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=u3PnPKmiFsIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Chapter 1 The Role of Profit in Advanced Market Economies During our <b>careers</b> <br>\nas <b>business</b> economists before ... are key variables not only in <b>investment</b> <br>\ndecisions but also in production decisions after <b>investments</b> are made and goods <br>\nand&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9DAj3x4TwL0C", "etag": "gxW2SG8PItY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9DAj3x4TwL0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Investment Frontier", "subtitle": "New York Businessmen and the Economic Development of the Old Northwest", "authors": ["John D.

On the contrary, New York financiers and other eastern entrepreneurs were crucial to America's western economic development, providing the necessary capital and expertise to transform the West into a productive part of the nation's economy. This thesis is powerfully demonstrated by John Denis Haeger in this study concerning the \"Old Northwest\" (the present-day states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin) during the years 1815-1840. The result of years of research in manuscript collections and government documents, the book provides a comprehensive picture of early land speculators, examining their investments in farm lands, town lots, banks and transportation improvements, as well as their influence on western businessmen and institutions. It also explores their political and economic affairs on the East Coast, since these matters dramatically affected the scope of their western investments. Historians' generalizations about nonresident investors or eastern speculators have previously assumed a common type and business method when, in fact, easterners possessed varying economic goals and utilized different business strategies. To demonstrate this, Haeger compares and contrasts the promoter Charles Butler and the conservative speculators Isaac and Arthur Bronson, key figures among New York's financial elite, whose careers and strategies are for the first time described in detail. The activities of these investment pioneers, whose \"every move was calculated to return profits,\" challenge the traditional images of westward expansion as a largely unplanned and spontaneous movement of people and capital.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0873955307"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780873955300"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 311, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&pg=PA1&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Investment_Frontier.html?hl=&id=9DAj3x4TwL0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Investment_Frontier-sample-epub.acsm?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Investment_Frontier-sample-pdf.acsm?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The latter part of this chapter describes the early <b>career</b> of Arthur Bronson since <br>\nhe assumed the task of directing the family&#39;s <b>business</b> interests in the 1830s, <br>\nparticularly its <b>investments</b> in western lands.

Wealth is the world's most valuable guide to wealth management for individuals, families, business owners, and the \"upwardly affluent.\" In the six years since Stuart Lucas first wrote this book, however, the financial world has changed dramatically. Throughout the financial crisis and beyond, Lucas has led the University of Chicago's Private Wealth Management program, teaching more than 500 members of the world's wealthiest families. Now, he brings together extraordinary insights and constructs informed by this experience. Wealth, Updated and Revised Edition retains its core advice, which has been tested and proven by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. However, Lucas has updated his exclusive Strategic Wealth Management Framework to help even more individuals, families, and entrepreneurs aspiring to wealth or seeking to protect it. Lucas highlights key value drivers - family purpose, the economic engine, and leakage management - that mark the difference between family enterprises that succeed for generations and those that fail. He offers updated, sage advice on making financial decisions, evaluating \"expert\" advice, running a family business office, tax/estate planning, philanthropy, wealth preservation, and more. Since developing a family's human capital is the best antidote to Wall Street excess, this edition adds even more robust and actionable guidance for building a culture of Entrepreneurial Stewardship: one that enables and encourages all family members to flourish, and improves the odds that families can sustain wealth. This book is for all successful business owners and anyone who possesses (or aspires to own) substantial financial assets, whether earned or inherited. It will also be of keen interest to investment advisors, business consultants, business brokers, wealth industry practitioners, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, and others who counsel the wealthy (and upwardly affluent) about wealth management.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780133132830"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0133132838"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.8.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OeL7jqof5qUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OeL7jqof5qUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OeL7jqof5qUC&pg=PT159&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OeL7jqof5qUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OeL7jqof5qUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1418.94, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 709.47, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OeL7jqof5qUC&rdid=book-OeL7jqof5qUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1418940000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 709470000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OeL7jqof5qUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Plus continued <b>business</b> ownership can enhance the family&#39;s sense of purpose. <br>\nSome <b>careers</b> are risky and volatile and others are stable.

We may all define risk, and our tolerance for it, somewhat differently, but we might all agree it plays a pivotal role in guiding us toward an optimal outcome. As a long-time investment advisor, Firestone has grown accustomed to interpreting risk on a daily basis. She has developed four core tenets of risk-taking we can all apply to anticipating, evaluating, and responding to the risks we face in our business, investing, and personal lives. These tenets are right-sizing; right-timing; relying on skill, knowledge, and experience; and staying skeptical about numbers, promises, and forecasts. Firestone's approach is both practical and accessible to individuals who are making important decisions, such as embarking on new career or life changes, starting or running an enterprise, making a sizable investment, or deciding how to balance across a full portfolio of assets. The book is rich with anecdotes and examples of how many prominent leaders in their fields encountered and dealt with risk along the way. Firestone also shares her own successes and failures, in particular when she decided to risk it all--a fabulous career managing billions of dollars at a premium investment company, her reputation, and the security at home that comes with a strong and stable job--to go out on her own. Even the Odds helps us understand the broader implications of risk--and how it guides our decision-making--so that we can improve outcomes across multiple facets of our lives, from our businesses and investments, to the personal choices we make.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781351861861"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1351861867"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=45&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2801.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2801.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ptJCDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2801320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2801320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Even_the_Odds-sample-epub.acsm?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Even_the_Odds-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ptJCDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book is rich with anecdotes and examples of how many prominent leaders in their fields encountered and dealt with risk along the way."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "aTMUAQAAMAAJ", "etag": "BgRnkN33Sks", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/aTMUAQAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "New Account Careers", "publisher": "McGraw-Hill College", "publishedDate": "1989-09-01", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:35128001000510"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 160, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aTMUAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aTMUAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aTMUAQAAMAAJ&q=Careers+in+business+and+investments&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aTMUAQAAMAAJ&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/New_Account_Careers.html?hl=&id=aTMUAQAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aTMUAQAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Public accountants have their own <b>businesses</b> or work for accounting firms. ... <br>\nand auditors may also be affected by changes in legislation related to taxes, <br>\nfinancial reporting standards, <b>business investment</b>, and other financial matters."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "SQlW7TSONQcC", "etag": "7ScmWC9B5wU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/SQlW7TSONQcC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Small Town in Mass Society", "subtitle": "Class, Power, and Religion in a Rural Community", "authors": ["Arthur J.

More than just financial rewards are at stake. Friendships and relationships can suffer. Bad decisions at the inception of a promising venture lay the foundations for its eventual ruin. The Founder's Dilemmas is the first book to examine the early decisions by entrepreneurs that can make or break a startup and its team. Drawing on a decade of research, Noam Wasserman reveals the common pitfalls founders face and how to avoid them. He looks at whether it is a good idea to cofound with friends or relatives, how and when to split the equity within the founding team, and how to recognize when a successful founder-CEO should exit or be fired. Wasserman explains how to anticipate, avoid, or recover from disastrous mistakes that can splinter a founding team, strip founders of control, and leave founders without a financial payoff for their hard work and innovative ideas. He highlights the need at each step to strike a careful balance between controlling the startup and attracting the best resources to grow it, and demonstrates why the easy short-term choice is often the most perilous in the long term. The Founder's Dilemmas draws on the inside stories of founders like Evan Williams of Twitter and Tim Westergren of Pandora, while mining quantitative data on almost ten thousand founders.

Silberstein"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14", "description": "Dual-career marriage, in which wife and husband each pursue a professional career, offers a window into the changing landscape of gender roles and relations. In the span of a single generation, the family in which both parents work outside the home has gone from being the exception to being the rule. This book examines the multi-layered implications this impressive, rapid change holds for the fabric of family and marital life and for the course of men's and women's work lives. Intensive interviews with dual-career wives and husbands provide rich information about four major issues: * In what ways and for whom do dual-career marriages replicate the traditional gender arrangements of one-career marriages, and in what ways do dual-career marriages represent a revolution in gender roles? * How do the two careers of spouses develop side by side, and in what ways do dual-career spouses help or hinder each other's careers? * How do work and family combine in dual-career marriages? * How are relationships between spouses and between parents and children affected by dual careers? This book presents a subtle, textured portrait of contemporary dual-career marriage -- examining the complicated interplay of expectations, behaviors, and emotions within and between dual-career spouses. The author observes that the centrality of family or work to each spouse's sense of self powerfully affects how the couple negotiates the challenges posed by dual-career marriage, including feelings of competition between spouses, questions of geographic moves, and division of domestic tasks. The study illuminates many issues of clinical relevance, such as the common hazard of dual-career spouses having little time for marital intimacy once the rigorous demands of careers and children are met, and the complicated intrapersonal as well as interpersonal tensions generated by gender roles in transition.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781317783558"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1317783557"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT42&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=76&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3137.62, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3137.62, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ljuZAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3137620000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3137620000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dual_career_Marriage-sample-epub.acsm?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dual_career_Marriage-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ljuZAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Although both husbands and wives faced considerable challenge in accepting <br>\nher <b>career</b> as more salient or ...

A fascinating look inside a larger-than-life football family.\u201d \u2014Dan Shaughnessy, bestselling author of Francona: The Red Sox Years It is so statistically unlikely as to be almost unbelievable. Somehow, the Gronkowski family has produced three sons who play in the NFL (Rob, Chris, and Dan), one who was drafted into Major League Baseball (Gordie Jr.), and another who is the starting fullback for Kansas State (Goose). Their father, Gordy, even played college football for Syracuse. How did it happen? From an early age, Gordy realized the potential his sons had and worked with them to make the most of it. Beyond their monstrous size, physicality, and raw talent, he instilled in them a commitment to fitness, health, drive, and determination that would give his boys a leg up in ways other families simply couldn\u2019t match. And the boys\u2019 motivation certainly wasn\u2019t something solely triggered by a driven father. They were like a pack of adolescent wolves readying themselves for the recruiting hunt. Still, all were honor roll students; the three oldest earned college degrees. Each was motivated and inspired by his brothers.

Feeling unfulfilled, burned out, or just plain unhappy with what we\u2019re doing, we long to make that leap into the unknown. But we also hold on, white-knuckled, to the years of time and effort we\u2019ve invested in our current profession. In this powerful book, Herminia Ibarra presents a new model for career reinvention that flies in the face of everything we\u2019ve learned from \"career experts.\" While common wisdom holds that we must first know what we want to do before we can act, Ibarra argues that this advice is backward. Knowing, she says, is the result of doing and experimenting. Career transition is not a straight path toward some predetermined identity, but a crooked journey along which we try on a host of \"possible selves\" we might become. Based on her in-depth research on professionals and managers in transition, Ibarra outlines an active process of career reinvention that leverages three ways of \"working identity\": experimenting with new professional activities, interacting in new networks of people, and making sense of what is happening to us in light of emerging possibilities. Through engrossing stories\u2014from a literature professor turned stockbroker to an investment banker turned novelist\u2014Ibarra reveals a set of guidelines that all successful reinventions share. She explores specific ways that hopeful career changers of any background can: Explore possible selves Craft and execute \"identity experiments\" Create \"small wins\" that keep momentum going Survive the rocky period between career identities Connect with role models and mentors who can ease the transition Make time for reflection\u2014without missing out on windows of opportunity Decide when to abandon the old path in order to follow the new Arrange new events into a coherent story of who we are becoming. A call to the dreamer in each of us, Working Identity explores the process for crafting a more fulfilling future.

By far the most serious and general collapse came during the decade of depression and banking crises which overtook the whole colony after 1885. Auckland's commercial elite, which had dominated the city's business for a generation and had launched some of New Zealand's most important financial institutions, was discredited. Some of its members were impoverished. In the 1890s this failure was explained in moralistic terms. It was seen as the just penalty for speculative rashness. Makers of Fortune suggests that although optimism was almost an Auckland trait and was incited by rapid city growth, other economic forces were also at work. There was, for one, the ease with which funds could be obtained from abroad. Many Auckland businessmen tried to make their way by the application of the Victorian ideal of self-help. Some succeeded; other failed after early success.

Arguments could rage forever, but no professional would dispute that Anthony Bolton of Fidelity is among the very best. \u00a31,000 invested in his Special Situations fund at its launch in 1979 was worth more than \u00a3125,000 twenty seven years later. No other mainstream UK fund manager has put together such a consistently impressive performance over such a long period. The 125-fold increase represents an average compound growth rate of more than 20% per annum, or 7% per annum greater than the FTSE All-Share Index over the same period. This track record of sustained outperformance stands comparison with that of the greatest American investment superstars such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch. For many years, until the fund was voluntarily split in 2006, Fidelity Special Situations was easily the largest and most popular fund in the UK. What are the secrets of Anthony Bolton's success? This important book, now fully revised and updated, takes an in-depth look at the way that Bolton goes about his business and analyses in detail the fund's outstanding performance. Anthony Bolton gives his own personal account of the history of the fund, explains why he believes his contrarian stockpicking methods have worked so well for so long and summarises the lessons he has learnt from his long and succesful career. This book is required reading for anyone with a personal or professional interest in investment. - Fully revised and updated second edition with 25 pages of new material and graphics. - The only full-length book to analyse in detail the strategies and techniques used by the UK's number one professional investor. - Detailed analysis of the performance of his funds and the lessons that investors can draw from its exceptional track record. - Written jointly by Anthony Bolton and one of the UK's best known financial authors, a leading authority on the fund management business.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780857190994"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0857190997"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 209, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.3.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1098.45, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 549.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jYrNAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1098450000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 549220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Investing_with_Anthony_Bolton-sample-epub.acsm?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Investing_with_Anthony_Bolton-sample-pdf.acsm?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jYrNAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book is required reading for anyone with a personal or professional interest in investment. - Fully revised and updated second edition with 25 pages of new material and graphics."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "-ydNYWGIussC", "etag": "3GYNBJNl63Q", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/-ydNYWGIussC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Quants", "subtitle": "How a New Breed of Math Whizzes Conquered Wall Street and Nearly Destroyed It", "authors": ["Scott Patterson"], "publisher": "Currency", "publishedDate": "2010-02-02", "description": "With the immediacy of today\u2019s NASDAQ close and the timeless power of a Greek tragedy, The Quants is at once a masterpiece of explanatory journalism, a gripping tale of ambition and hubris, and an ominous warning about Wall Street\u2019s future. In March of 2006, four of the world\u2019s richest men sipped champagne in an opulent New York hotel. They were preparing to compete in a poker tournament with million-dollar stakes, but those numbers meant nothing to them. They were accustomed to risking billions. On that night, these four men and their cohorts were the new kings of Wall Street. Muller, Griffin, Asness, and Weinstein were among the best and brightest of a new breed, the quants. Over the prior twenty years, this species of math whiz--technocrats who make billions not with gut calls or fundamental analysis but with formulas and high-speed computers--had usurped the testosterone-fueled, kill-or-be-killed risk-takers who\u2019d long been the alpha males the world\u2019s largest casino. The quants helped create a digitized money-trading machine that could shift billions around the globe with the click of a mouse. Few realized, though, that in creating this unprecedented machine, men like Muller, Griffin, Asness and Weinstein had sowed the seeds for history\u2019s greatest financial disaster. Drawing on unprecedented access to these four number-crunching titans, The Quants tells the inside story of what they thought and felt in the days and weeks when they helplessly watched much of their net worth vaporize--and wondered just how their mind-bending formulas and genius-level IQ\u2019s had led them so wrong, so fast.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307453396"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307453391"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 10, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "3.5.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-ydNYWGIussC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-ydNYWGIussC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-ydNYWGIussC&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-ydNYWGIussC&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Quants.html?hl=&id=-ydNYWGIussC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-ydNYWGIussC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Drawing on unprecedented access to these four number-crunching titans, The Quants tells the inside story of what they thought and felt in the days and weeks when they helplessly watched much of their net worth vaporize--and wondered just ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QN_dDpJo1cEC", "etag": "kGWENnH4pw8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QN_dDpJo1cEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Basic Business Library", "subtitle": "Core Resources and Services", "authors": ["Eric Forte", "Michael R.

Fact is, as indexing and quasi-indexing have become more prevalent, the dangers of these strategies have become more pronounced: a bias toward overvalued, overgrown, large-cap stocks likely to hit long periods of underperformance. But there's good news: If you're willing to invest a bit more of your own time, you have a much better chance of beating the pros than they want you to think. In Beating the Indexes, leading trader and Minyanville columnist Bill Feingold shows you how to systematically exploit the biases and mediocrity of index investors, and continuously make winning investments. Writing for individual investors as well as professional advisors and money managers, Feingold introduces a more profitable set of investing strategies based on convertible bonds and related alternative investments.

At a time when individuals have to make important decisions about saving for college and 401(k) retirement funds, this failure to provide a basic education in investing can have tragic consequences. For those who know what to look for, investment opportunities are everywhere. The average high-school student is familiar with Nike, Reebok, McDonald\u2019s, the Gap, and the Body Shop. Nearly every teenager in America drinks Coke or Pepsi, but only a very few own shares in either company or even understand how to buy them. Every student studies American history, but few realize that our country was settled by European colonists financed by public companies in England and Holland\u2014and the basic principles behind public companies haven\u2019t changed in more than three hundred years. In Learn to Earn, Lynch and Rothchild explain in a style accessible to anyone who is high-school age or older how to read a stock table in the daily newspaper, how to understand a company annual report, and why everyone should pay attention to the stock market. They explain not only how to invest, but also how to think like an investor.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781476712031"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1476712034"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.12.12.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 223.02, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 198.45, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC&rdid=book-9ejeb7Duc5cC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 223020000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 198450000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Learn_to_Earn-sample-epub.acsm?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9ejeb7Duc5cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Many investors, including some with substantial portfolios, have only the sketchiest idea of how the stock market works."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "GI23AAAAIAAJ", "etag": "WRcFowwWqY4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GI23AAAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Portable MBA in Investment", "authors": ["Peter L.

That's not a new story. But what is new is the \"wise pivot,\" a replicable strategy for harnessing disruption to survive, grow, and be relevant to the future. It's a strategy for perpetual reinvention across the old, now, and new elements of any business. Rapid recent advances in technology are forcing leaders in every business to rethink long-held beliefs about how to adapt to emerging technologies and new markets. What has become abundantly clear: in the digital age, conventional wisdom about business transformation no longer works, if it ever did. Based on Accenture's own experience of reinventing itself in the face of disruption, the company's real world client work, and a rigorous two-year study of thousands of businesses across 30 industries, Pivot to the Future reveals methodical and bold moves for finding and releasing new sources of trapped value-unlocked by bridging the gap between what is technologically possible and how technologies are being used. The freed value enables companies to simultaneously reinvent their legacy, and current and new businesses. Pivot to the Future is for leaders who seek to turn the existential threats of today and tomorrow into sustainable growth, with the courage to understand that a wise pivot strategy is not a one-time event, but a commitment to a future of perpetual reinvention, where one pivot is followed by the next and the next.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781529325249"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1529325242"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Careers+in+business+and+investments&hl=&cd=111&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1392.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 696.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DxuKDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1392400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 696200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Pivot_to_the_Future-sample-epub.acsm?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DxuKDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Pivot to the Future is for leaders who seek to turn the existential threats of today and tomorrow into sustainable growth, with the courage to understand that a wise pivot strategy is not a one-time event, but a commitment to a future of ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9Io9IBhCMBwC", "etag": "tYJ0tVk+NBA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9Io9IBhCMBwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Real Estate Game", "subtitle": "The Intelligent Guide To Decisionmaking And Investment", "authors": ["William J Poorvu", "Jeffrey L.

David Bornstein's previous book on social entrepreneurship, How to Change the World, was hailed by Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times as \"a bible in the field\" and published in more than twenty countries. Now, Bornstein shifts the focus from the profiles of successful social innovators in that book--and teams with Susan Davis, a founding board member of the Grameen Foundation--to offer the first general overview of social entrepreneurship. In a Q & A format allowing readers to go directly to the information they need, the authors map out social entrepreneurship in its broadest terms as well as in its particulars. Bornstein and Davis explain what social entrepreneurs are, how their organizations function, and what challenges they face. The book will give readers an understanding of what differentiates social entrepreneurship from standard business ventures and how it differs from traditional grant-based non-profit work. Unlike the typical top-down, model-based approach to solving problems employed by the World Bank and other large institutions, social entrepreneurs work through a process of iterative learning -- learning by doing--working with communities to find unique, local solutions to unique, local problems. Most importantly, the book shows readers exactly how they can get involved. Anyone inspired by Barack Obama's call to service and who wants to learn more about the essential features and enormous promise of this new method of social change, Social Entrepreneurship: What Everyone Needs to Know? is the ideal first place to look.
