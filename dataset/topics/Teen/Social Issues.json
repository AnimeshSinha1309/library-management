Sociologists assert that hypotheses can be formulated and tested against empirical evidence, that faulty viewpoints can be uncovered and discarded, and that plausible theory can be distinguished from mere ideology. This collection was written over a span of forty-four years and is presented in the belief that sociology is a science.In Social Problems, Social Issues, Social Science, James D. Wright presents his research on some of the social issues that have most vexed America: homelessness, addiction, divorce, minimum wage, and gun control, among others. Starting with essays first published in the flagship journal Society, Wright offers readers a foundational look at specific social problems and the methods sociologists have used to study them. He then provides an up-to-date re-examination of each issue, analysing the changes that have occurred over time and how sociologists have responded to it.This book is both a retrospective on the field and on one scholar's life and work. Using his own experience in researching and writing about America's most trenchant social issues, Wright describes the evolution of the methods and theory used by social scientists to understand and, ultimately, to confront America's most troublesome social problems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781351489751"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1351489755"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 318, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Problems_Social_Issues_Social_Sci.html?hl=&id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Problems_Social_Issues_Social_Sci-sample-epub.acsm?id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Problems_Social_Issues_Social_Sci-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NiAxDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This collection was written over a span of forty-four years and is presented in the belief that sociology is a science.In Social Problems, Social Issues, Social Science, James D.

While China\u2019s economic progress has been commendable, the social problems that go with economic changes have raised serious concerns. Some of those concerns are related to gender, ethnic, labor, and environmental issues. This book is about what has happened in these arenas in China since the opening up and reform in 1978. The study of gender, ethnicity, labor, and environment touches on some of the fundamental problems of modernization, especially the development of individuals and groups. So even though gender, ethnicity, labor, and environment seem to be separate issues, they are in fact related in some fundamental ways. That\u2019s what this book will explore as well. To understand is one thing and to do is another. This book also incorporates studies of NGO practices to see how NGOs have helped in transforming gender, ethnic, labor, and environment interplay. Our study of NGOs in helping improve such interplay sheds light on how specifically civil society can prod the state to transform social relations for the better. This book is an attempt to assess the changes, both positive and negative, in gender, ethnic, ethnic, and environmental relations in China especially in the past 30 years of opening up and reform, especially regarding national identity formation. \u200b", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461422242"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461422248"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 332, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Issues_in_China-sample-epub.acsm?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Issues_in_China-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Lg5_AAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "So even though gender, ethnicity, labor, and environment seem to be separate issues, they are in fact related in some fundamental ways.

It is accessible to the uninitiated, who are not familiar with the constructionist literature, and aimed at those who are not particularly interested in subtle theoretical and empirical issues of concern to academics studying social problems from constructionist perspectives. Some readings focus on the construction of problems by scientists and other professionals; others examine the work of social activists, mass media, and social service personnel. Among the topics included are studies of social inequalities and individual deviance; a comparison of the images of social problems in the United States with those in other countries; and an examination of the importance of politics and power in constructing public images of social problems. Constructionist perspectives have become the leading theoretical approach for sociology and allied fields in studying social problems. Yet constructionists' impact on the teaching of social problems has been far less dramatic. Undergraduate courses on social problems are often subject to a theoretical barrage of eclectic perspectives. Just as the first social problems textbooks did almost a century ago, textbooks continue to present a series of unrelated chapters, each devoted to a particular social problem. Social Problems is an effort at systematic analysis rather than random thought on the subject. Social Problems presents detailed case studies demonstrating how constructionist perspectives can actually be applied to understand particular social problems. While these articles can be read alone, the editors have organized these selections to correspond with the chapter topics in the second edition of Donileen Loseke's Thinking about Social Problems, an accessible introduction to constructionist approaches. At the same time, some instructors who use this edited collection might wish to provide their own mix to the selection process. Many of the contributions make multiple points and so reasonably could be used to illustrate other basic texts or classic studies in the field of social problems. Donileen R. Loseke is professor of sociology at the University of South Florida. Joel Best is professor and chair, Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, University of Delaware. He has also served as an advisory editor for Aldine in the area of social problems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0202307034"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780202307039"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 277, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Problems.html?hl=&id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Problems-sample-epub.acsm?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Problems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This collection of focused essays is directed at several levels of students of social problems."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "SXRRYgEACAAJ", "etag": "gZs++o/p394", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/SXRRYgEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Local Issues, Global Impact", "subtitle": "Perspectives on Contemporary Social Issues", "authors": ["Michael Stern"], "publisher": "Cognella Academic Publishing", "publishedDate": "2011-11", "description": "\"Local Issues, Global Impact: Perspectives on Contemporary Social Issues provides students with first-rate, interdisciplinary articles that examine and inform us on contemporary social issues at the local and global levels.

In these still-relevant lectures, Rudolf Steiner shows that today's political, economic, and social problems are symptoms of our faulty thinking. His convincing analysis of economic crises, unemployment, and political uprisings unmasks such problems as signs of our desperate need for new thinking. In a very accessible way, Steiner describes how spiritual science and the kind of thinking it fosters can lead to a renewal of society and to true freedom for individuals. In view of the current condition of our economy and the seeming chaos of international politics, Steiner's insights come as a fresh breeze that awakens us to responsibility and renewed hope. In passionate, lucid language, Steiner presents his vision of the threefold social order, a system based on free will and spiritual insight. CONTENTS Foreword by Sabine H.

The authors (many of whom, themselves, are noted professors of education and who have done significant work in the field of social issues and education) delineate and analyze the efforts (e.g., theoretical work, research, curriculum development, and teaching) of such pioneers within the larger framework of their lifestory.

The partnership is called Rethinking Africa Programme, which is consistent with the 21st century ideals of Africa's renewal. Its key objective is to re-think Africa through academic and research initiatives sensitive to our own experiences as Africans, as well as through a critical revisiting of western-based social sciences in order to build new analytical models and concepts that capture processes and dynamics that derive from African experiences. It thus has as its related aim, to counter the proliferation of texts by western scholars on African social issues which dominate lecture rooms and libraries as teaching and learning resources in African universities. It is hoped that this volume will encourage future partnerships on research and teaching of contemporary African social issues amongst African scholars within the continent.

How are decisions really made 'behind the scenes'? How do programme makers push boundaries without losing viewers? What do audiences take away from their viewing experience? Does TV fiction have a greater impact on public understandings than TV news? This exciting new book draws on unique empirical data to examine the relationship between popular television fiction and wider society.The book gives lively and engaging insights into how and why socially sensitive story lines were taken up by different TV programmes from the late 1980s to the 2000s. Drawing on a series of case studies of medicine, health, illness and social problems including breast cancer, mental distress, sexual abuse and violence it comprehensively traces the path of storylines from initial conception through to audience reception and uses contemporary examples to link practice to theory.

Cahnman representing four decades (1940-1980) of work by an extraordinary, multidisciplinary scholar. Cahnman's work encompasses the experiences of a German Jewish refugee, an economist turned sociologist, and a scholar of Judaism. Part 1 contains personal and autobiographical writings and includes analyses of the cultural ambiguities of Jewish assimilation in Germany and Austria. Part 2 is devoted to sociological essays ranging from a critical assessment of Gunnar Myrdal's landmark study of the problems of race and democracy, An American Dilemma, to a probing look at the stigma of obesity, based on empirical research, a subject very much in the news today and that shows Cahnman ahead of his time. Part 3 offers some of Cahnman's most perceptive essays dealing with geopolitical themes. Included are theoretically based writings that help to clarify the methods and concepts of geopolitics, marking the intellectual beginnings of the global approach to world affairs. Here Cahnman broached the possibility of a united Europe (1944), realized sixty years later in the formation of the European Union. The twelve essays of Part 4 return to Cahnman's ever-present concern with Jews and Judaism. They present a wide-ranging historical-sociological view, from the Jews of Vienna in the 1930s to the American scene in the 1960s, to the still-unresolved problematics of Arab-Israeli relations, with Cahnman arguing for coexistence and a two-state solution for Jews and Arabs. The volume, carefully selected and assembled by the editors, presents for the first time essays representing the full range of Werner Cahnman's scholarship and thought. It will be of interest to students of sociology, history, political science, and Judaic studies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781412809818"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1412809819"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 401, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U_4v94t3X0sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U_4v94t3X0sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=U_4v94t3X0sC&pg=PA127&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U_4v94t3X0sC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U_4v94t3X0sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4424.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4424.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U_4v94t3X0sC&rdid=book-U_4v94t3X0sC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4424070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4424070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Issues_Geopolitics_and_Judaica-sample-pdf.acsm?id=U_4v94t3X0sC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=U_4v94t3X0sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The article presents and clarifies the concept of Sozialpolitik in terms of <b>social</b> <br>\naction directed toward <b>problems</b> affecting society as a whole and the continued <br>\nattainment of society&#39;s goals.

Despite the wide diversity among these countries, a few general trends can be observed. Globalization has swept across Asia, bringing intensive economic interactions, with a strong commitment to liberalism and market capitalism. Wage labour has become the common form of employment. Individuals, as well as countries, are increasingly exposed to the competitive and uncertain global market. Employment protection, particularly for vulnerable labour groups \u2013 youth, women, seniors and migrants \u2013 has become a pressing issue for most Asian governments. Industrialization and urbanization have had a major impact on demographics, family structures and normative frameworks. The declining fertility rate has been recognized as a defining feature of a modern society, leading to small families and reducing instances of multi-generational co-residency. Changing family structures have contributed to changes in family values and roles, especially the role of women. Sometimes willingly, sometimes compelled, women are entering the workplace in increasing numbers, particularly as migrant workers. Similarly, the elderly are experiencing changes in their roles and participation in society. Family duties compete, and are often in conflict with, the demands of work. The issue of providing adequate and quality care to family members has been exacerbated by the fact that Asian societies are ageing. It is commonly acknowledged that, in Asian societies, personal care and support needs are primarily met by family \u2013 both immediate and extended \u2013 and, to a lesser degree, by community networks. Governments had gradually established their own social welfare systems in an effort to support economic growth and sustain their legitimacy by meeting certain recognized social needs. The success of these ventures varies across societies, and, naturally, there have been criticisms of the breadth and depth of these provisions. This book addresses social issues related to family, ageing and work that arise from these changes in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Philippine and Sri Lanka. These societies represent different levels of economic and social development, but face similar challenges and their social interventions can be usefully compared. This variety of subjects provides the reader with a more comprehensive understanding of the changes that have occurred, the problems that have emerged and the strategies that have been adopted. This volume provides insight into ways of addressing social issues in this rapidly changing part of the world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781443862813"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1443862819"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 275, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PR11&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5940.67, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5940.67, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-wtIxBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5940670000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5940670000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_Issues_and_Policies_in_Asia-sample-pdf.acsm?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wtIxBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "His research interests are in risk and <b>social</b> policy, comparative <b>social</b> policy, and <br>\nfamily and labour policies.

It confers social status on those who diagnose, and it impacts the social status of those diagnosed. Studying diagnosis from a sociological perspective offers clinicians and students a rich and sometimes provocative view of medicine and the cultures in which it is practiced. Social Issues in Diagnosis describes how diagnostic labels and the process of diagnosis are anchored in groups and structures as much as they are in the interactions between patient and doctor. The sociological perspective is informative, detailed, and different from what medical, nursing, social work, and psychology students\u2014and other professionals who diagnose or work with diagnoses\u2014learn in a pathophysiology or clinical assessment course. It is precisely this difference that should be integral to student and clinician education, enriching the professional experience with improved doctor-patient relationships and potentially better health outcomes. Chapters are written by both researchers and educators and reviewed by medical advisors. Just as medicine divides disease into diagnostic categories, so have the editors classified the social aspects of diagnosis into discrete areas of reflection, including\u2022 Classification of illness\u2022 Process of diagnosis\u2022 Phenomenon of uncertainty\u2022 Diagnostic labels\u2022 Discrimination\u2022 Challenges to medical authority\u2022 Medicalization\u2022 Technological influences\u2022 Self-diagnosis Additional chapters by clinicians, including New York Times columnist Lisa Sanders, M.D., provide a view from the front line of diagnosis to round out the discussion.

It provides a focus and a conceptual framework for thinking about education in light of these issues. Readers are exposed to the thinking of some of the best and most insightful social and educational commentators. Critical Social Issues in American Education: Democracy and Meaning in a Globalizing World, Third Edition, is intended to work on two levels. First, it helps readers to develop an awareness of how education is connected to the wider social structures of cultural, political, and economic life. Second, it encourages not only a critical examination of our present social reality but also a serious discussion of alternatives--of what a transformed society and educational process might look like. The editors' goal is to deliberately engage readers in connecting the work of teachers to an ethically committed, politically charged pedagogy. The assumption on which they base the text is that educators must see their work as inextricably linked to the broader conflicts, stresses, and crises of the social world--it is not otherwise possible to make sense of what is happening educationally. What happens in school, or as part of the educational experience, reflects, expresses, and mediates profound questions about the direction and nature of the society we inhabit. The text is organized thematically into five sections, which address, respectively, social justice and democracy; consumerism, culture, and public education; marginality and difference; moral and spiritual perspectives on education; and globalization and education. Each section is preceded by a brief essay that introduces the readings. This Third Edition includes many new readings and addresses issues that have more recently emerged as especially significant--such as concerns about the implications of globalization and the post 9/11 world, commercialism, violence, and the ever-increasing influence of high stakes testing. This compelling text is relevant for a wide range of courses in educational foundations, educational policy, curriculum studies, and multicultural education that address the social context of education, cultural and political change, and public policy.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135627430"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1135627436"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 520, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hKuPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hKuPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hKuPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PR11&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hKuPAgAAQBAJ&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_Social_Issues_in_American_Educa.html?hl=&id=hKuPAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hKuPAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... sometimes catastrophic, <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b>, such as poverty and growing <br>\n<b>social</b> injustice;

What values should we communicate and nurture? What should be the role of the traditional liberal arts in professional education? How should schools and colleges respond to the demands of women and minorities for a more inclusive curriculum? The authors explore ongoing theoretical and practical considerations of graduate professional education through the ethical and social issues facing professionals in public service. Administrators, teachers, counselors, nurses, or lawyers are recognizing that they face similar questions about their personal and professional lives: Is it possible to sustain a set of fully human values as a practicing professional? As a member of a public organization, how does one deal with dilemmas involving conflicting priorities and ambiguous goals? The authors responses to these questions are presented as themes, describing connections between curriculum and pedagogy. They have designed an approach to ethical and social questions respectful of the contributions of adult learners and the need to provide diverse perspectives.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0791419150"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780791419151"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 285, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cwAYBtDk4YYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cwAYBtDk4YYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cwAYBtDk4YYC&pg=PA207&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=62&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cwAYBtDk4YYC&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Ethical_and_Social_Issues_in_Professiona.html?hl=&id=cwAYBtDk4YYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ethical_and_Social_Issues_in_Professiona-sample-epub.acsm?id=cwAYBtDk4YYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ethical_and_Social_Issues_in_Professiona-sample-pdf.acsm?id=cwAYBtDk4YYC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cwAYBtDk4YYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Gender and Professional /Liberal Knowledge: Men&#39;s Perspectives JAMES <br>\nWALLACE The experiences and ideas presented in this chapter make it <br>\nappropriate to briefly revisit some of the <b>issues</b> of &quot;political correctness&quot; <br>\ndiscussed in the&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xLTiBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "cCPCrK2DOT0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xLTiBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Social Issues in Computing", "authors": ["C.

With a central focus on the problem of inequality and the manner in which this is manifested in crime, social class and stratification, this book examines the key theoretical perspectives relevant to the study and solution of social problems, whilst drawing upon rich illustrations and case studies from the US and Europe to offer a thorough examination of the nature, common root causes and social remedies of social problems. Providing discussions of both theoretical approaches and concrete applications, Social Problems and Inequality investigates the sources of various prejudices and attitudes that contribute to social problems and the associated issues of globalization, economic greed and imperialism.

Introductory one-semester course for freshman or sophomore non-majors without a background in economics. Real-world data analysis, games, and economic experiments for socially engaged readers Economic Analysis of Social Issues provides readers with a modern analytical approach to economics based on the tools of game theory. Readers who are passionate about contemporary social problems are given an analytical framework to discuss problems like pollution, health care, and the depletion of natural resources. Using fun, simple tools of game theory, readers discover that ultimately, these problems have similar origins. Readers will leave the course with a solid grasp of strategic behavior and understand how such behavior, exercised in the pursuit of individual incentives, can lead to poor collective outcomes. A user-friendly, conversational writing style infused with analytical rigor makes the text approachable and easy to read. Economic experiments and games not found in any other text about the subject, along with real-time data analysis exercises allow readers to learn by doing. This approach teaches readers to analyze social problems, rather than memorize facts that will soon become dated or irrelevant.

Focusing on current technological challenges involving multi-disciplinary problem analysis and systems engineering approaches, it provides an overview of the most relevant aspects of surveillance systems in the framework of homeland security. Addressing both advanced surveillance technologies and the related socio-ethical issues, the book consists of 21 chapters written by international experts from the various sectors of homeland security. Part I, Surveillance and Society, focuses on the societal dimension of surveillance\u2014stressing the importance of societal acceptability as a precondition to any surveillance system. Part II, Physical and Cyber Surveillance, presents advanced technologies for surveillance. It considers developing technologies that are part of a framework whose aim is to move from a simple collection and storage of information toward proactive systems that are able to fuse several information sources to detect relevant events in their early incipient phase. Part III, Technologies for Homeland Security, considers relevant applications of surveillance systems in the framework of homeland security. It presents real-world case studies of how innovative technologies can be used to effectively improve the security of sensitive areas without violating the rights of the people involved. Examining cutting-edge research topics, the book provides you with a comprehensive understanding of the technological, legislative, organizational, and management issues related to surveillance. With a specific focus on privacy, it presents innovative solutions to many of the issues that remain in the quest to balance security with the preservation of privacy that society demands.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439883242"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439883246"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 646, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wz1b2sQFxSsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wz1b2sQFxSsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wz1b2sQFxSsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=98&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wz1b2sQFxSsC&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Effective_Surveillance_for_Homeland_Secu.html?hl=&id=wz1b2sQFxSsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wz1b2sQFxSsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Addressing both advanced surveillance technologies and the related socio-ethical issues, the book consists of 21 chapters written by international experts from the various sectors of homeland security."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "t0wgAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "WC+SgbVbgE0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/t0wgAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Journal of Social Issues", "publishedDate": "1996", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015034491673"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Electronic journals"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.21.4.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t0wgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=99&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t0wgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Journal_of_Social_Issues.html?hl=&id=t0wgAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t0wgAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "jpCKDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "LiVZMVPq1GM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jpCKDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Social Justice and Islamic Economics", "subtitle": "Theory, Issues and Practice", "authors": ["Toseef Azid", "Lutfi Sunar"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2019-02-25", "description": "Under the rule of the current economic order, social injustice is ever-increasing. Issues such as poverty, inhumane working conditions, inadequate wages, social insecurity and an unhealthy labor market continue to persist. Many states are also unable to produce policies capable of resolving these problems. The characteristics of the capitalist system currently render it unable to provide social justice. In fact, on the contrary, the system reinforces these injustices and prevents economic and social welfare from reaching the masses. Many Muslim scholars have analyzed and, indeed, criticized this system for years. This book argues that an alternative and more equitable theoretical and practical economical order can been developed within the framework of Islamic principles. On the other hand, the experiences of societies under the rule of Muslim governments do not always seem to hold great promise for an alternative understanding of social justice. In addition, the behaviors of Muslim individuals within their economic lives are mostly shaped by the necessities of daily economic conditions rather than by the tenets of Islam that stand with social justice. Until 1990s, studies of Islamic economics made connections between finance and the notion of social justice, but work conducted more recently has neglected this issue. It is therefore evident that the topic of social justice needs to be revisited in a more in-depth manner. Filling an important gap in existing literature, the book uniquely connects social justice and Islamic finance and economics on this topic. Theory, practice and key issues are presented simultaneously throughout this book, which is based on the writings of a number of eminent scholars.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13",

Colleagues daily spoke of the moral and social problems of children's health care. Our offices were near the examining rooms where children had their bone-marrow procedures done. Since this is a painful test, we often heard them cry. The hospital floor where the sickest children stayed was also nearby. The physicians, nurses, and social workers believed that children's health care needs were not being met and that more could and should be done. Fewer resources are available for a child than for an adult with a comparable illness, they said. These experiences prompted us to prepare this volume and to ask whether children do get their fair share of the health care dollar. Since the question \"What kind of health care do we owe to our children?\" is complex, responses should be rooted in many disciplines. These include philosophy, law, public policy and, of course, the health professions. Representing all of these disciplines, contributors to this volume reflect on moral and social issues in children's health care. The last hundred years have brought great changes in health care tor children. The specialty of pediatrics developed during this period, and with it, a new group of advocates for children's health care. Women's suffrage gave a political boost to the recognition of children's special health needs.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780585274065"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0585274061"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-d9sLBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Children_and_Health_Care-sample-epub.acsm?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Children_and_Health_Care-sample-pdf.acsm?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=d9sLBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Colleagues daily spoke of the moral and social problems of children&#39;s health care.

This book examines and compares the sporting experiences of women from different countries around the world and offers the first systematic and cross-cultural analysis of the topic of women in sport. Sport and Women presents a wealth of new research data, including in-depth case-studies of 16 countries in North and South America, Asia, Eastern and Western Europe and Africa. In addition, the book offers comparative assessments of the extent to which women are represented in global sport and the opportunities that women have to participate in decision-making processes in sport. The book illuminates a wide range of key international issues in women's sport, such as cultural barriers to participation and the efficacy of political action. It is therefore essential reading for anybody with an interest in the sociology, culture and politics of sport.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781134578245"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1134578245"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FaaBAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FaaBAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FaaBAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FaaBAgAAQBAJ&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sport_and_Women.html?hl=&id=FaaBAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FaaBAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book examines and compares the sporting experiences of women by focusing on an extensive series of national case studies from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North and South America, and Asia."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "J5erJArq5gEC", "etag": "pmOyouXhQFY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/J5erJArq5gEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Sociology of Social Problems", "subtitle": "Theoretical Perspectives and Methods of Intervention", "authors": ["Adam Jamrozik", "Luisa Nocella"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "1998-07-13", "description": "This book develops a theoretical framework for the analysis of social problems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521599326"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521599320"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 241, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J5erJArq5gEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J5erJArq5gEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J5erJArq5gEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=110&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J5erJArq5gEC&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Sociology_of_Social_Problems.html?hl=&id=J5erJArq5gEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=J5erJArq5gEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Social problems such as unemployment, poverty and drug addiction are a fact of life in industrialised societies.

This book tackles many of the most pressing problems facing societies today. The authors demonstrate that similar social mechanisms lie behind many of these seemingly disparate problems. Indeed, many societal problems can be traced back to behaviours that are perfectly rational and often well-intended from an individual perspective. Yet, taken together these behaviours can \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 give rise to unintended and undesirable outcomes at the society level. In addition to addressing the causes of societal problems, the book explains why some problems rank higher on the public agenda than others. Moreover, it is shown how government intervention may sometimes provide a cure, yet other times exacerbate existing problems or create new problems of its own. This book includes an extensive amount of data on trends and geographic variation in the prevalence of different problems, as well as telling examples \u2013 both recent and historical \u2013 from a variety of countries to support its key arguments. Employing a bold multidisciplinary approach, the authors draw on insights from across the social sciences, including sociology, economics, anthropology, criminology, and psychology. Throughout the book, students are introduced to analytical concepts such as free-riding, herding behaviour, principal-agent relations and moral hazard. These concepts are essential tools for better understanding the roots of many societal problems that regularly make headlines in the news.

These forms of communication often appear in tandem with social problems, including riots, racial or political violence, and social and economic upheavals. The volume emphasizes the connection of rumor to a set of social concerns from government corruption and corporate scandal, to racial, religious, and other prejudices. Central to the dialogue are issues of truth, belief, history, public policy, and evidence.Rumor has been recognized as one of the most important contributing factors to violence and discrimination. Yet, despite its significance in exacerbating social discord and mistrust, little systematic scholarly attention has been paid to the political origins and consequences of rumor. Rumor is defined as a proposition for belief that is not backed by secure standards of evidence. Rumor can be traditional or not, and can be expressed as a simple claim of fact. In both instances groups of claim-makers, operating out of their own interests and with a set of resources, attempt to depict reality, and if possible, impact the future.The need for this book is underscored by changing patterns of technology. What in the past was grounded in face- to-face interaction is now often found on the Internet, which is a major source of rumor. An appreciation of how new electronic forms of communication affect communal belief is essential for explicating rumor dynamics. The volume is comprehensive. Essays cover race and ethnicity, migration and globalization, corporate malfeasance, and state and government corruption. While editors and contributors well appreciate the dynamic nature of rumors and legends, the high quality of the effort make it evident that the issues that are raised and reoccur will serve to channel and inspire research in this major field of communications research for years to come.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781351492522"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1351492527"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 281, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4482.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4482.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hD4rDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4482820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4482820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rumor_Mills-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hD4rDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The goal of this volume is to explore the social and political dynamics of rumor and the related concept of urban or contemporary legend."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "NRDcjVhbrPEC", "etag": "QnaPnD+ZmHg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NRDcjVhbrPEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ethical, Legal and Social Issues in Medical Informatics", "authors": ["Duquenoy, Penny", "George, Carlisle", "Kimppa, Kai"], "publisher": "IGI Global", "publishedDate": "2008-06-30", "description": "The utilization of information and communication technologies in almost all spheres of modern society has changed the social picture in significant ways while simultaneously leading to tensions with regard to traditional ethical and legal practices?particularly given the global context of its application.

It features analysis and case studies from an international body of researchers from Europe, the Americas and Australia. It includes contributions from Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, Croatia, Italy, Poland, Australia, and Brazil, that fully examine this increasingly prevalent, and global, issue. The book starts by introducing the problems of work-family linkages, shift work and non-standard work hours. Next, it details the consequences of specific features of shift schedules, such as decreased opportunities for social participation, family problems and negative effects on partners and children as well as the impact of working time arrangements on work-family conflict over time. The book then looks at the consequences of shift work and non-standard work hours on family members and the workers themselves, including the sleep and daytime functioning of adolescent family members and the ways that non-standard work schedules intersect with the particular challenges and stresses of family responsibilities and strategies that workers use to manage these challenges in sectors where non-standard schedules are the norm. Last, the book considers the role of individual differences in understanding problems of work-family relationships, including a consideration of safety and health at work from the perspective of gender and an examination of the moderating role of chronotype and circadian type characteristics on work-family conflict and work-family facilitation among male shift workers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319422862"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319422863"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 202, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Issues&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jTysDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_and_Family_Issues_in_Shift_Work_a-sample-epub.acsm?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Social_and_Family_Issues_in_Shift_Work_a-sample-pdf.acsm?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jTysDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book explores the effects of shift work and non standard working hours on family and social life.

Social work can take many forms, and is differently understood in different parts of the world. However, at base, it can be seen as a profession which strives to advance the causes of the vulnerable and marginalised with the aim of promoting social justice, equality, and human rights. This text provides examples of social work in a wide range of countries, informing our understanding of what social work is. It looks at how practice changes or stays the same, and at the impact of policy, as experienced by service users as well as by practitioners working in challenging circumstances. It also meaningfully reflects on the strengths and challenges that are enabled by diversity. Divided into four parts, this wide-ranging text discusses: - what social work means in four different countries -some examples of the impact social and political context can have on social work practice - how social workers see and work with the vulnerable - the future for social work, from disaster work to involving service users.
