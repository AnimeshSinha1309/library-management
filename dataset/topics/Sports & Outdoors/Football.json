Gridiron football is the king of sports \u2013 it's the biggest game in the strongest and richest country in the world. Of the twenty most-watched television broadcasts ever, both in the United States and internationally, all twenty were Super Bowls. In The King of Sports, Easterbrook tells the full story of how football became so deeply ingrained in American culture. Both good and bad, he examines its impact on American society at all levels of the game. The King of Sports explores these and many other topics: * The real harm done by concussions (it's not to NFL players). * The real way in which college football players are exploited (it's not by not being paid). * The way football helps American colleges (it's not bowl revenue) and American cities (it's not Super Bowl wins). * What happens to players who are used up and thrown away (it's not pretty). * The hidden scandal of the NFL (it's worse than you think). Using his year-long exclusive insider access to the Virginia Tech football program, where Frank Beamer has compiled the most victories of any active NFL or major-college head coach while also graduating players, Easterbrook shows how one big university \"does football right.\" Then he reports on what's wrong with football at the youth, high school, college and professional levels. Easterbrook holds up examples of coaches and programs who put the athletes first and still win; he presents solutions to these issues and many more, showing a clear path forward for the sport as a whole. Rich with reporting details from interviews with current and former college and pro football players and coaches, The King of Sports promises to be the most provocative and best-read sports book of the year.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781250011725"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1250011728"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.3.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PiMlRYQ1vfAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PiMlRYQ1vfAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PiMlRYQ1vfAC&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PiMlRYQ1vfAC&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_King_of_Sports.html?hl=&id=PiMlRYQ1vfAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=PiMlRYQ1vfAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In The King of Sports, Easterbrook tells the full story of how football became so deeply ingrained in American culture.

Because of the increase and push towards efficiency, it has become of greater interest to players, coaches, administrators, spectators and owners to identify psychological attributes and mental skills associated with superior sport performance as a primary stage of facilitating their development. However, there has been little research into the emotional factors affecting footballers at different levels, in particular, the mental toughness and hardiness of footballers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between mental toughness and hardiness of footballers and the level of football at which they perform. Mental toughness was assessed using the Psychological performance inventory. Hardiness was assessed using the Personal views survey III-R. Participants in the present study were 61 footballers from various clubs and 2 levels of performance: Playing recreational or elite football.Results are discussed relative to previous findings relevant to mental toughness and hardiness and future implications to aid the psychological development of footballers playing at different levels. Future research might concentrate further on psychological skills training, coping strategies and psychological preparation strategies in a wider variation of sports specific to a wider range of athletes, from grass roots to international level.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783954891252"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3954891255"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 64, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mAOnAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mAOnAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mAOnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mAOnAgAAQBAJ&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Mental_Toughness_and_Hardiness_at_Differ.html?hl=&id=mAOnAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mAOnAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "on, or usually take part in other <b>sports</b> which is why they are not totally committed <br>\nor dedicated to <b>football</b>, in this case.

This book provides the reader with advice on the treatment and prevention of illnesses and football-related injuries. The most recent discoveries in performance diagnostics provide coaches and players with better tools to address the fitness requirements of the players or the training recommendations. These tools can also be of help in assembling a team. In this book, the authors provide up-to-date sports medical findings taken from practical experience with world class teams and make them accessible for the readers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781782550471"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "178255047X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 200, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GHR8BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GHR8BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GHR8BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GHR8BgAAQBAJ&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sports_Medicine_for_Football.html?hl=&id=GHR8BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GHR8BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "FOREWORD. <b>Sports</b> medicine content and knowledge tend to be given either too <br>\nlittle or too much importance, particularly in professional <b>football</b>; it is rare for <br>\n<b>sports</b> medicine issues to be dealt with in a balanced way.

In this book she guides the reader through EU sports law, the specificities of the sporting industry and the problems and power struggles in European football governance in the context of the breakaway threats by elite clubs. In order to analyse the legality of UEFA clauses that restrict the formation of such breakaway structures, the author first provides a progressive interpretation of the applicable EU sports law and an in-depth analytical review of EU sports cases decided under internal market and competition provisions, including a novel perspective on the UEFA home-grown rule and the Bosman case. Thereafter, she sets out an original theory of convergence between TFEU provisions on competition and the internal market in the light of sporting exceptions. Finally, in applying the legal principles thus outlined Katarina Pijetlovic explores the legality of the restrictive UEFA clauses and the case for the formation of alternative leagues in European football under EU sports law. A number of surprising outcomes emerge from this analytical process. Conversely, she also tests the largely neglected issue of the legality of forming a breakaway league by the European elite football clubs. The systematic way in which the reader is guided through EU sports law and the legal issues under consideration makes the book accessible for EU lawyers as well as non-EU sports lawyers, on both an academic and a practitioner\u2019s level. Katarina Pijetlovic holds licentiate and doctoral degrees in EU sports law from the University of Helsinki.

Though millions experienced the thrills of college and professional football firsthand during these years, many more encountered the game through their daily newspapers or the weekly Saturday Evening Post, on radio broadcasts, and in the newsreels and feature films shown at their local movie theaters. Asking what football meant to these millions who followed it either casually or passionately, Michael Oriard reconstructs a media-created world of football and explores its deep entanglements with a modernizing American society. Football, claims Oriard, served as an agent of \"Americanization\" for immigrant groups but resisted attempts at true integration and racial equality, while anxieties over the domestication and affluence of middle-class American life helped pave the way for the sport's rise in popularity during the Cold War. Underlying these threads is the story of how the print and broadcast media, in ways specific to each medium, were powerful forces in constructing the football culture we know today.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780807864036"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "080786403X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 512, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.7.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JShnAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JShnAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JShnAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JShnAQAAQBAJ&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/King_Football.html?hl=&id=JShnAQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/King_Football-sample-epub.acsm?id=JShnAQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JShnAQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Sport</b> and Spectacle in the Golden Age of Radio and Newsreels, Movies and <br>\nMagazines, the Weekly and the Daily Press ...

The book challenges conventional histories of nineteenth-century football that surrounded mass games and the public schools and extends the revisionist critique of those histories with the imaginative use of new and original empirical evidence. It outlines the continuing presence of a working-class footballing culture across the century, arguing that the structure of football was a product of industrialisation, urbanisation and population growth that had resulted in a far-reaching restructuring of the class system and urban hierarchies. It was these new hierarchies and class system that gave birth to professional football by the late 1870s. It is essential reading for students of sports studies, economic, social and cultural history, urban and local history, and sociology, as well as a valuable resource for scholars and academics involved in the study of football across the world.

In Contesting Identities Aaron Baker examines how these cinematic representations of sports and athletes have evolved over time--from The Pinch Hitter and Buster Keaton's College to White Men Can't Jump, Jerry Maguire, and Girlfight. He focuses on how identities have been constructed and transcended in American society since the early twentieth century. Whether depicting team or individual sports, these films return to that most American of themes, the master narrative of self-reliance. Baker shows that even as sports films tackle socially constructed identities like class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender, they ultimately underscore transcendence of these identities through self-reliance. Looking at films from almost every sporting genre--with a particular focus on movies about boxing, baseball, basketball, and football--Contesting Identities maps the complex cultural landscape depicted in American sports films and the ways in which stories about \"subaltern\" groups winning acceptance by the mainstream majority can serve to reinforce the values of that majority. In addition to discussing the genre's recurring dramatic tropes, from the populist prizefighter to the hot-headed rebel to the \"manly\" female athlete, Baker also looks at the social and cinematic impacts of real-life sports figures from Jackie Robinson and Babe Didrikson Zaharias to Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0252060423"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780252060427"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 359, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C&pg=PA119&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=45&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sports_in_the_Western_World.html?hl=&id=rkuAiv3LoR4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Of all the team <b>sports</b> that became organized in the nineteenth century, <b>football</b> <br>\nwas the most international in appeal and diverse in form.

Processes of Europeanization in the fields of economy and politics provided the background for transformations of the production and consumption of football on a transnational scale. In the course of such rearrangements, football tournaments like the UEFA Championship or the European Champions League turned into mega-events and media spectacles attracting ever-growing audiences. The experience of participating in these events offers some of the very few occasions for the display and embodiment of identities within a European context. This volume takes the 2008 EUROs hosted by Austria and Switzerland as a case study to analyze the political and cultural significance of the tournament from a multidisciplinary angle. What are the special features and spatial arrangements of a UEFAesque Europe, in comparison to alternative possibilities of a Europe? Situating the sport tournament between interpretations of collective European ritual and European spectacle, the key research question will ask what kind of Europe was represented in the cultural, political and economic manifestations of the 2008 EUROs.

Yet whilst the language of sport seems to be universal, American sports culture remains highly distinctive. Why is this so? How should we understand American sport?

Understanding American Sports offers discussion and critical analysis of the everyday sporting and leisure activities of \u2018ordinary\u2019 Americans as well as the \u2018big three\u2019 (football, baseball, basketball), and elite sports heroes.

The white paper consists of three policy discussions, on the social value of sport, the economic value of sport, and the organisation of sport. Various action points emerge from the discussions, and with the white paper these form the Action Plan Pierre de Coubertin (included as an appendix to this report). There is a lack of competence for sport under existing EU treaties, though not under the Reform, or Lisbon, treaty. The report examines the content of the white paper and sport and EU law in detail. The Committee believes that sport has distinctive characteristics that need to be taken into account in the application of EU law. Much of the white paper is useful in exploring scope for using existing networks and programmes to support participation in sport. But the Committee does not believe there is any justification or necessity for the Commission to take a more active role in driving the development of policy on sport, and notes the alarm created by the lack of a clear statement on the autonomy of sports organisations.

This book is composed of five parts: Part I deals with the law and business of sports in the United States, with the primary emphasis on the legal aspects of professional sports. Part II deals with the internationalization of sports from various perspectives, principally North American team sports. Part III explores the law and business of sports in 18 non-U.S. jurisdictions--subject matter hardly covered in other sources, if at all. Part IV treats the legal and, to some extent, business aspects of broadcasting and sports, both in the United States and in selected foreign jurisdictions. Part V focuses upon sports marketing in its various forms in the United States, as well as its international perspectives. This easy-to-read work is unmatched in that it covers subjects not addressed or only tangentially addressed in other works, presents insiders perspectives on the subject matter, and focuses extensively on international aspects of sports law and business in connection with many different subjects.

According to the accepted wisdom, the refined football games created by English public schools in the 1860s subsequently became the sports of the masses. Football, The First Hundred Years, provides a revisionist history of the game, challenging previously widely-accepted beliefs. Harvey argues that established football history does not correspond with the facts. Football, as played by the 'masses' prior to the adoption of the public school codes is almost always portrayed as wild and barbaric. This view may require considerable modification in the light of Harvey's research. Football's First One Hundred Years provides a very detailed picture of the football played outside the confines of the public schools, revealing a culture that was every bit as sophisticated and influential as that found within their prestigious walls. Football, The First Hundred Yearssets forth a completely revisionist thesis, offering a different perspective on almost every aspect of the established history of the formative years of the game.

It is written by a range of concerned academics and writers, all of whom have an active relationship with the contemporary football world. The book assesses the changes that have occurred in many areas of football culture and the political and academic debates that have accompanied these changes. English football in particular, it seems, is 'fat city'. The Premiership, now eight years old, has, via satellite television, become a globalised phenomenon: there are Liverpool supporters in Bangladesh, Chelsea fans in sub-Saharan Africa and Manchester United followers across the globe. Grounds are full. Top class football attracts people to bars and pubs in huge numbers. Hooliganism appears a thing of the past. Everyone seems to love football and/or to support a team. The British football media are generally euphoric in their rendering of contemporary football culture. However, the contributors to this book argue that the heavily commodified, PR-driven and cartelised British football world, with which so many contemporary politicians and other public figures rush to identify themselves, has either created, exacerbated or continued to ignore serious problems of social exclusion problems of class and community, race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality and age.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135763930"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1135763933"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MumQAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MumQAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MumQAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA184&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MumQAgAAQBAJ&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/British_Football_Social_Exclusion.html?hl=&id=MumQAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MumQAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The <b>football</b> coach and the club scout were born.

The market forces that have defined commercialization, notably pay-per-view television, whilst initially welcomed as important new sources of revenue, have also had the unanticipated consequences of de-stabilizing many sporting competitions and institutions, undermining the financial future of clubs in their traditional role as key social and cultural institutions. This has been manifested in the paradox of chronic financial loss-making amongst professional sports\u2019 clubs in an era of exponential revenue growth, a trend exemplified by the experience of Italy\u2019s Series A and the English Premier League \u2013 both cases examined in detail in this book. But, at the same time, some traditional sporting organizations have sought with some success, to chart a middle way, retaining traditional sporting movement objectives whilst also embracing a form of commercialism. The Gaelic Athletic Association in Ireland, the supporter-owned FC Barcelona football club, and New Zealand rugby union, offer illustrative examples of such strategies examined in detail. This book explores the background to this clash of commercial and traditional sporting objectives, and debates the consequences for wider sports governance.

Egon Franck, University of Zurich, Switzerland The development of sports economics has exploded in recent years, and this well-researched and relevant book explores some of the most critical themes. Contemporary Issues in Sports Economics examines topics that have previously received little attention in the literature, such as the determinants and social impacts of sports participation including the link to crime levels. The distinguished authors also discuss some of the less investigated aspects of professional team sports, including: sports betting, financing and governance; the impact of low scoring matches on competitive balance and fan appeal in European football; and the effect on player transfers of a luxury tax on club payrolls in Major League Baseball. This invaluable book will appeal to graduate and postgraduate students in sports economics, sport management and sport sciences, as well as managers and coaches involved with clubs, leagues and federations.

Reflecting back on my years of service as the International Olympic Com mittee president, I cannot overlook the remarkable changes that have taken place in the world of sports during these two decades. The technological de velopment and consequent globalization of the world economy opened up a window of new opportunities for the sports industry.

The book analyses football and gender to reveal the subtle forms of discrimination that persist. It is important to highlight the many challenges and transformations made by girls and women but more importantly to consider the ways power continues to operate to devalue and undermine girls and women involved in the game. The UK-based authors make use of their recent research findings to offer critical debate on girls\u2019 and women\u2019s current experiences of British football cultures.

How can a sport psychologist help elite footballers perform at their maximum level? In this groundbreaking guide to the role of the sport psychologist within elite and professional football, leading sport psychologist Mark Nesti argues that working closely with coaches and players to create a receptive environment is vital if psychologists are to add maximum value to team and individual performances. Drawing on a decade\u2019s professional experience working at the top level of English football, Nesti offers a detailed guide to delivering sport psychology in an elite team sport environment, from practical drills on the training field to shaping organizational behaviour at club level. The book explores the full range of issues and themes that define the role of the professional sport psychologist working in football today, including: mental skills training group cohesion and team dynamics counselling, trust and confidentiality transitions in football managerial and coaching philosophies structure, communication and organizational psychology. The book is illustrated throughout with real-world case studies, drawing on research into sixteen professional clubs across five European countries, and concludes by suggesting how other elite team sports can learn from the experiences of professional football. This is the only book to outline a holistic approach to psychology in football and the to offer such a rich combination of theory and practice. It is therefore essential reading for all students of sport psychology and all psychologists and coaches working in elite team sport.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135284923"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "113528492X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jWGOAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jWGOAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jWGOAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=82&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jWGOAgAAQBAJ&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Psychology_in_Football.html?hl=&id=jWGOAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jWGOAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Professional team <b>sports</b> cultures, such as those found in <b>football</b>, are entirely <br>\ndifferent from what is usually encountered in lower-level and amateur sporting <br>\nenvironments.

This is the first book to focus on the increasingly complex series of migratory processes that contour the contemporary game, drawing on multi-disciplinary approaches from sociology, history, geography and anthropology to explore migration in football in established, emerging and transitional contexts. The book examines shifting migration patterns over time and across space, and analyses the sociological dynamics that drive and influence those patterns. It presents in-depth case studies of migration in elite men\u2019s football, exploring the role of established leagues in Europe and South America as well as important emerging leagues on football's frontier in North America and Asia. The final section of the book analyses the movement of groups who have rarely been the focus of migration research before, including female professional players, elite youth players, amateur players and players\u2019 families, drawing on important new research in Ghana, England, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Few other sports have such a global reach and therefore few other sports are such an important location for cross-cultural research and insight across the social sciences.

Scott Fitzgerald", "authors": ["McDonald Jarom", "Jarom McDonald"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2009-06-01", "description": "This study examines the ways that F. Scott Fitzgerald portrayed organized spectator sports as working to help structure ideologies of class, community, and nationhood. Situating the study in the landscape of late nineteenth/early twentieth-century American sport culture, Chapter One shows how narratives of attending ballgames, reading or listening to sports media, and being a 'fan,' cultivate communities of spectatorship. Adopting this same framework, the next three chapters explore how Fitzgerald's literary representations of sport culture express the complexities of American society. Chapter Two specifically considers the 'intense and dramatic spectacle' of college football in 'This Side of Paradise' as a means of exploring links between spectatorship, emulation and ideology. Chapter Three continues with college football as its theme, but this time looks at how it is portrayed in Fitzgerald's short stories, in order to scrutinize the relationship between the performative aspects of sport and the performative aspects of social class. Finally, Chapter Four scrutinizes how The Great Gatsby critiques the romantic nationalist ideology of 'America's game' by revealing the class divisions and tensions of baseball's spectator culture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415803038"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415803039"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 8, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vTxLPrFSV3cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vTxLPrFSV3cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vTxLPrFSV3cC&pg=PA39&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vTxLPrFSV3cC&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sports_Narrative_and_Nation_in_the_Ficti.html?hl=&id=vTxLPrFSV3cC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sports_Narrative_and_Nation_in_the_Ficti-sample-epub.acsm?id=vTxLPrFSV3cC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sports_Narrative_and_Nation_in_the_Ficti-sample-pdf.acsm?id=vTxLPrFSV3cC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vTxLPrFSV3cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "\u201cThere is really much to be said in favor of <b>football</b>, and much has been well said <br>\nand explains why the <b>sport</b> has acquired its tenacious hold upon players and <br>\nspectators,\u201d writes Walter Camp in The Book of <b>Football</b>, published in 1910 as <br>\npart&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "fiosdTntJz0C", "etag": "9RtAKXHikMM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fiosdTntJz0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Football for Peace", "subtitle": "Teaching and Playing Sport for Conflict Resolution in the Middle East", "authors": ["John Sugden", "James Wallis"], "publisher": "Meyer & Meyer Verlag", "publishedDate": "2007-01", "description": "This volume looks at how sport - and football in particular - can be used to cross cultural, personal, and religious boundaries to provide an atmosphere of co-existence.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781841261812"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1841261815"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 180, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fiosdTntJz0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fiosdTntJz0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fiosdTntJz0C&pg=PA141&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fiosdTntJz0C&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Football_for_Peace.html?hl=&id=fiosdTntJz0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Football_for_Peace-sample-epub.acsm?id=fiosdTntJz0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fiosdTntJz0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Teaching and Playing <b>Sport</b> for Conflict Resolution in the Middle East John <br>\nSugden ...

Circumstances and events generating legal issues in sport are similarly universal, but sport operates under many legal systems worldwide. Fragmentation and inconsistency in legal outcomes often result. This innovative collection of essays by leading scholars of sports law addresses a gap in the literature. It advances understanding of how different legal systems respond to common issues and offers insights into the developing international system of sports law. Researchers will find this book of inescapable assistance and interest. Hayden Opie, Melbourne Law School, Australia Nafziger and Ross have provided an enormously useful collection of incisive and integrating essays that cover the gamut of important issues in the emerging field of international sport law. Andrew Zimbalist, Smith College, US This Handbook presents a comprehensive collection of essays by leading scholars and practitioners in the burgeoning field of international sports law. The authors address significant legal issues on two gradually converging tracks: the mainstream institutional framework of the law, primarily the International Olympic Committee, international sports federations, regional and national sports authority, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport; and the commercial sports industry. Topics include the institutional structure; fundamental issues, legal principles and decisions within those institutions; mediation, arbitration and litigation of disputes; doping, gambling and the expanding use of technology in competition; athlete eligibility requirements; discrimination; and protection of athletes. The book also covers a broad range of commercial issues related to competition law and labor markets; media, image, and intellectual property rights; event sponsorships; and players' agents. Comparative analyses of young sports models and practices in North America, Europe and elsewhere supplement the general theme of international sports law. This major collection of essays on some of the most controversial, cutting-edge issues in international sports law, will be a captivating read for academics and students of sports law, sports management, international law and comparative law, as well as practicing lawyers and players agents. Senior executives and other professionals in the sports industry will also find much to interest them in this well-documented Handbook.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780857936301"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0857936301"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 567, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&pg=PA545&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4473.13, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4473.13, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&rdid=book-fnLI-OA0JtgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4473130000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4473130000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Handbook_on_International_Sports_Law-sample-pdf.acsm?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This chapter focuses on the regulation of players&#39; agents in professional <b>football</b> <br>\ngiven that the sector has the highest incidence of agent activity and that <br>\ndevelopments in <b>football</b> drives change in other <b>sports</b>.

This book should be in the library of every institution where students have to write a paper that may be related to sport, or on the shelf of any lecturer teaching economics or public finance who has even a remote interest in sport. The material is very accessible, and useful in many different settings. Ruud H. Koning, Jahrb\u00fccher f. National\u00f6konomie u. Statistik Edward Elgar s brilliant market niche is identifying a topic in economics, finding editors who know the area backwards and challenging them to assemble the best cross-section of relevant articles either already published or newly commissioned. Handbook on the Economics of Sport is Edward Elgar at its very best. If you love economics you ll find many fascinating insights here; if you love sport but know little economics then this book is mostly accessible and will teach you a lot; and if you are a sports-mad economist then you will be in hog heaven. Furthermore, if, like this reviewer, you are broadly very sceptical about the reports consultants produce for governments on the supposed economic windfall from hosting a big event or subsidising a stadium then you will get a lot of good counter-arguments in this volume. Indeed there are several chapters on the above theme that I m sure I ll be copying frequently to government officials in years to come. . . The demand for sport is a fascinating subject and it is hard to pick out just one chapter from the second section. Read them all they make a wonderful 65-page treat. . . Part VI was a real feast, a smorgasbord. . . This is a magnificent piece of work and the 36-page index rounds it all off splendidly. John Blundell, Economic Affairs The book covers the most important areas of research of an emerging economic sub-discipline spanning the past half a century. It serves admirably the purpose of an introduction into the rich and growing area of reflection for all concerned. . . the editors and authors of the Handbook have done a commendable job of accumulating sophisticated material for many economists, managers, politicians and self-conscious fans, who are sure to find excellent training ground for the whole heptathlon. . . This book will be invaluable for advanced students investigating professional sport. From the point of view of lawyers, particularly those engaged with the relationship between law and sports governance, the Handbook offers invaluable analysis of the economic issues that are alluded to in those debates but rarely examined in detail. . . These insights will also prove useful for policy analysts and sports administrators for whom many sections should be considered mandatory reading. Aleksander Sulejewicz, Journal of Contemporary European Research Over 800 pages on the economics of sport. What a feast! What a treat! The editors have done a wonderful job both in terms of breadth from David Beckham to child labour in Pakistan and depth, tournaments and luxury taxes for example. . . The 86 chapters are uniformly of a very high standard and illuminating. And there are real gems in some of the contributions. British Journal on the Economics of Sport This very interesting and comprehensive book achieves its objective, namely to present an overview of research in sports economics at an introductory level. . . [The editors] have produced an excellent reference book that belongs in all academic institutions libraries. It provides extensive introduction to the growing body of literature in the rising field of economics of sport. The book s relevant monographs should be read by institutions, cities and countries prior to their committing major resources towards sports facilities or a sporting event.

The authors consider questions such as the relationship between soccer, the workplace and working class culture; the formation of Brazilian national identity; race relations; political and social movements; and the impact of the sport on social mobility. Contributions to the book range in time from the late nineteenth century, when the British first introduced the sport to Brazil, to the present day, as the 'country of soccer' prepares itself to host the 2014 World Cup, painting a vivid picture of the many ways in which soccer exists and functions in Brazil, both on and off the pitch.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781849045032"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1849045038"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "3.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT44&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1098.45, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 549.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-AEleBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1098450000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 549220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Country_of_Football-sample-epub.acsm?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Country_of_Football-sample-pdf.acsm?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AEleBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "clubs encouraged the professionalism of the <b>sport</b>, a process that peaked in the <br>\n1940s and 1950s.

This revised work, by leading practitioners in the field, with a foreword by Lord Coe, provides a coherent framework for understanding the principles of sports law in this area, as well as a deep analysis of its key features. The subject is split into various areas of practice: first, regulatory rules, which embrace the constitutional aspect of organised sport, including the disciplinary procedures of the various governing organisations; second, broadcasting and marketing resulting from the commercial exploitation, including sponsorship, of sports clubs, sporting events and players; and third, player's rights and obligations, which embraces a wide range of legal issues including club transfers and player contracts, and issues arising from employment (including discrimination law), personal injury and criminal law. Special attention is paid to the impact of EU and Human Rights law as well as to the influential jurisprudence of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. London 2012 provides an appropriate point at which to assess the current state of the law, as well as a look to the future. The target readership extends from solicitors, barristers and legal advisers, to sports organisations and clubs, corporations involved in marketing and sponsorship, media companies, academics teaching sports law, and sports administrators. \u201cI commend it to everyone who has to administer sport as well as to those who have to advise the administrators or argue cases in the field on whatever side.

The people of the ranchos and the barrios have used sport for recreation, leisure, and community bonding. Until now, though, relatively few historians have focused on the sports participation of Latinos, including the numerically preponderant Mexican Americans. This volume gathers an important collection of such studies, arranged in rough chronological order, spanning the period from the late 1920s through the present. They survey and analyze sporting experiences and organizations, as well as their impact on communal and individual lives. Contributions spotlight diverse fields of athletic endeavor: baseball, football, soccer, boxing, track, and softball. Mexican Americans and Sports contributes to the emerging understanding of the value of sport to minority populations in communities throughout the United States. Those interested in sports history will benefit from the book\u2019s focus on under-studied Mexican American participation, and those interested in Mexican American history will welcome the insight into this aspect of the group\u2019s social history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1585445525"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781585445523"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUwhnpNPBfAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUwhnpNPBfAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hUwhnpNPBfAC&pg=PA121&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hUwhnpNPBfAC&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Mexican_Americans_and_Sports.html?hl=&id=hUwhnpNPBfAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Mexican_Americans_and_Sports-sample-epub.acsm?id=hUwhnpNPBfAC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Mexican_Americans_and_Sports-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hUwhnpNPBfAC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hUwhnpNPBfAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "...

It has been at the forefront of sports development and innovation from the earliest days. Neither the opposition of the clergy nor the strictness of the laws could keep all of the Puritans away from the seventeenth century tavern games all of the time. The Boston Book of Sports is a comprehensive survey of sports and recreational activity in and around Boston from 1630 to 1980. In the mid 17th century the local authorities frowned on sports for many reasons including that it gave people pleasure and reduced work efficiency. But the influence of the Mother country, successive waves of immigrants, and many other domestic social/cultural themes changed all that. In the rules and regulations (1642) of Harvard College, the only exercise allowed was to \u201cread the scriptures twice a day.\u201d New England and Puritan asceticism, economic scarcity, and religious devotion combined to overwhelm any possibility of formal sports programs and growth. But the allure of sports is compelling and even in a hostile environment its pleasures were pursued. Toward the end of the 17th century, considerations, circumstances, and attitudes began to change rapidly. Once it changed, sports history was in the making and Boston became the cradle of sports in America. This book is about the people, places, and events of Boston sports history. It indicates the pattern of sports development in Boston from 1630 to the present, recalls the people and events that were important to that development, describes many ways in which that development and the city interacted, and explains why what happened in Boston was important regionally, nationally, and internationally. An acceptance of dancing as a recreation helped make other kinds of pleasure acceptable. As life became less arduous, Sabbath restrictions were relaxed and sports began to be perceived as a method for combating ill health. Harvard College, its students, and its alumni had a major impact on the growth local sports forms, rules, and structures as well as their diffusion to all levels and to other areas. America\u2019s first YMCA was established in Boston in 1851, followed by a YWCA where \u201cworking girls of the city were especially invited.\u201d The YMCA movement itself provided the setting for the creation of the uniquely American sports of basketball and volleyball. The 1852 intercollegiate rowing race between Harvard and Yale marked the formal beginning of sports competitions among educational institutions in this country; football, golf, baseball, yachting and gymnastics as part of the school curriculum all got their start in Boston. This book includes information about the background of boxing, road sports and harness racing in Boston. It recounts the beginning of the Boston Athletic Association, and even describes \u2018sand parks\u2019 which led to the organized play movement in the U.S and later extended to adolescent playgrounds where sports and recreation were taught and encouraged. Boston might well be said to be the cradle of sports in America. It hosted America\u2019s first World Series, its first marathon, its first Davis Cup match. Bicycling, figure skating, golf, squash, lacrosse, field and ice hockey, are just some of the sports popularized and propelled across the country by Boston teams, colleges, and clubs. This comprehensive review brings people, places, and events to life. The chapter headings illustrate the broad range of social and cultural forces that forged the development of sports and later were forged by it as it gained strength and following. Predominant attitudes toward sports are depicted in the chapter headings, which are titled according to historical periods as: \u2022 Sports as Sin: 1630-1710 \u2022 Sports as Recreation and Amusement: 1700-1810 \u2022 Sports of Health and Wealth: 1800-1860 \u2022 Sports of Campus and Clubs: 1850-1895 \u2022 Sports of Parks and Playgrounds: 1885-1920 \u2022 Sports for Amateurs and Spectators : 1910-1945 \u2022 Sport", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781453551363"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1453551360"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 147, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&pg=PA29&dq=Football+Sports&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 750.48, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 375.24, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&rdid=book-Nf2BL6LaMNoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 750480000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 375240000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Boston_Book_of_Sports_From_Puritans-sample-epub.acsm?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Boston_Book_of_Sports_From_Puritans-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Nf2BL6LaMNoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "men to meet to play this version of <b>football</b> in interclass competition.
