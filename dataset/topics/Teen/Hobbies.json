But why do we fill our leisure time with the activities we do? And what do our hobbies say about our culture? Steven Gelber here traces the history and significance of hobbies from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1950s. Although hobbies are often touted as a break from work, Gelber demonstrates that they reflect and reproduce the values and activities of the workplace by bringing utilitarian rationality into the home, imitating the economic stratification of the marketplace, and reinforcing traditional gender roles. Drawing on a wide array of social and cultural theory, Hobbies fills a critical gap in American cultural history and provides a compelling new perspective on the meaning of leisure.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231504233"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231504232"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&pg=PA53&dq=Hobbies&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&dq=Hobbies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Hobbies.html?hl=&id=Cda_QMSGK3sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Hobbies-sample-epub.acsm?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Hobbies-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The product became a commodity when the elderly were told that they could use <br>\ntheir <b>hobbies</b> to earn supplemental income.

What Sher has discovered is that some individuals simply cannot, and should not, decide on a single path; they are genetically wired to pursue many areas. Sher calls them \"Scanners\"--people whose unique type of mind does not zero in on a single interest but rather scans the horizon, eager to explore everything they see.

How much more satisfying would be the work of David Hockney had he made his own easel, palette and oil paints?

Rabbits, a Hobby Farm book. Rabbit breeder and exhibitor Chris McLaughlin offers years of experience and guidance on the many aspects of raising rabbits on a hobby farm, a livestock choice she considers perfect due to the limited space rabbits need to thrive. Whether the reader is raising rabbits for pets, fiber, or meat, there is much solid information and useful advice to be found in the pages of Rabbits. From the natural and cultural history of rabbits to selecting and purchasing of the right rabbits for a small farm, this book is both practical and enlightening. Individual chapters focusing on housing and feeding, behavior and handling, health care, and breeding and raising young make this an indispensable choice for all rabbit keepers. Handsomely designed with color photographs throughout, Rabbits also offers sidebars of helpful tips, fun anecdotes, and quotes from hobby farmers that prove entertaining and edifying. The final chapter of the book, \u201cMaking Money with Rabbits\u201d discusses how to turn the rabbit-raising business profitable through producing show and pet rabbits, wool/fiber rabbits, rabbit manure, and rabbit meat. Resources include a glossary of terms and a catalog of associations, books, periodicals, and websites.

Scott Fitzgerald, first published by Arnold Gingrich of Esquire magazine between January 1940 and May 1941, and later collected in one volume in 1962. The last installments in Esquire of The Pat Hobby Stories were published posthumously; Fitzgerald had died in 1940. Pat Hobby is a down-and-out screenwriter in Hollywood, once successful as \"a good man for structure\" during the silent age of cinema, but now reduced to an alcoholic hack hanging around the studio lot. Most stories find him broke and engaged in some ploy for money or a much-desired screen credit, but his antics usually backfire and end in further humiliation. Drawing on his own experiences as a writer in Hollywood, Fitzgerald portrays Pat Hobby with self-mocking humor and nostalgia.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783736816435"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "373681643X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 149, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT97&dq=Hobbies&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 125.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 125.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-khK8AwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 125070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 125070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Complete_Pat_Hobby_Stories_Illustrat-sample-epub.acsm?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Complete_Pat_Hobby_Stories_Illustrat-sample-pdf.acsm?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=khK8AwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Better than you said.

During World War II, she was asked to build a women's army from scratch\u2014and did. Hobby became Director of the Women's Army Corps and the first Army woman to earn the rank of colonel. President Eisenhower chose her as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, making her the second woman in history to be appointed to a president's cabinet. When she wasn't serving in the government, Hobby worked with her husband, former Texas governor William P. Hobby, to lead a media empire that included the Houston Post newspaper and radio and TV stations. She also supported the Houston community in many ways, from advocating for civil rights for African Americans to donating generously to the Houston Symphony and the Museum of Fine Arts. Oveta Culp Hobby is the first biography of this important woman. Written for middle school readers, it traces her life from her childhood in Killeen to her remarkable achievements in Washington, DC, and Houston. Debra Winegarten provides the background to help young adult readers understand the times in which Hobby lived and the challenges she faced as a woman in nontraditional jobs. She shows how Hobby opened doors for women to serve in the military and in other professions that still benefit women today.

In addition to the improved taste and the appeal of excluding toxic materials, organic farming benefits farmers, their families, and the environment. It offers economic plusses as well. The current consumer demand for \u201clocal\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d food underscores the need for small hobby farms that offer unique high-end goods. Tomolonis explains the basic principles of organic farming and describes how hobby farmers and their families can eat healthier, save money, help preserve the environment, and even turn their passion into a small-scale side business. Chapter 1 will help you assess the land you live on to determine whether it\u2019s suited for organic vegetables, fruit, berries, or livestock. Farmers who are looking to lease or buy land will find practical advice on how to evaluate properties and find their best use, taking climate, soil, water and geography into consideration. In Chapter 2, Tomolonis continues with practical advice on how to choose the right tools without overspending\u2014starting slowly with quality hand implements and then expanding as you determine the need for costlier power equipment. Chapter 3 moves on to the heart of any successful organic farm\u2014building the soil. \u201cThe Good Earth\u201d brings readers down to earth, i.e., the soil. You\u2019ll learn how to evaluate and improve your soil with compost and cover crops and protect it from erosion, chemical contamination and other harm. The author also stresses the importance of understanding the complex relationship between underground soil organisms that play such a crucial role in natural plant health. The best soil, with the right balance of nutrients and a healthy population of microbes, will help your plants survive hardship, resist diseases and produce healthier more bountiful harvests, the author explains. Chapter 4 walks you through the steps needed to develop an organized farm plan. The chapter presents a convenient month-by-month overview of the farmer\u2019s year, offering a timeline and detailed instructions for sowing seeds indoors, transplanting seedlings, guarding against insects and weeds, harvesting, planting cover crops extending the season and developing a schedule for successive food crops. Whether you want to feed your growing family all summer long or produce enough food for a small-scale agribusiness, the information here is invaluable. This chapter also covers organic methods for harnessing the power of nature by luring beneficial insects that will help control farm and garden pests. Learn about heirlooms, hybrids, and eclectic vegetable varieties in the comprehensive directory of vegetable crops and herbs introduced in Chapter 5. Tomolonis reveals his favorite varieties, including many alluring heirlooms that have grown in popularity. Each crop description offers detailed information on soil preparation, sowing, companion planting, and battling weeds and insects without harmful chemicals. The author, a former produce manager for a national grocery chain, also includes tips for harvesting crops, prepping them for display, and bringing the goods to market. If you\u2019re looking for advice on fruits and berries, Organic Hobby Farms introduces new options in Chapter 6, where the author suggests ways to branch out with Asian pears, peaches, and apples, as well as nutritious blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and strawberries. As he does in other chapters, Tomolonis explains in common terms, how to choose the best varieties for your region, prepare the soil for maximum production, and deal with pests and diseases organically. Organic Hobby Farming also describes the basics of adding chickens to your farm\u2014for wholesome organic eggs or pastured meat. Select the right breeds, raise a flock from day-old chicks and protect the birds from predators and pests the natural way. Tomolonis also delves into the fascinating world of apiculture in Chapter 8. He and his wife, Valerie, are avid beekeepers with hives that produce gallons of healthy unpasteurized local honey. In addition to bees, the book provides insight into keeping such small livestock as meat rabbits and dairy goats. Hobby farmers who want to turn their agricultural skills into a money-making operation will find practical advice in Chapter 9, which discusses commercial options. Learn how to sell your goods to local restaurants, at farmers\u2019 markets, or as part of a community-supported-agriculture (CSA) program. And, once you make a decision to turn commercial, you\u2019ll find advice in developing a business plan, crafting a mission statement, setting goals, and creating farm budgets. You\u2019ll also learn the myriad benefits\u2014and challenges\u2014of becoming USDA certified organic. Finally, Organic Hobby Farming steers you to multiple sources of additional information with an extensive listing of resources, broken down by subject and chapter. With Organic Hobby Farming, creative-thinking readers will learn ways to increase the profitability of their organic ventures. The reader can decide to transform his hobby farm into a specialty destination for heirloom varieties, organic raw honey, preserves, dried herbs, or a particularly desirable breed of heritage livestock. As Tomolonis states in the book\u2019s introduction, \u201ceat safer, more nutritious food, learn about your soil and plants, support the local food movement and help save the planet\u2014one acre at a time.\u201d", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781620081259"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1620081253"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT83&dq=Hobbies&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ&dq=Hobbies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Organic_Hobby_Farming.html?hl=&id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Organic_Hobby_Farming-sample-epub.acsm?id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Organic_Hobby_Farming-sample-pdf.acsm?id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=y7MKBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "SJLYUSj_qHMC", "etag": "jyPz/VoBGHM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/SJLYUSj_qHMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Pat Hobby Stories", "authors": ["F.

Sarah seduces Mark at the swimming pool and takes him back to her apartment, seemingly unconcerned that her husband will catch them, and gets more than she bargained for. Tessa finally gets some alone time with her boy friend, unawares that their most intimate romantic moments are being watched - and critiqued! Presley and Ginger become professional escorts and join The Agency but quickly find themselves in hot water and need to figure out how to save themselves without having to sleep with the owner. When Crystal and her best friend Anika join The Agency, Crystal gets sent to Mark for her test drive and needs to quickly decide if she's willing to do whatever it takes to be a success in the Hobby. With successful test drives under their belts, the two ladies become superstars in the Community and decide to treat Mark and Muffin to a special after-dinner game behind closed doors where winner takes all. Waitress Raelene gets the 411 on the Hobby from Anika, who has secretly arranged for her to get test driven by Muffin that very same night. She's a novice but with Anika's help discovers she has the skills to keep Muffin satisfied. Crystal is Mark's all time favorite, but there's one thing that they haven't done. Crystal trusts Mark and is more comfortable with him than she's every been with a man, so she figures, 'Why not?' But will she regret her decision? Here's an (edited) excerpt from the story Test Driving Crystal: \"So I hear that French women are very romantic. Is that true?\" he asks, with an inquiring look in his eye. \"Maybe. It depends on who the guy is. Do you want to find out?\" Despite myself I laugh and feel almost giddy after just one drink from his glass. Any nervousness I had is long gone. Am I really going to get paid for being with a guy that I only just met ten minutes ago? I take the hand he offers me and stand from the sofa. \"Let's go into the bedroom,\" he says and holds my hand as he leads me down the hall. This I can definitely handle, no problemo. I know I'm here for what they call a 'test drive' so maybe he needs a good look at my body, to see if I have any tattoos or piercings or marks? I wonder if these guys complete some kind of written report after we finish? I look around and see that his bedroom is actually quite nice. There's a king-size bed with four huge pillows and a really comfy looking duvet on it, a wooden armoire across from the foot of the bed, a chest of drawers on one side of the bed, near a window that I can see looks out to the swimming pool. On the other side of the bed there's a chair next to a full-length mirror that faces the bed. \"Let me take you glass,\" he offers and sets it next to his half-full glass of Pinot on the night table. I watch as he opens a box of matches and lights the two white candles on the night stand and the three red candles on the chest of drawers. Looks like the bright lights are only temporary. He hasn't told me what to do yet, so I just stand there with my hands at my side and watch him, curious to see what he has in store for me. Whatever it is I'm sure I can take it. I hope. There are about a dozen candles throughout the bedroom, some white and some red, and when he finishes lighting them he sets the matches on the night stand and sits down in the chair next to the mirror. He sees that I am there standing at attention, waiting for direction, and he smiles. \"Go stand over there, Crystal,\" he points to the foot of the bed, about four feet from where he is sitting. I do as he instructs and stand obediently with my arms straight and relaxed and my hands folded in front of me. It's weird, but I actually like it!", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1514896818"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781514896815"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 152, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uYsdswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uYsdswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uYsdswEACAAJ&dq=Hobbies&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uYsdswEACAAJ&dq=Hobbies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/My_Secret_Hobby.html?hl=&id=uYsdswEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uYsdswEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is a collection of all five books in the My Secret Hobby series consisting of: Something Special, Test Driving Crystal, Dinner For Four, Recruiting Raelene, and Are We Going To Do That?"}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "hLeHDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "8Nm0vgAEuW0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hLeHDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "In Miniature", "subtitle": "How Small Things Illuminate the World", "authors": ["Simon Garfield"], "publisher": "Atria Books", "publishedDate": "2019-03-12", "description": "Bestselling, award-winning writer Simon Garfield returns with an enthralling investigation of humans\u2019 peculiar fascination with small things\u2014and what small things tell us about our larger world. \u201c[Simon Garfield is] an exuberant truffle-hound of the recondite and delightful factoid.\u201d \u2014Sunday Times (London) Simon Garfield writes books that shine a light on aspects of the everyday world in order to reveal the charms and eccentricities hiding in plain sight around us. After beguiling fans with books about everything from typography to time, from historic maps to the color mauve, he\u2019s found his most delightful topic yet: miniatures. Tiny Eiffel Towers. Platoons of brave toy soldiers. A doll\u2019s house created for a Queen. Diminutive crime scenes crafted to catch a killer. Model villages and miniscule railways. These are just a few of the objects you will discover in the pages of In Miniature. Bringing together history, psychology, art, and obsession, Garfield explores what fuels the strong appeal of miniature objects among collectors, modelers, and fans. The toys we enjoy as children invest us with a rare power at a young age, conferring on us a taste of adult-sized authority. For some, the desire to play with small things becomes a desire to make small things. We live in a vast and uncertain world, and controlling just a tiny, scaled-down part of it restores our sense of order and worth. As it explores flea circuses, microscopic food, ancient tombs, and the Vegas Strip, In Miniature changes the way we perceive our surroundings, encouraging all of us to find greatness in the smallest of things.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781501199585"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1501199587"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hLeHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hLeHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hLeHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hobbies&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hLeHDwAAQBAJ&dq=Hobbies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/In_Miniature.html?hl=&id=hLeHDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hLeHDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A doll\u2019s house created for a Queen.
