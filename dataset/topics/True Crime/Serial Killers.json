Shon and Dragan Milovanovic, is a collection of ten chapters on the nature, expression, development, and possible responses to this recently popularized form of crime. These forms of serial killings not only involve continuous killings but some form of perverse sexual relations with the victim or body of the victim. Perhaps brought to public attention by some dramatic cases involving Jeffrey Dahmer, Robert Bundy, John Gacy, and Denis Rader and popular media presentations such as The Silence of the Lambs (1991), the examination of this phenomenon is only recently entering more scholarly scrutiny. This book includes various notable scholars in the field, from theoreticians to practitioners, and is divided into three parts. The first part develops theories of sexual homicide and the development of predatory laws. It examines the history of serial lust homicide, definitions, and motivational models. It also includes attempts at integrative approaches. The second part develops such forms of lust serial killing as piquerism, paraphilia, and necrophilia. The third part concerns the effects of the media, as well as phenomenological, existential, and ''edge work'' oriented approaches. Serial Killers not only brings the phenomenon under a keen theoretical and empirical investigation, shedding more scholarly insights on the phenomena, but it suggests methods for developing research hypotheses for academicians and for presenting practitioners with further insights into the field.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015066785240"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 227, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-pLaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-pLaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-pLaAAAAMAAJ&q=Serial+Killers&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-pLaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Serial_Killers.html?hl=&id=-pLaAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-pLaAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book includes various notable scholars in the field, from theoreticians to practitioners, and is divided into three parts.

Analysis Of Criminal Minds, Patterns, Thinking, Reasons Why They Did What They Did! It is not in the natural wiring of a man (or woman) to take another man's life. It is even more unnatural when the person has a compulsion to keep taking lives, so that he satisfies some twisted craving. The psychology of serial killers is a bit difficult to explore. The reason is that it is not something that is set in rigid boundaries. It appears that after every murder, an extra layer is added to it. It also appears that the humane side of a serial killer dies a little more with every killing.Do you want to learn more about serial killers? Are you interested in knowing what led them down that path? If you do, this book does a great job of looking at what drove the different people to serial killers. It is important to note that nothing justifies taking life but rather we try to look at what made sense in the eyes of the serial killer to do what they did and with no remorse for their actions.

Daniel Camargo sought out virgins, and took both their virtues and their lives. Luis Garavito became sadistically violent after years of sexual abuse. In Colombia in the 1970s, '80s and '90s, these three monsters cut a swath of terror across a country already ravaged by poverty as well as the casualties of the region's powerful drug cartels. The three are among the most prolific serial killers in the world, and incredibly are believed to be responsible for nearly 1,000 murders of young boys and girls whose positions on the lower rungs of society's ladder made them especially vulnerable. These true accounts of Colombia's most sadistic of sex criminals reveal the awful price they forced the most innocent of victims to pay when their childhood betrayals turned to uncontrollable rage. These chilling true crime stories are the stuff of nightmares, and if you're not left shattered by the sheer number of victims - you'll reel when you learn how little time these madmen served for destroying the lives of so many families already struggling with hardship. It's a serial killer biography that will not only leave you stunned, but also wondering if the infamous Pedro Lopez - released after serving less than 30 years - is still alive somewhere, holding macabre tea parties with his young victims.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1533070709"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781533070708"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 142, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HnTMDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HnTMDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HnTMDAEACAAJ&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HnTMDAEACAAJ&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Serial_Killers.html?hl=&id=HnTMDAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HnTMDAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The three are among the most prolific serial killers in the world, and incredibly are believed to be responsible for nearly 1,000 murders of young boys and girls whose positions on the lower rungs of society&#39;s ladder made them especially ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "epE0swEACAAJ", "etag": "87H/nXB8amM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/epE0swEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Serial Killers Adult Coloring Book", "authors": ["K.

In addition to this, American popular culture personifies serial killers as modern-day monsters. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the media's perception of the serial killer through popular forms of narration: the film and the drama-documentary.

John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as \"a force of pure evil,\" Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried \"kill kits\"--cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools--in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter. When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years--uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake--many of which remain unsolved to this day. American Predator is the ambitious culmination of years of interviews with key figures in law enforcement and in Keyes's life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and to the limitations of traditional law enforcement.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780698191068"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0698191064"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=53&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 872.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 436.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2uV8DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 872160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 436080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/American_Predator-sample-epub.acsm?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years--uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "wgyXDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "ZaL0W8rkHB0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wgyXDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Murder in California: Serial Killers and Famous Unsolved Murders", "subtitle": "The Topography of Evil: Notorious California Murder Sites", "authors": ["Marques Vickers"], "publisher": "Marquis Publishing", "publishedDate": "2019-05-09", "description": "\u201cMurder in California\u201d profiles some of California\u2019s most infamous serial killers and unsolved murder cases.

The images and profiles offer a descriptive account, detailed location, and trial aftermath providing an important understanding into the further reaching effects of each crime. Convicted killers and their confirmed victims are identified. For criminals still living, their current incarceration location is provided.

Serial Killers and the Phenomenon of Serial Murder examines and analyses some of the best known (as well as lesser) cases from English criminal history, ancient and modern. It looks at the lifestyles, backgrounds and activities of those who become serial killers and identifies clear categories of individuals into which most serial killers fall. Led by Professor David Wilson the authors are all experts and teachers concerning the ever-intriguing subject of serial killing: why, when and how it happens and whether it can be predicted. Taking some of the leading cases from English law and abroad they demonstrate the patterns that emerge in the lives and backgrounds of those who kill a number of times over a period. The book is designed for those studying the topic at advanced level, whether as an academic discipline on one of the many courses now run by universities and colleges or as a private quest for understanding. It contains notes on key terms and explanations of topics such as co-activation, Munchausen syndrome, cooling-off period, psychopathy checklist, social construction, case linkage, family annihilation, activity space, rational choice theory, medicalisation and rendezvous discipline.

Over 40 hours of conversation, Samuel Little confessed killing after killing to Jillian Lauren. He told her of the marginalised and drug-addicted women he strangled to death. He sent her memorial \u2018art\u2019 of his victims. He talked and talked and talked. And when he finished talking, she realised she had been speaking to one of the most prolific serial killers of all time.

On July 15, 1997, Gianni Versace was shot and killed on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan. But months before Versace\u2019s murder, award-winning journalist Maureen Orth was already investigating a major story on Cunanan for Vanity Fair. Culled from interviews with more than four hundred people and insights gleaned from thousands of pages of police reports, Vulgar Favors tells the complete story of Andrew Cunanan, his unwitting victims, and the moneyed world in which they lived . . . and died. Orth reveals how Cunanan met Versace, and why police and the FBI repeatedly failed to catch him. Here is a gripping odyssey that races across America\u2014from California\u2019s wealthy gay underworld to modest Midwestern homes of families mourning the loss of their sons to South Beach and its unapologetic decadence. Vulgar Favors is at once a masterwork of investigative journalism and a riveting account of a sociopath, his crimes, and the mysteries he left along the way. \u201cThe breadth and thoroughness of [Maureen] Orth\u2019s research are often staggering.\u201d\u2014The New York Times \u201cFascinating . . . ripe with chilling detail.\u201d\u2014Entertainment Weekly", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307766616"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307766618"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 560, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.8.8.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Vulgar_Favors.html?hl=&id=_jGKtjtLRPoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vulgar_Favors-sample-epub.acsm?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vulgar_Favors-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Here is a gripping odyssey that races across America\u2014from California\u2019s wealthy gay underworld to modest Midwestern homes of families mourning the loss of their sons to South Beach and its unapologetic decadence."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "da_fY9EfydsC", "etag": "i/swu7/v8vA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/da_fY9EfydsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Serial Killer Files", "subtitle": "The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World's Most Terrifying Murderers", "authors": ["Harold Schechter"], "publisher": "Ballantine Books", "publishedDate": "2003-12-30", "description": "THE DEFINITIVE DOSSIER ON HISTORY\u2019S MOST HEINOUS!

Rigorously researched and packed with the most terrifying, up-to-date information, this innovative and highly compelling compendium covers every aspect of multiple murderers\u2013from psychology to cinema, fetishism to fan clubs, \u201ctrophies\u201d to trading cards. Discover: WHO THEY ARE: Those featured include Ed Gein, the homicidal mama\u2019s boy who inspired fiction\u2019s most famous Psycho, Norman Bates; Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi, sex-crazed killer cousins better known as the Hillside Stranglers; and the Beanes, a fifteenth-century cave-dwelling clan with an insatiable appetite for human flesh HOW THEY KILL: They shoot, stab, and strangle. Butcher, bludgeon, and burn. Drown, dismember, and devour . . . and other methods of massacre too many and monstrous to mention here. WHY THEY DO IT: For pleasure and for profit. For celebrity and for \u201ccompanionship.\u201d For the devil and for dinner. For the thrill of it, for the hell of it, and because \u201csuch men are monsters, who live . . . beyond the frontiers of madness.\u201d PLUS: in-depth case studies, classic killers\u2019 nicknames, definitions of every kind of deviance and derangement, and much, much more. For more than one hundred profiles of lethal loners and killer couples, Bluebeards and black widows, cannibals and copycats\u2013 this is an indispensable, spine-tingling, eye-popping investigation into the dark hearts and mad minds of that twisted breed of human whose crimes are the most frightening . . . and fascinating.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0345472004"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780345472007"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.7.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=da_fY9EfydsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=da_fY9EfydsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=da_fY9EfydsC&pg=PA89&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=da_fY9EfydsC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=da_fY9EfydsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 945.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 472.58, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=da_fY9EfydsC&rdid=book-da_fY9EfydsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 945160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 472580000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Serial_Killer_Files-sample-epub.acsm?id=da_fY9EfydsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Serial_Killer_Files-sample-pdf.acsm?id=da_fY9EfydsC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=da_fY9EfydsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World&#39;s Most Terrifying Murderers <br>\nHarold Schechter ... =2~~~~~ WORK AND PLAY According to the FBI, a <b>serial</b> <br>\n<b>killer</b> is anyone who murders three or more victims with a significant interval of <br>\ntime&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rcSIDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "T9qgX6UcuPk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rcSIDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Serial Killers: The World's Most Evil", "authors": ["Nigel Blundell"], "publisher": "Grub Street Publishers", "publishedDate": "2010-11-10", "description": "One hundred years of the most depraved criminal minds\u2014from H.

The author, a Lacanian psychoanalyst and senior psychiatrist in France, with extensive experience working in institutional settings, analyses the logic informing the crimes of famous serial killers. Addressing the Landru case (which was the inspiration for Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux), as well as those of Pierre Rivi\u00e8re and Donato Bilancia, Biagi-Chai casts light on the confusion that pervades forensic psychiatry and criminal law as to the distinction between mental illness and \u2018madness\u2019. She then elaborates the consequences of her argument in a sustained critique of the insanity defence. The book includes a Foreword by the renowned psychoanalyst, Jacques-Alain Miller, and an introduction by the translators on the question of insanity before the law in the US and in the UK, which considers the pertinence of Biagi-Chai\u2019s argument for forensic psychiatry, for criminal law, and for the increasing contemporary focus on the assessment of dangerousness and risk-management strategies in crime control practices.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781136645396"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "113664539X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT20&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=76&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-h2apAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Serial_Killers-sample-epub.acsm?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Serial_Killers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The Criminal Responsibility of <b>Serial Killers Serial Killers</b>: Psychiatry, <br>\nCriminology, Responsibility also addresses thelegalissues at stake in findings of <br>\ncriminal responsibility.

The coverage of real-life murderers such as Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer has transformed them into ghoulish celebrities. Similarly, the popularity of fictional characters such as Hannibal \u201cThe Cannibal\u201d Lecter or Dexter demonstrates just how eager the public is to be frightened by these human predators. But why is this so? Could it be that some of us have a gruesome fascination with serial killers for the same reasons we might morbidly stare at a catastrophic automobile accident? Or it is something more? In Why We Love Serial Killers, criminology professor Dr. Scott Bonn explores our powerful appetite for the macabre, while also providing new and unique insights into the world of the serial killer, including those he has gained from his correspondence with two of the world\u2019s most notorious examples, David Berkowitz (\u201cSon of Sam\u201d) and Dennis Rader (\u201cBind, Torture, Kill\u201d). In addition, Bonn examines the criminal profiling techniques used by law enforcement professionals to identify and apprehend serial predators, he discusses the various behaviors\u2014such as the charisma of the sociopath\u2014 that manifest themselves in serial killers, and he explains how and why these killers often become popular cultural figures.

The coverage of real-life murderers such as Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer has transformed them into ghoulish celebrities. Similarly, the popularity of fictional characters such as Hannibal \u201cThe Cannibal\u201d Lecter or Dexter demonstrates just how eager the public is to be frightened by these human predators. But why is this so? Could it be that some of us have a gruesome fascination with serial killers for the same reasons we might morbidly stare at a catastrophic automobile accident? Or it is something more? In Why We Love Serial Killers, criminology professor Dr. Scott Bonn explores our powerful appetite for the macabre, while also providing new and unique insights into the world of the serial killer, including those he has gained from his correspondence with two of the world\u2019s most notorious examples, David Berkowitz (\u201cSon of Sam\u201d) and Dennis Rader (\u201cBind, Torture, Kill\u201d). In addition, Bonn examines the criminal profiling techniques used by law enforcement professionals to identify and apprehend serial predators, he discusses the various behaviors\u2014such as the charisma of the sociopath\u2014 that manifest themselves in serial killers, and he explains how and why these killers often become popular cultural figures. Groundbreaking in its approach, Why We Love Serial Killers is a compelling look at how the media, law enforcement agencies, and public perception itself shapes and feeds the \u201cmonsters\u201d in our midst.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781632201898"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1632201895"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 264, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=80&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 802.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 401.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WUJgBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 802400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 401200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Why_We_Love_Serial_Killers-sample-epub.acsm?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Why_We_Love_Serial_Killers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>serial killers</b> are transformed into larger-than-life celebrity monsters through the <br>\ncombined efforts of law enforcement authorities, the news and entertainment <br>\nmedia, and the public.

On July 15, 1997, Gianni Versace was shot and killed on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan. But months before Versace\u2019s murder, award-winning journalist Maureen Orth was already investigating a major story on Cunanan for Vanity Fair. Culled from interviews with more than four hundred people and insights gleaned from thousands of pages of police reports, Vulgar Favors tells the complete story of Andrew Cunanan, his unwitting victims, and the moneyed world in which they lived . . . and died. Orth reveals how Cunanan met Versace, and why police and the FBI repeatedly failed to catch him. Here is a gripping odyssey that races across America\u2014from California\u2019s wealthy gay underworld to modest Midwestern homes of families mourning the loss of their sons to South Beach and its unapologetic decadence. Vulgar Favors is at once a masterwork of investigative journalism and a riveting account of a sociopath, his crimes, and the mysteries he left along the way. \u201cThe breadth and thoroughness of [Maureen] Orth\u2019s research are often staggering.\u201d\u2014The New York Times \u201cFascinating . . . ripe with chilling detail.\u201d\u2014Entertainment Weekly", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307766616"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307766618"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 560, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.8.8.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Vulgar_Favors.html?hl=&id=_jGKtjtLRPoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vulgar_Favors-sample-epub.acsm?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vulgar_Favors-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Here is a gripping odyssey that races across America\u2014from California\u2019s wealthy gay underworld to modest Midwestern homes of families mourning the loss of their sons to South Beach and its unapologetic decadence."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "da_fY9EfydsC", "etag": "YrZgqaRdhUA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/da_fY9EfydsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Serial Killer Files", "subtitle": "The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World's Most Terrifying Murderers", "authors": ["Harold Schechter"], "publisher": "Ballantine Books", "publishedDate": "2003-12-30", "description": "THE DEFINITIVE DOSSIER ON HISTORY\u2019S MOST HEINOUS!

The author, a Lacanian psychoanalyst and senior psychiatrist in France, with extensive experience working in institutional settings, analyses the logic informing the crimes of famous serial killers. Addressing the Landru case (which was the inspiration for Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux), as well as those of Pierre Rivi\u00e8re and Donato Bilancia, Biagi-Chai casts light on the confusion that pervades forensic psychiatry and criminal law as to the distinction between mental illness and \u2018madness\u2019. She then elaborates the consequences of her argument in a sustained critique of the insanity defence. The book includes a Foreword by the renowned psychoanalyst, Jacques-Alain Miller, and an introduction by the translators on the question of insanity before the law in the US and in the UK, which considers the pertinence of Biagi-Chai\u2019s argument for forensic psychiatry, for criminal law, and for the increasing contemporary focus on the assessment of dangerousness and risk-management strategies in crime control practices.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781136645396"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "113664539X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT20&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-h2apAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Serial_Killers-sample-epub.acsm?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Serial_Killers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=h2apAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The Criminal Responsibility of <b>Serial Killers Serial Killers</b>: Psychiatry, <br>\nCriminology, Responsibility also addresses thelegalissues at stake in findings of <br>\ncriminal responsibility.

They have become pop culture figures, famous for their crimes and the violent nature of their acts. People feel compelled to understand more about these dark and twisted crimes, even when they disgust. For audiences everywhere, the very idea that these people can exist and operate in day-to-day life becomes an issue of abject terror and interest. That your neighbor, your boss, or your gas station attendant might be in the midst of a killing spree taps into something primal and very hard to imagine. It reflects the darkest side of the human psyche. \"Serial Killer\" as a term can be difficult to define. Different criminal investigation units typically require two, three, or more attributable killings over a period of time before an individual can be considered to have joined the ranks of the serial killers. However, it is not really the numbers which can interest so many people and scare others. Instead, it is the often random nature of the killings. Rather than crimes of passion, crimes of financial reward, or instances when an individual has reached their end of their emotional tether, the crimes of serial killers have often been planned days, weeks, or months in advance. Targets can be random, but the killings are often planned in great detail. From cannibalism to mental health concerns, from ritualistic witchcraft to a simple interest in violence, learning what motivates these people can offer both insight and further confusion.The cases presented in this book are extreme cases and display to what extent a serial killer can go...Read the stories of little known serial killers that went beyond the limit of our imagination to perpetrate vile unremorseful murders in the blink of an eye.

Although there are genes in our body which can determine our height, the color of our hair, and the complexion of our skin, there isn't one that can predispose a person's criminality. A lot of people say that background and upbringing play a huge role - and experts tend to agree. For instance, Henry Lee Lucas' crime was said to be because of his monster of a mother. However, people with good upbringings can also turn into serial killers, such as Jesse Pomeroy, whose parents were well employed and were in a healthy, loving relationship. It's confusing to say the least; the number of factors can't be confined to background and upbringing - there are also the issues of mental illness, lack of education, hatred towards a certain group of people, and distortion of what they believe, as was the case with Robin Gecht who used Satan as his reason to amputate human breasts. One can fear a person and be more cautious when around him or her because that individual gives off \"bad vibes,\" but no one can be truly sure whether he was a killer or not- until the time he was caught.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1533003343"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781533003348"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 80, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UkmmDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UkmmDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UkmmDAEACAAJ&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UkmmDAEACAAJ&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Serial_Killers_True_Crime.html?hl=&id=UkmmDAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UkmmDAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Homicidal Maniacs, Bloodthirsty Serial Killers And Lethal Murderers: True Crime Stories Of Crazed Killers Criminality is a cornucopia of irony."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oHc3tAEACAAJ", "etag": "GdkkXLs2CAc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oHc3tAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Serial Killers", "subtitle": "The Worlds Most Notorious and Ferocious Serial Killers; an in Depth Analysis of Serial Killers Minds", "authors": ["Brody Clayton"], "publisher": "Createspace Independent Publishing Platform", "publishedDate": "2017-05-06", "description": "Volume 2 of The Worlds Most Notorious And Ferocious Serial Killers: An In Depth Analysis Of Serial Killers Minds Get Your FREE BONUSES When You Grab This Book!

What can be so wrong with them that their emotions conflict to such an extent with the rest of the population? Is it a disease, an illness or just a complicated childhood?

Of course, there are some serial killers who fit into these categories, but the married Green River Killer was not a dysfunctional loner; there are plenty of female and non-Caucasian serial killers; Dr Harold Shipman was certainly not motivated by sex; many serial killings (such as the Ipswich prostitute murders carried out by Steve Wright) happen within a confined area; the 'BTK Killer', Dennis Rader, stopped killing in 1991, but wasn't caught until fourteen years later. Many serial killers may have a low animal cunning, or be 'street smart', but few of them are Mensa-level geniuses. Each of the thirty cases covered here is unusual in some respect, perhaps in the way in which the killer carried out their crimes, the choice of victims, the way in which they were apprehended, or the method of their execution. The cases are presented alphabetically by country - from Australia via Colombia, Great Britain, Indonesia, Iran, South Africa and elsewhere to the United States - and then chronologically. They come from across history and from all over the world. The author has gone back as far as possible to contemporary source material - newspaper accounts, trial evidence, interviews with perpetrators or survivors - rather than rely on the increasingly blurred truth to be found online and in far too many collections.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472136732"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "147213673X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=103&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 595.9, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 297.95, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 595900000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 297950000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Serial_Killer_Files-sample-epub.acsm?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Wu1oDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Each of the thirty cases covered here is unusual in some respect, perhaps in the way in which the killer carried out their crimes, the choice of victims, the way in which they were apprehended, or the method of their execution."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DS6OzQEACAAJ", "etag": "LRPlTXeT21I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DS6OzQEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Serial Killers Secrets Life of Before Being Serial Killer Adult Coloring Book", "subtitle": "175 Pages an Adult Coloring Book Printed on 8x10'' Inch Poster Glossy Paper", "authors": ["A.

In addition to the significant investigative challenges they bring to law enforcement, serial murder cases attract an over-abundance of attention from the media, mental health experts, academia, and the general public. While there has been significant, independent work conducted by a variety of experts to identify and analyse the many issues related to serial murder, there have been few efforts to reach a consensus between law enforcement and other experts, regarding these matters. This book is based on information from who have successfully investigated and apprehended serial killers; mental health, academic, and other experts who have studied serial killers and shared their expertise through education and publication; officers of the court, who have judged, prosecuted, and defended serial killers; and members of the media, who inform and educate the public when serial killers strike. A variety of topics covered are related to serial murder including common myths, definitions, typologies, pathology and causality, forensics, the role of the media, prosecution issues, investigative task force organisation, and major case management issues. This book is a culmination of the input and discussion on the major issues related to serial murder. The goal in publishing this book is to outline the consensus views from a variety of disciplines on the causality, motivations, and characteristics of serial murderers, which will enable the criminal justice community to generate a more effective response in the identification, investigation, and adjudication of these cases.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1606922041"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781606922040"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 92, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t8AkOgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t8AkOgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t8AkOgAACAAJ&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t8AkOgAACAAJ&dq=Serial+Killers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Serial_Murderers.html?hl=&id=t8AkOgAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t8AkOgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The goal in publishing this book is to outline the consensus views from a variety of disciplines on the causality, motivations, and characteristics of serial murderers, which will enable the criminal justice community to generate a more ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AtBbCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "ZLXxI9/ZOjY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AtBbCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Jane Steele", "authors": ["Lyndsay Faye"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2016-03-22", "description": "'Reader, I murdered him.' JANE STEELE is a brilliant Gothic retelling of JANE EYRE from Edgar-nominated Lyndsay Faye, for fans of LONGBOURN and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES. 'I loved it' - Elly Griffiths. ** JANE STEELE HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN EDGAR AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL 2017 ** Like the heroine of the novel she adores, Jane Steele suffers cruelly at the hands of her aunt and schoolmaster. And like Jane Eyre, they call her wicked - but in her case, she fears the accusation is true. When she flees, she leaves behind the corpses of her tormentors. A fugitive navigating London's underbelly, Jane rights wrongs on behalf of the have-nots whilst avoiding the noose. Until an advertisement catches her eye.

The architect was Daniel H. Burnham, the driving force behind the White City, the massive, visionary landscape of white buildings set in a wonderland of canals and gardens. The killer was H. H. Holmes, a handsome doctor with striking blue eyes. He used the attraction of the great fair - and his own devilish charms - to lure scores of young women to their deaths. While Burnham overcame politics, infighting, personality clashes and Chicago's infamous weather to transform the swamps of Jackson Park into the greatest show on Earth, Holmes built his own edifice just west of the fairground. He called it the World's Fair Hotel. In reality it was a torture palace, a gas chamber, a crematorium.

H. Holmes as America's first serial killer. He truly was a diabolical and evil individual. The intention of writing this book is not to declare anyone as America's first serial killer, but rather to reveal that serial killers existed very early in America's growth. America's Early Serial Killers contains in vivid detail the murderous activities of five serial killers starting back in the 1790s and continuing through to the 1890s. In one case, the killer has never been identified. Given that these cases occurred so long ago, there will certainly be differing accounts as to what happened and who did what. The research was as thorough as possible though the conclusions may differ from other resources. The serial killers included in this book used different tactics and methods than current day serial killers though the atrocities were as bad if not worse. Included are the cases of: -The Harpe Brothers who slaughtered up to forty people, including some of their own children -Felipe Espinosa who murdered many settlers in the Colorado territory -The Murderous Bender Family who killed travellers for their money -The still unsolved Servant Girl Murders of Austin, Texas, and finally -The story of H. H. Holmes himself. If you enjoy reading about true crime thats a bit unusual, this book will certainly satisfy and at the same time also reveal some facets of early American life.
