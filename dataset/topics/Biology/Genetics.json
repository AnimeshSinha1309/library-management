The first paper on this single-cell gel electrophoresis assay was published in 1984 by O. Ostling and K.J. Johanson (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. Vol.123: 291-298). The comet assay is a versatile and sensitive method for measuring single - and double-strand breaks in DNA. By including lesion-specific enzymes in the assay, its range and sensitivity are greatly increased, but it is important to bear in mind that their specificity is not absolute. The comet assay (with and without inclusion of lesion-specific enzymes) is widely used as a biomarker assay in human population studies - primarily to measure DNA damage, but increasingly also to assess the capacity of cells for DNA repair. Ostling and Johanson (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1984) were also the first to report experiments to measure DNA repair, by simply following the decrease of DNA damage over time after challenging cells with ionising radiation. However, this approach is time-consuming and laborious as it requires an extended period of cell culture and is therefore not ideal for biomonitoring studies, which typically require high-throughput processing of many samples. As an alternative approach, the in vitro comet-based repair assay was developed: a cell extract is incubated with a DNA substrate containing specific lesions, and DNA incisions accumulate. The in vitro comet-based repair assay has been modified and improved over the past decade: it was first devised to measure base excision repair of oxidised purines in lymphocytes (Collins et al., Mutagenesis, 2001), but has since been adapted for other lesions and thus other repair pathways, as well as being applied to tissue samples in addition to cell suspensions. Even after 30 years, the comet assay is still in a growth phase, with many new users each year. Many questions are repeatedly raised, which may seem to have self-evident answers, but clearly, it is necessary to reiterate them for the benefit of the new audience, and sometimes being forced to think again about old topics can shed new light. Different applications of the comet assay are discussed in this special issue, including: genotoxicity testing in different organisms, human biomonitoring, DNA repair studies, environmental biomonitoring and clinical studies. Furthermore, we consider and where possible answer questions, including the ones raised by Raymond Tice at the 8th International Comet Assay Workshop in Perugia (Italy 2009): What is the spectrum of DNA damage detected by the various versions of the comet assay?; What are the limitations associated with each application?; What should be done to standardize the assay for biomonitoring studies?; Can the comet assay be used to monitor changes in global methylation status?; What cell types are suitable for detecting genotoxic substances and their effects in vivo and in vitro?; Can the assay be fully automated?; and more. So this \u2018Frontiers in Genetics\u2019 research topic is written for the beginner as well as for the experienced users of the comet assay.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889196494"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889196496"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/30_years_of_the_Comet_Assay_an_overview.html?hl=&id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kKr3rKhPU7oC", "etag": "o+AMPuWCaoE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kKr3rKhPU7oC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Extending the Scalability of Linkage Learning Genetic Algorithms", "subtitle": "Theory & Practice", "authors": ["Ying-ping Chen"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "Genetic algorithms (GAs) are powerful search techniques based on principles of evolution and widely applied to solve problems in many disciplines. However, most GAs employed in practice nowadays are unable to learn genetic linkage and suffer from the linkage problem. The linkage learning genetic algorithm (LLGA) was proposed to tackle the linkage problem with several specially designed mechanisms. While the LLGA performs much better on badly scaled problems than simple GAs, it does not work well on uniformly scaled problems as other competent GAs. Therefore, we need to understand why it is so and need to know how to design a better LLGA or whether there are certain limits of such a linkage learning process. This book aims to gain better understanding of the LLGA in theory and to improve the LLGA's performance in practice. It starts with a survey of the existing genetic linkage learning techniques and describes the steps and approaches taken to tackle the research topics, including using promoters, developing the convergence time model, and adopting subchromosomes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540284591"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540284598"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 120, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea.html?hl=&id=kKr3rKhPU7oC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea-sample-epub.acsm?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea-sample-pdf.acsm?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "yXFfPkLq4yEC", "etag": "xVua+kmL5xE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yXFfPkLq4yEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lewin's GENES XI", "authors": ["Jocelyn E.

It mainly assists in modeling, predicting and interpreting large multidimensional biological data by utilizing advanced computational methods. Despite its enormous potential, bioinformatics is not widely integrated into the academic curriculum as most life science students and researchers are still not equipped with the necessary knowledge to take advantage of this powerful tool. Hence, the primary purpose of our book is to supplement this unmet need by providing an easily accessible platform for students and researchers starting their career in life sciences. This book aims to avoid sophisticated computational algorithms and programming. Instead, it mostly focuses on simple DIY analysis and interpretation of biological data with personal computers. Our belief is that once the beginners acquire these basic skillsets, they will be able to handle most of the bioinformatics tools for their research work and to better understand their experimental outcomes. Unlike other bioinformatics books which are mostly theoretical, this book provides practical examples for the readers on state-of-the-art open source tools to solve biological problems.

Beginning in 1953, life too became textual. The discovery of the structure of DNA made it possible to represent the basic matter of life with permutations and combinations of four letters of the alphabet, A, T, C, and G. Since then, the biological and legal conceptions of life have been in constant, mutually constitutive interplay--the former focusing on life's definition, the latter on life's entitlements. Reframing Rights argues that this period of transformative change in law and the life sciences should be considered \"bioconstitutional.\"Reframing Rights explores the evolving relationship of biology, biotechnology, and law through a series of national and cross-national case studies. Sheila Jasanoff maps out the conceptual territory in a substantive editorial introduction, after which the contributors offer \"snapshots\" of developments at the frontiers of biotechnology and the law. Chapters examine such topics as national cloning and xenotransplant policies; the politics of stem cell research in Britain, Germany, and Italy; DNA profiling and DNA databases in criminal law; clinical trials in India and the United States; the GM crop controversy in Britain; and precautionary policymaking in the European Union. These cases demonstrate changes of constitutional significance in the relations among human bodies, selves, science, and the state.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262015950"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262015951"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 310, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F8dLsppNtQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F8dLsppNtQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F8dLsppNtQwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F8dLsppNtQwC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Reframing_Rights.html?hl=&id=F8dLsppNtQwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Reframing_Rights-sample-epub.acsm?id=F8dLsppNtQwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Reframing_Rights-sample-pdf.acsm?id=F8dLsppNtQwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=F8dLsppNtQwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AUxd_e4mzHIC", "etag": "oguoBKT57z8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AUxd_e4mzHIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Caenorhabditis Elegans", "subtitle": "Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism", "authors": ["Henry F.

Four primary sections--Genetic and Culture Methods, Neurobiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and Genomics and Informatics--reflect the cross-disciplinary nature of C. elegans research. Because C. elegans is a simple and malleable organism with a small genome and few cell types, it provides an elegant demonstration of functions fundamental to multicellular organisms. The discipline has greatly expanded as researchers continue to find this small soil nematode to be the model of choice for studying specific pathways, stages of development, and cell types. By directing its audience not just to tried-and-true recipes for research, but also to databases and other innovative sources of information, this comprehensive collection is intended to guide investigators of C. elegans for years to come. First single-source book detailing explanations of current and classic C. elegans methodologies Diversity and scope of techniques covered expected to be useful to the broadening community of C. elegans researchers for years to come Techniques range from reverse genetics and mutagenesis, to laser ablation and electrophysiology, to in situ hybridization and DNA sequencing methods Appendices include resource information important to the C. elegans community, including the C. elegans Genetics Center and Internet resources like the Worm Community System and ACeDB Illustrated with more than 100 tables and figures", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780125641494"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0125641494"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 659, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.4.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Caenorhabditis_Elegans.html?hl=&id=AUxd_e4mzHIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Caenorhabditis_Elegans-sample-pdf.acsm?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EDViIysU0uEC", "etag": "M6jCG7+e8Tg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EDViIysU0uEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Extended Phenotype", "subtitle": "The Long Reach of the Gene", "authors": ["Richard Dawkins", "Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science Richard Dawkins", "Daniel Clement Dennett"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "publishedDate": "1999", "description": "In this influential and controversial book that has become a classic in popular science writing, Dawkins furthers his fascinating look at the evolution of life and natural selection.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0192880519"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780192880512"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 313, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EDViIysU0uEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EDViIysU0uEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EDViIysU0uEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EDViIysU0uEC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Extended_Phenotype.html?hl=&id=EDViIysU0uEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EDViIysU0uEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "X1Gqw68gcpIC", "etag": "vF94vVDprsQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/X1Gqw68gcpIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Quantitative Trait Loci", "subtitle": "Methods and Protocols", "authors": ["Nicola J.

For instance, Bayesian networks and Markov random fields are two of the most popular probabilistic graphical models. With the rapid advance of high-throughput technologies and their ever decreasing costs, a fast-growing volume of biological data of various types - the so-called ''omics'' - is in need of accurate andefficient methods for modeling, prior to further downstream analysis. As probabilistic graphical models are able to deal with high-dimensional data, it is foreseeable that such models will have aprominent role to play in advances in genome-wide data analyses. Currently, few people are specialists in the design of cutting-edge methods using probabilistic graphical models for genetics, genomics and postgenomics. This seriously hinders the diffusion of such methods. The prime aim of the book is therefore to bring the concepts underlying these advanced models within reach of scientists who are not specialists of these models, but with no concession on theinformativeness of the book. The target readers include researchers and engineers who have to design novel methods for postgenomics data analysis, as well as graduate students starting a Masters or a PhD. Inaddition to an introductory chapter on probabilistic graphical models, a thorough review chapter focusing on selected domains in genetics and fourteen chapters illustrate the design of such advanced approaches in various domains: gene network inference, inference of causal phenotype networks, association genetics, epigenetics, detection of copy number variations, and prediction of outcomes from high-dimensional genomic data. Notably, most examples also illustrate that probabilistic graphicalmodels are well suited for integrative biology and systems biology, hot topics guaranteed to be of lasting interest.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780198709022"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0198709021"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 449, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Mathematics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_for_Genet.html?hl=&id=2URhBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xfqwBzmAM_kC", "etag": "UpJoPG8l+xI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xfqwBzmAM_kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Computational Methods in Genome Research", "authors": ["S\u00e1ndor Suhai"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "1994", "description": "Can computational science keep up with evolving technology for genome mapping and sequencing?;

Tracing genealogy is now the second-most popular hobby amongst Americans, as well as the second-most visited online category. This billion-dollar industry has spawned popular television shows, websites, and Internet communities, and a booming heritage tourism circuit. The tsunami of interest in genetic ancestry tracing from the African American community has been especially overwhelming. In The Social Life of DNA, Alondra Nelson takes us on an unprecedented journey into how the double helix has wound its way into the heart of the most urgent contemporary social issues around race. For over a decade, Nelson has deeply studied this phenomenon. Artfully weaving together keenly observed interactions with root-seekers alongside illuminating historical details and revealing personal narrative, she shows that genetic genealogy is a new tool for addressing old and enduring issues. In The Social Life of DNA, she explains how these cutting-edge DNA-based techniques are being used in myriad ways, including grappling with the unfinished business of slavery: to foster reconciliation, to establish ties with African ancestral homelands, to rethink and sometimes alter citizenship, and to make legal claims for slavery reparations specifically based on ancestry. Nelson incisively shows that DNA is a portal to the past that yields insight for the present and future, shining a light on social traumas and historical injustices that still resonate today. Science can be a crucial ally to activism to spur social change and transform twenty-first-century racial politics. But Nelson warns her readers to be discerning: for the social repair we seek can't be found in even the most sophisticated science. Engrossing and highly original, The Social Life of DNA is a must-read for anyone interested in race, science, history and how our reckoning with the past may help us to chart a more just course for tomorrow.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780807027189"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0807027189"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 200, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["African Americans"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 14, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Life_of_DNA.html?hl=&id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "y60oDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "9GVM9l0XhLw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/y60oDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Jews and Genes", "subtitle": "The Genetic Future in Contemporary Jewish Thought", "authors": ["Elliot N.

Genetics: Genes, Genomes, and Evolution presents the fundamental principles of genetics and molecular biology from an evolutionary perspective as informed by genome analysis. By using what has been learned from the analyses of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes as its basis, the book unites evolution, genomics, and genetics in one narrative approach. Genomic analysis is inherently both molecular and evolutionary, and every chapter is approached from this unified perspective. Similarly, genomic studies have provided a deeper appreciation of the profound relationships between all organisms - something reflected in the book's integrated discussion of bacterial and eukaryotic evolution, genetics and genomics. It is an approach that provides students with a uniquely flexible and contemporary view of genetics, genomics, and evolution.

How do some genes control the expression of others? How do genes interact to form gene networks? With its unique integration of genetics and molecular biology, Genetic Analysis probes fascinating questions such as these, detailing how our understanding of key genetic phenomena can be used to understand biological systems. Opening with a brief overview of key genetic principles, model organisms, and epigenetics, the book goes on to explorethe use of gene mutations and the analysis of gene expression and activity. A discussion of the genetic structure of natural populations follows, before the interaction of genes during suppression and epistasis, how we study gene networks, and personalized genomics are considered. Drawing on the latest experimental tools, including microarrays, RNAi screens, and bioinformatics approaches, Genetic Analysis provides a state-of-the-art review of the field, but in a truly student-friendly manner. It uses extended case studies and text boxes to augment the narrative, taking the reader right to the forefront of contemporary research, without losing clarity of explanation and insight. We are in an age where, despite knowing so much about biological systems, we are just beginning to realise how much more there is still to understand. Genetic Analysis is the ideal guide to how we can use the awesome power of molecular genetics to further our understanding. Online Resource Centre: The Online Resource Centre to accompany Genetic Analysis features the following resources for teachers and students: For students: * Topical updates - key updates on topics or tools presented in the book, to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. * Additional case studies and text boxes to complement and add to those found in the book. * Practice problems, to test the reader's knowledge of the concepts presented, and help to master them.

In recent decades the flourishing of developmental biology, genomics, epigenetics and our increased understanding of neuronal plasticity have all helped to subvert such dichotomous notions. Nevertheless, the media still report the discovery of a gene 'for' this or that behaviour, and the field of behavioural genetics continues to extend its reach into the social sciences, reporting the heritability of such human traits as religiosity and political affiliation. There are many continuing challenges to notions of human freedom and moral responsibility, with consequent implications for social flourishing, the legal system and religious beliefs. In this book, Denis Alexander critically examines these challenges, concluding that genuine free will, often influenced by genetic variation, emerges from an integrated view of human personhood derived from contemporary biology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781107141148"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1107141141"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 376, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Religion"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Genes_Determinism_and_God.html?hl=&id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "akd4PdQZQyUC", "etag": "vD5J7WyrqpU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/akd4PdQZQyUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Race and the Genetic Revolution", "subtitle": "Science, Myth, and Culture", "authors": ["Sheldon Krimsky", "Kathleen Sloan"], "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "\"A project of the Council for Responsible Genetics.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231156974"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231156979"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 296, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Race_and_the_Genetic_Revolution.html?hl=&id=akd4PdQZQyUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "7CEmKh5S0SUC", "etag": "SFXibcnyO70", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7CEmKh5S0SUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Y", "subtitle": "The Descent of Men", "authors": ["Steve Jones"], "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "In his highly entertaining and enlightening book, the acclaimed geneticist and author Steve Jones offers a landmark exploration of maleness.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), generally including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have recently been found to have potential roles in these diseases, and provide new opportunities for developing both specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, the molecular function and regulation of these RNAs still remains challenging. Numerous studies are focusing on this field in order to fully appreciate the role and regulation of these molecules in human medicine and biology. This e-book aims to bring together new findings on Non-coding RNAs in different complex diseases. It will highlight the characterization, roles, mechanism, and mode of action of these RNAs in complex disorders. We believe that the publications on this topic would be exponentially extended in future. The improved approaches at multiple levels may pave the way for designing and applying new biomarker and therapeutic targets for specific diseases based on these attractive molecules.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889450022"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889450023"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Molecular_Function_and_Regulation_of_Non.html?hl=&id=oNInDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vnR6MqBAueIC", "etag": "mDfWJc2GcUI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vnR6MqBAueIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Manual of Medical Laboratory Techniques", "authors": ["S Ramakrishnan", "KN Sulochana"], "publisher": "JP Medical Ltd", "publishedDate": "2012-03-29", "description": "This manual is a complete guide to medical laboratory techniques used in medical microbiology, haematology, clinical biochemistry, histopathology, human genetics and molecular biology.

The book provides underlying concepts and state-of-art developments in the emerging fields of DNA electronics, structural DNA nanotechnology, DNA computing and DNA data storage, DNA machines and nanorobots. Future possibilities of innovative DNA-based technologies, such as DNA cryptography, DNA identity tags, DNA nanostructures in biosensing and nanomedicine, as well as DNA-based nanoelectronics are all covered, too. This book is valuable for university students studying engineering and technology; biotech, nanotech, and medical device R&D managers, practitioners and investors; and IP analysts who would like to extend their background in advanced DNA technologies. It is nicely illustrated, which makes it very readable, and it conveys science and principles in a lively language to appeal to a broad audience, from professionals and academics to students and lay readers. Advance Praise for DNA Beyond Genes: \u201cMost students of DNA, and lay readers as well, are interested in the absolutely essential role it plays in biology. However, the properties which make DNA the carrier of genetic information also make it an extraordinary material that can be used as the backbone for a wide variety of nanoengineering applications \u2013 these range from information storage and computation to molecular machines and devices to artfully designed logos and symbols. The perfect self-recognition of DNA sequences makes it an ideal building block to synthesize more and more elaborate constructions and imaginative scientists have probably only just scratched the surface of what can eventually be created.

Up to date, epigenetic modifications involve at least three general mechanisms regulating gene expression: histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). For the past two decades, an explosion in our interest and understanding of epigenetic mechanisms has been seen. This mainly based on the influence that epigenetic alterations have on an amazing number of biological processes, such as gene expression, imprinting, programmed DNA rearrangements, germ line silencing, developmentally cued stem cell division, and overall chromosomal stability and identity. It has become also evident that the constant exposure of living organisms to environment factors affects their genomes through epigenetic mechanisms. Viruses infecting animal cells are thought to play central roles in shaping the epigenetic scenario of infected cells. In this context it has become obvious that knowing the impact that viral infections have on the epigenetic control of their host cells will certainly lead to a better understanding of the interplay viruses have with animal cells. In fact, DNA viruses use host transcription factors as well as epigenetic regulators in such a way that they affect epigenetic control of gene expression that extends to host gene expression. At the same time, animal cells employ mechanisms controlling transcription factors and epigenetic processes, in order to eliminate viral infections. In summary, epigenetic mechanisms are involved in most virus-cell interactions. We now know that some viruses exhibit epigenetic immune evasion mechanisms to survive and propagate in their host; however, there is still much ambiguity over these epigenetic mechanisms of viral immune evasion, and most of the discovered mechanisms are still incomplete. Other animal viruses associated to cancer often deregulate cellular epigenetic mechanisms, silencing cellular tumor-suppressor genes and/or activating either viral or host cell oncogenes. In addition, in several cancers the down-regulation of tumor suppressor protein-coding genes and ncRNAs with growth inhibitory functions, such as miRNAs, have been closely linked to the presence of cell CpG island promoter hypermethylation. The goal of the aforementioned Research Topic is to bring together the key experimental and theoretical research, linking state-of-the-art knowledge about the epigenetic mechanisms involved in animal virus-cell interactions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889195879"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889195872"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OnK5CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OnK5CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OnK5CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OnK5CgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Epigenetic_Modifications_and_Viral_Infec.html?hl=&id=OnK5CgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OnK5CgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oJt0BAAAQBAJ", "etag": "LkCjkFGz7HA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oJt0BAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Eugenic Design", "subtitle": "Streamlining America in the 1930s", "authors": ["Christina Cogdell"], "publisher": "University of Pennsylvania Press", "publishedDate": "2010-07-23", "description": "In 1939, Vogue magazine invited commercial designer Raymond Loewy and eight of his contemporaries\u2014including Walter Dorwin Teague, Egmont Arens, and Henry Dreyfuss\u2014to design a dress for the \"Woman of the Future\" as part of its special issue promoting the New York World's Fair and its theme, \"The World of Tomorrow.\" While focusing primarily on her clothing and accessories, many commented as well on the future woman's physique, predicting that her body and mind would be perfected through the implementation of eugenics. Industrial designers' fascination with eugenics\u2014especially that of Norman Bel Geddes\u2014began during the previous decade, and its principles permeated their theories of the modern design style known as \"streamlining.\" In Eugenic Design, Christina Cogdell charts new territory in the history of industrial design, popular science, and American culture in the 1930s by uncovering the links between streamline design and eugenics, the pseudoscientific belief that the best human traits could\u2014and should\u2014be cultivated through selective breeding. Streamline designers approached products the same way eugenicists approached bodies. Both considered themselves to be reformers advancing evolutionary progress through increased efficiency, hygiene and the creation of a utopian \"ideal type.\" Cogdell reconsiders the popular streamline style in U.S. industrial design and proposes that in theory, rhetoric, and context the style served as a material embodiment of eugenic ideology. With careful analysis and abundant illustrations, Eugenic Design is an ambitious reinterpretation of one of America's most significant and popular design forms, ultimately grappling with the question of how ideology influences design.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780812221220"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0812221222"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJt0BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJt0BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oJt0BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oJt0BAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Eugenic_Design.html?hl=&id=oJt0BAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oJt0BAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "IjjjCQAAQBAJ", "etag": "v17Ph9rwIoo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IjjjCQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Race", "authors": ["Peter Wade"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2015-07-02", "description": "An introduction to race that compares diverse historical and regional contexts, illustrated with numerous examples from daily life.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781107034112"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1107034116"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IjjjCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IjjjCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IjjjCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IjjjCQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Race.html?hl=&id=IjjjCQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IjjjCQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "4IjUDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "L+2CuKheLDk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/4IjUDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Theranostics Approaches to Gastric and Colon Cancer", "authors": ["Ganji Seeta Rama Raju", "L.V.K.S.

It is involved in virtually all cellular processes by regulating protein function, localization and stability and by mediating protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, aberrant protein phosphorylation is implicated in the onset and progression of human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In the last years, tens of thousands of in vivo phosphorylation events have been identified by large-scale quantitative phospho-proteomics experiment suggesting that a large fraction of the proteome might be regulated by phosphorylation. This data explosion is increasingly enabling the development of computational approaches, often combined with experimental validation, aiming at prioritizing phosphosites and assessing their functional relevance. Some computational approaches also address the inference of specificity determinants of protein kinases/phosphatases and the identification of phosphoresidue recognition domains. In this context, several challenging issues are still open regarding phosphorylation, including a better understanding of the interplay between phosphorylation and allosteric regulation, agents and mechanisms disrupting or promoting abnormal phosphorylation in diseases, the identification and modulation of novel phosphorylation inhibitors, and so forth. Furthermore, the determinants of kinase and phosphatase recognition and binding specificity are still unknown in several cases, as well as the impact of disease mutations on phosphorylation-mediated signaling. The articles included in this Research Topic illustrate the very diverse aspects of phosphorylation, ranging from structural changes induced by phosphorylation to the peculiarities of phosphosite evolution. Some also provide a glimpse into the huge complexity of phosphorylation networks and pathways in health and disease, and underscore that a deeper knowledge of such processes is essential to identify disease biomarkers, on one hand, and design more effective therapeutic strategies, on the other.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889199006"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889199002"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eiguDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eiguDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eiguDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eiguDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Protein_Phosphorylation_in_Health_and_Di.html?hl=&id=eiguDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eiguDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cQxMMaO3KOgC", "etag": "j7xt4oaceCU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cQxMMaO3KOgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Environmental Risk Assessment of Genetically Modified Organisms", "authors": ["A.

It prepares the students to learn to formulate genetic hypothesis and apply critical thinking skill necessary for problem solving, while also gaining a sense of the social and historical context in which genetics has developed. This text also has a completely novel way to illustrate the one or two experiments in each chapter that are rigorously examined according to the scientific method. It starts with the premise that the syllabus for a university course in genetics should reflect the major research issues of the new millennium rather than those topics that were in vogue during the last decades of nineteenth century. The text covers both the basic and practical aspects of Genetics. Fundamental knowledge is developed within the context of applied relevance. Principles are supplemented with examples.

Following these advances, the author discusses the European biotechnology strategy, the birth and implementation of European biotechnology programmes and the yeast genome project. After a detailed description of scientific policy and administrative, technical and scientific achievements, the principal stages of the yeast project and its major benefits are discussed. This enables the reader to obtain a panoramic view of this developing discipline at the dawn of the twenty-first century, as well as a better knowledge of the means deployed at international level. The conclusion gives a very detailed account of the genesis and early stages of this new scientific and technological field called genomics which appears to be a key component of modern industry.

It mainly assists in modeling, predicting and interpreting large multidimensional biological data by utilizing advanced computational methods. Despite its enormous potential, bioinformatics is not widely integrated into the academic curriculum as most life science students and researchers are still not equipped with the necessary knowledge to take advantage of this powerful tool. Hence, the primary purpose of our book is to supplement this unmet need by providing an easily accessible platform for students and researchers starting their career in life sciences. This book aims to avoid sophisticated computational algorithms and programming. Instead, it will mostly focus on simple DIY analysis and interpretation of biological data with personal computers. Our belief is that once the beginners acquire these basic skillsets, they will be able to handle most of the bioinformatics tools for their research work and to better understand their experimental outcomes. The third volume is titled In Silico Life Sciences: Agriculture. It focuses on plant genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomics data. Using examples of new crop diseases-emergence, crop productivity and biotic/abiotic stress tolerance, this book illustrates how bioinformatics can be an integral components of modern day plant science research.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030193188"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030193187"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 218, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=62&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2pK7DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Essentials_of_Bioinformatics_Volume_III-sample-epub.acsm?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Essentials_of_Bioinformatics_Volume_III-sample-pdf.acsm?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2pK7DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "GLm9DwAAQBAJ", "etag": "thFG2cMCIds", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GLm9DwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Translational Research and Onco-Omics Applications in the Era of Cancer Personal Genomics", "authors": ["Erika Ruiz-Garcia", "Horacio Astudillo-de la Vega"], "publisher": "Springer Nature", "publishedDate": "2019-11-11", "description": "Being a complex disease that affects millions of people world over, cancer research has assumed great significance.

Keller continues with an exploration of the border traffic between biology and physics, focusing on the question of life and the law of increasing entropy. In a final section she traces the impact of new metaphors, born of the computer revolution, on the course of biological research. Keller shows how these metaphors began as objects of contestation between competing visions of the life sciences, how they came to be recast and appropriated by already established research agendas, and how in the process they ultimately came to subvert those same agendas. Refiguring Life explains how the metaphors and machinery of research are not merely the products of scientific discovery but actually work together to map out the territory along which new metaphors and machines can be constructed. Through their dynamic interaction, Keller points out, they define the realm of the possible in science. Drawing on a remarkable spectrum of theoretical work ranging from Schroedinger to French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Refiguring Life fuses issues already prominent in the humanities and social sciences with those in the physical and natural sciences, transgressing disciplinary boundaries to offer a broad view of the natural sciences as a whole. Moving gracefully from genetics to embryology, from physics to biology, from cyberscience to molecular biology, Evelyn Fox Keller demonstrates that scientific inquiry cannot pretend to stand apart from the issues and concerns of the larger society in which it exists.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231102054"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231102056"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 134, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WuOFxPilBMQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WuOFxPilBMQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WuOFxPilBMQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WuOFxPilBMQC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Refiguring_Life.html?hl=&id=WuOFxPilBMQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Refiguring_Life-sample-epub.acsm?id=WuOFxPilBMQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WuOFxPilBMQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_wzc03GNpA8C", "etag": "du8vedccNUc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_wzc03GNpA8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Shattered Self", "subtitle": "The End of Natural Evolution", "authors": ["Pierre Baldi"], "publisher": "MIT Press", "publishedDate": "2002-08", "description": "An exploration of the far-reaching scientific and social changes made possible by advances in molecular biotechnology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262523345"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262523349"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 245, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_wzc03GNpA8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_wzc03GNpA8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_wzc03GNpA8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_wzc03GNpA8C&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Shattered_Self.html?hl=&id=_wzc03GNpA8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_wzc03GNpA8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "APeZF4wE4sgC", "etag": "3QuA+HkgAXc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/APeZF4wE4sgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "An A to Z of DNA Science", "subtitle": "What Scientists Mean when They Talk about Genes and Genomes", "authors": ["Jeffre L.

Contributions from scientists of varied backgrounds--anthropologists, chemists, computer specialists, engineers, mathematicians, paleontologists, physicians, and physicists--to its development is one major reason for its prodigious growth. Such growth is accompanied by a proliferation in terminology, which creates a problem both to beginning students and scientists from other disciplines who read papers by geneticists. Various terms, especially in molecular and cell biology, are newly coined and thus not found in any collegiate or biology dictionaries; in some cases, species names are even unfamiliar to students with little or no background in taxonomy. This fifth edition of the much-needed Dictionary of Genetics contains over 6,500 definitions of terms and species names relevant to the study of genetics. The entries include both strictly genetic and non-genetic terms often encountered in the literature. Also featured is a classification where all the species cited in the text are cross-referenced. There is a chronology covering the period from 1590 to 1996, and its 790 entries are cross-referenced in the appropriate definitions. The chronology is followed by an extensive bibliography and an index of the scientists cited. The final appendix lists Genetic Databases. Thus the book is helpful not only to beginning geneticists, but anyone involved in life sciences. Physicians for example will find at least 50 citations to human hereditary diseases, along with entries on the breast cancer susceptibility genes, cystic fibrosis, familial hypercholesterolemia, fragile X-associated mental retardation, and many other topics.

During this time, the use of 'wild quantitative genetics' has provided insights into a range of important questions in evolutionary ecology, ranging from studies conducting research in well-established fields such as life-history theory, behavioural ecology and sexual selection, to others addressing relatively new issues such as populations' responses to climate change or the process of senescence in natural environments. Across these fields, there is increasing appreciation of the need to quantify the genetic - rather than just the phenotypic - basis and diversity of key traits, the genetic basis of the associations between traits, and the interaction between these genetic effects and the environment. This research activity has been fuelled by methodological advances in both molecular genetics and statistics, as well as by exciting results emerging from laboratory studies of evolutionary quantitative genetics, and the increasing availability of suitable long-term datasets collected in natural populations, especially in animals. Quantitative Genetics in the Wild is the first book to synthesize the current level of knowledge in this exciting and rapidly-expanding area. This comprehensive volume also offers exciting perspectives for future studies in emerging areas, including the application of quantitative genetics to plants or arthropods, unraveling the molecular basis of variation in quantitative traits, or estimating non-additive genetic variance. Since this book deals with many fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology, it should be of interest to graduate, post-graduate students, and academics from a wide array of fields such as animal behaviour, ecology, evolution, and genetics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199674237"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "019967423X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 280, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LHUVDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LHUVDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LHUVDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LHUVDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Quantitative_Genetics_in_the_Wild.html?hl=&id=LHUVDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LHUVDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FQhXNMY9aAoC", "etag": "q7BF5Vzl5jo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FQhXNMY9aAoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Recent Progress in the Study of Variation, Heredity, and Evolution", "authors": ["Robert Heath Lock"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2013-06-06", "description": "This 1906 work traces the development of the study of evolution and genetics, covering Darwin and Mendel in particular.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781108059626"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1108059627"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FQhXNMY9aAoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FQhXNMY9aAoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FQhXNMY9aAoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FQhXNMY9aAoC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Recent_Progress_in_the_Study_of_Variatio.html?hl=&id=FQhXNMY9aAoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FQhXNMY9aAoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "pHINwjeuF9gC", "etag": "pIW0+kn0MHs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/pHINwjeuF9gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Nutrition and Fitness", "subtitle": "Metabolic Studies in Health and Disease", "authors": ["Artemis P.

Western diets and current patterns of physical activity lead to imbalances in essential fatty acids and physical inactivity that promote obesity, insulin resistance, and variation in mood and mental health. Data are presented on the different effects of fatty acids on human metabolism, on the regulation of lipid metabolism during exercise, on the metabolic effects of endurance exercise, on mood and its relationship to physical activity and nutrition, and on the immune system. Moreover, it is clear that physical activity ensures nutritional well-being in the elderly.

Analyzing hundreds of stories from American magazines\u2014and, later, television news\u2014from the 1910s to the 1990s, Condit identifies three central and enduring public worries about genetics: that genes are deterministic arbiters of human fate; that genetics research can be used for discriminatory ends; and that advances in genetics encourage perfectionistic thinking about our children. Other key public concerns that Condit highlights are the complexity of genetic decision-making and potential for invasion of privacy; conflict over the human genetic code and experimentation with DNA; and family genetics and reproductive decisions. Her analysis reveals a persistent debate in the popular media between themes of genetic determinism (such as eugenics) and more egalitarian views that place genes within the complexity of biological and social life. The Meanings of the Gene offers an insightful view of our continuing efforts to grapple with our biological natures and to define what it means, and will mean in the future, to be human.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0299163644"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780299163648"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 325, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CgjzRXnRFQcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CgjzRXnRFQcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CgjzRXnRFQcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CgjzRXnRFQcC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Meanings_of_the_Gene.html?hl=&id=CgjzRXnRFQcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Meanings_of_the_Gene-sample-epub.acsm?id=CgjzRXnRFQcC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CgjzRXnRFQcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Q7Jts0zy_DgC", "etag": "SjvHu0idpYI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Q7Jts0zy_DgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Tropical Rain Forest", "subtitle": "An Ecological Study", "authors": ["P.

The Special Issue was published on-line in 2014-2015 and contained papers representing the diverse research ongoing in the integration of electronic health records (EHR) with genomics through basic, clinical, and translational research. We have divided the eBook into four Chapters. Chapter 1 describes the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network and its contri-bution to genomics. It highlights methodological questions related to large data sets such as imputation and population stratification. Chapter 2 describes the results of genetic studies on different diseases for which all the phenotypic information was extracted from the EHR with highly specific ePhenotyping algorithms. Chapter 3 focuses on more complex analyses of the genome including copy number variants (CNV), pleiotropy com-bined with phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), and epistasis (gene-gene interactions). Chapter 4 discusses the use of genetic data together with EHR-derived clinical data in clinical settings, and how to return genetic results to patients and providers. It also contains a comprehensive review on genetic risk scores. We have included mostly Original Research Articles in the eBook, but also Reviews and Methods papers on the relevant topics of analyzing and integrating genomic data. The release of this eBook is timely, since several countries are launching Precision Medicine initiatives. Precision Medicine is a new concept in patient care taking into account individual variability in genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, when treating diseases or trying to prevent them from developing. It has become an important focus for biomedical, clinical and translational informatics. The papers presented in this eBook are well positioned to educate the readers about Precision Medicine and to demonstrate the potential study designs, methods, strategies, and applications where this type of research can be performed successfully. The ultimate goal is to improve diagnostics and provide better, more targeted care to the patient.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889198726"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889198723"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nLcrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nLcrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nLcrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=99&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nLcrDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Foundation_of_Precision_Medicine_Int.html?hl=&id=nLcrDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nLcrDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "wDIisw1ZqAMC", "etag": "Yr/3MoTMg9Q", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wDIisw1ZqAMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A History of Genetics", "authors": ["Alfred Henry Sturtevant"], "publisher": "CSHL Press", "publishedDate": "2001", "description": "In the small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fly Room\u00e2\u20ac at Columbia University, T.H.

The first book-length treatment of genetics in Germany, Styles of Scientific Thought demonstrates the influence of culture on science by comparing the American with the German scientific traditions. Harwood examines the structure of academic and research institutions, the educational backgrounds of geneticists, and cultural traditions, among many factors, to explain why the American approach was much more narrowly focussed than the German.

This book describes how nutrition shapes human evolution and demonstrates its consequences for our susceptibility to diseases, such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Inappropriate diet can yield stress for our cells, tissues and organs and then it is often associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Overnutrition paired with physical inactivity leads to overweight and obesity and results in increased burden for a body that originally was adapted for a life in the savannahs of East Africa. Therefore, this textbook does not discuss a theoretical topic in science, but it talks about real life and our life-long \u201cchat\u201d with diet. We are all food consumers, thus each of us is concerned by the topic of this book and should be aware of its mechanisms. The purpose of this book is to provide an overview on the principles of nutrigenomics and their relation to health or disease. The content of this book is based on the lecture course \u201cNutrigenomics\u201d, which is held since 2003 once per year by Prof. Carlberg at the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. The book represents an updated but simplified version of our textbook \u201cNutrigenomics\u201d (ISBN 978-3-319-30413-7). Besides its value as a textbook, \u201cNutrigenomics: how science works\u201d will be a useful reference for individuals working in biomedicine", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030369484"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "303036948X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 181, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5038.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5038.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-W67QDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5038600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5038600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nutrigenomics_How_Science_Works-sample-epub.acsm?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nutrigenomics_How_Science_Works-sample-pdf.acsm?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=W67QDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "mFakJiY6pO4C", "etag": "7wNqE53OHDY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mFakJiY6pO4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Solving Problems in Genetics", "authors": ["Richard Kowles"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2001-06-21", "description": "This book helps readers to understand the analysis of genetic problems.

With the \u201cLabster Virtual Lab Experiments\u201d book series you have the unique opportunity to apply your newly acquired knowledge in an interactive learning game that simulates common laboratory experiments. Try out different techniques and work with machines that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to. In this volume on \u201cBasic Genetics\u201d you will learn how to work in a laboratory with genetic background and the fundamental theoretical concepts of the following topics: Mendelian Inheritance Polymerase Chain Reaction Animal Genetics Gene Expression Gene Regulation In each chapter, you will be introduced to the basic knowledge as well as one virtual lab simulation with a true-to-life challenge. Following a theory section, you will be able to play the corresponding simulation. Each simulation includes quiz questions to reinforce your understanding of the covered topics. 3D animations will show you molecular processes not otherwise visible to the human eye. If you have purchased a printed copy of this book, you get free access to five simulations for the duration of six months. If you\u2019re using the e-book version, you can sign up and buy access to the simulations at www.labster.com/springer.

These neglected tropical disease (NTD) pathogens causes debilitating illnesses, which include hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic fibrosis, haemorrhagic necrotic ulcerations in the intestinal mucosa, urogenital tract diseases, in addition to cardiopulmonary, renal and neurologic lesions due to egg accumulation in the liver, intestines, uro-genital tissues and other sites. Urogenital schistosomiasis is a risk factor for bladder cancer and increases the risk of transmission of HIV infection. Despite extensive effort to control this NTD over the years, deployment on a considerable scale of commercially available drugs in endemic populations has induced the emergence of resistant isolates and raised the need to identify new targets for alternative therapies. Because of the availability of genomes of the three major species of human schistosomiasis, and through advances in functional genomics and live imaging, studies on schistosomes have now come into focus as models to investigate adaptations to parasitism and developmental biology of trematodes and cestodes, and indeed flatworms and Lophotrochozoans, at large. This Research Topic aims at gathering state-of-art essays on schistosome genetics, genetics, pathobiology and immunobiology. It also aims to highlight advances in understanding of the host-parasite relationship, in paradigms that address this NTD, and to discuss new perspectives and advances in chemotherapy and immunoprophylaxis.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889195565"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889195562"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cY6PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cY6PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cY6PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cY6PCgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Gene_function_in_schistosomes_recent_adv.html?hl=&id=cY6PCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cY6PCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oo6DmxrNeaQC", "etag": "12+VnLKZ9Mc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oo6DmxrNeaQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Genetics and Society", "subtitle": "A Sociology of Disease", "authors": ["Anne Kerr"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "Genetic science has advanced rapidly.

Dougherty"], "publisher": "Hindawi Publishing Corporation", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "Recent advances in genomic studies have stimulated synergetic research and development in many cross-disciplinary areas. Processing the vast genomic data, especially the recent large-scale microarray gene expression data, to reveal the complex biological functionality, represents enormous challenges to signal processing and statistics. This perspective naturally leads to a new field, genomic signal processing (GSP), which studies the processing of genomic signals by integrating the theory of signal processing and statistics. Written by an international, interdisciplinary team of authors, this invaluable edited volume is accessible to students just entering this emergent field, and to researchers, both in academia and in industry, in the fields of molecular biology, engineering, statistics, and signal processing. The book provides tutorial-level overviews and addresses the specific needs of genomic signal processing students and researchers as a reference book. The book aims to address current genomic challenges by exploiting potential synergies between genomics, signal processing, and statistics, with special emphasis on signal processing and statistical tools for structural and functional understanding of genomic data. The first part of this book provides a brief history of genomic research and a background introduction from both biological and signal-processing/statistical perspectives, so that readers can easily follow the material presented in the rest of the book. In what follows, overviews of state-of-the-art techniques are provided. We start with a chapter on sequence analysis, and follow with chapters on feature selection, classification, and clustering of microarray data. We then discuss the modeling, analysis, and simulation of biological regulatory networks, especially gene regulatory networks based on Boolean and Bayesian approaches. Visualization and compression of gene data, and supercomputer implementation of genomic signal processing systems are also treated. Finally, we discuss systems biology and medical applications of genomic research as well as the future trends in genomic signal processing and statistics research.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789775945075"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9775945070"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 449, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0YGlW6Oo2kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0YGlW6Oo2kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0YGlW6Oo2kMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0YGlW6Oo2kMC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Genomic_Signal_Processing_and_Statistics.html?hl=&id=0YGlW6Oo2kMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "ALL_PAGES", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0YGlW6Oo2kMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
