It is both a text for second or third-year undergraduates and a reference for researchers who need a quick introduction or refresher. All chemists and many biochemists, materials scientists, engineers, and physicists routinely user spectroscopic measurements and electronic structure computations in their work. The emphasis of Quantum Chemistry on explaining ideas rather than enumerating facts or presenting procedural details makes this an excellent foundation text/reference. The keystone is laid in the first two chapters which deal with molecular symmetry and the postulates of quantum mechanics, respectively. Symmetry is woven through the narrative of the next three chapters dealing with simple models of translational, rotational, and vibrational motion that underlie molecular spectroscopy and statistical thermodynamics. The next two chapters deal with the electronic structure of the hydrogen atom and hydrogen molecule ion, respectively. Having been armed with a basic knowledge of these prototypical systems, the reader is ready to learn, in the next chapter, the fundamental ideas used to deal with the complexities of many-electron atoms and molecules. These somewhat abstract ideas are illustrated with the venerable Huckel model of planar hydrocarbons in the penultimate chapter. The book concludes with an explanation of the bare minimum of technical choices that must be made to do meaningful electronic structure computations using quantum chemistry software packages.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781681746388"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1681746387"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 135, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3880.18, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3880.18, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-svM_DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3880180000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3880180000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Quantum_Chemistry-sample-epub.acsm?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Quantum_Chemistry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=svM_DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book provides non-specialists with a basic understanding ofthe underlying concepts of quantum chemistry."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2VLpQwAACAAJ", "etag": "X+36/2jg0yM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2VLpQwAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Quantum Chemistry", "authors": ["Donald A Mcquarrie"], "publishedDate": "2007-01-01", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "8176494232"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9788176494236"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2VLpQwAACAAJ&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2VLpQwAACAAJ&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Quantum_Chemistry.html?hl=&id=2VLpQwAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2VLpQwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "zzxLTIljQB4C", "etag": "yaiBfncDNF8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zzxLTIljQB4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Quantum Chemistry", "authors": ["Donald A.

Beginning with Max Planck\u2019s agonizing conclusion in 1900 that linked energy emission in discreet bundles to the resultant black-body radiation curve, a body of knowledge has developed with profound consequences in our ability to understand nature. In the early years, quantum theory was the providence of physicists and certain breeds of physical chemists. While physicists honed and refined the theory and studied atoms and their component systems, physical chemists began the foray into the study of larger, molecular systems. Quantum theory predictions of these systems were first verified through experimental spectroscopic studies in the electromagnetic spectrum (microwave, infrared and ultraviolet/visible), and, later, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Over two generations these studies were hampered by two major drawbacks: lack of resolution of spectroscopic data, and the complexity of calculations.

The first part describes the basic theory underlying the LCAO methods applied to periodic systems and the use of Hartree-Fock(HF), Density Function theory(DFT) and hybrid Hamiltonians. The translation and site symmetry consideration is included to establish connection between k-space solid \u2013state physics and real-space quantum chemistry. The inclusion of electron correlation effects for periodic systems is considered on the basis of localized crystalline orbitals. The possibilities of LCAO methods for chemical bonding analysis in periodic systems are discussed. The second part deals with the applications of LCAO methods for calculations of bulk crystal properties, including magnetic ordering and crystal structure optimization. In the second edition two new chapters are added in the application part II of the book. Chapter 12 deals with the recent LCAO calculations and illustrates the efficiency of the scalar-relativistic LCAO method for solids, containing heavy atoms. Chapter 13 deals with the symmetry properties and the recent applications of LCAO method to inorganic nanotubes. New material is added to chapter 9 devoted to LCAO calculations of perfect-crystal properties. The possibilities of LCAO method for calculation of the high-frequency dielectric constants of crystals and the description of phase transitions in solids are discussed. The efficiency of LCAO method in the quantum-mechanics-molecular dynamics approach to the interpretation of x-ray absorption and EXAFS spectra is illustrated.

One will also find a thorough survey of quantum mechanical methodologies for calculation of molecular characteristics in specific states and their changes under spectroscopic transitions, tunneling, electron and proton transfer phenomena, and so on. Guides to more advanced levels of theory are also provided.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789811200021"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9811200025"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 460, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8279.21, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8279.21, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book--gmMDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8279210000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8279210000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lectures_On_Chemical_Bonding_And_Quantum-sample-pdf.acsm?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-gmMDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Every aspect of the concept of bonding received a quantitative interpretation from the advent of quantum mechanics and its application to chemistry.In Lectures on Chemical Bonding and Quantum Chemistry the reader will find a comprehensive ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "zocqImm7YAwC", "etag": "JObLWrl/Cmk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zocqImm7YAwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Introductory Quantum Chemistry", "authors": ["A K Chandra"], "publisher": "Tata McGraw-Hill Education", "publishedDate": "1994", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0074620541"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780074620540"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 390, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Quantum chemistry"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zocqImm7YAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zocqImm7YAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zocqImm7YAwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zocqImm7YAwC&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Introductory_Quantum_Chemistry.html?hl=&id=zocqImm7YAwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zocqImm7YAwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ht6jMQEACAAJ", "etag": "87nABRQSEM0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ht6jMQEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Quantum Chemistry", "authors": ["Ira N.

Even after World War II the rule of three was considered to be sufficient mathematical knowledge for chemists and the short course of \"higher mathematics\" at technical universities was the test most feared by chemistry students. However, even then some en visaged the theoretical derivation of information on the properties of molecules from knowledge of the bonding of the component atoms. During the last quarter of this century, amazing changes have occurred in chemistry, some of them almost incredible. Dirac's famous clairvoyant statement* has been partially realized. Incorporation of quantum mechanics into chemistry encountered numerous difficulties. After all, the reserve of experimental chemists is not surprising. For decades the hydrogen and helium atoms and the hydrogen molecule belonged among the systems most frequently investigated by theoreti cians. Later these systems were supplemented by ethylene and benzene. The authors of this book can therefore recall with understanding the words of the late Professor Lukes: \"Well, when they succeed in computing a molecule of some alkaloid by those methods of yours ... \". Unfortunately, the calculations on calycanin were not completed before his death. Now there is no need to convince even the members of the older generation of the usefulness of quantum chemistry for chemists. Even the most conservative were convinced after the introduction of the W ood ward-Hoffmann rules.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461339212"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461339219"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 462, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5463.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5463.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-JHPgBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5463400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5463400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Elements_of_Quantum_Chemistry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JHPgBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The authors of this book can therefore recall with understanding the words of the late Professor Lukes: &quot;Well, when they succeed in computing a molecule of some alkaloid by those methods of yours ... &quot;."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "GrZFx2P6AOMC", "etag": "0sXXYTmHfpM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GrZFx2P6AOMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry", "authors": ["Ahmed A.

Our goal was to bring together scientists from different communities, namely mathematicians, experts at numerical analysis and computer science, chemists, just to see whether this heterogeneous set of lecturers can produce a rather homogeneous presentation of the domain to an uninitiated audience. To the best of our knowledgde, nothing of this kind had never been tempted so far. It seemed to us that it was the good time for doing it, both . because the interest of applied mathematicians into the world of computational chemistry has exponentially increased in the past few years, and because the community of chemists feels more and more concerned with the numerical issues. Indeed, in the early years of Quantum Chemistry, the pioneers (Coulson, Mac Weeny, just to quote two of them) used to solve fundamental equations modelling toy systems which could be simply numerically handled in view of their very limited size. The true difficulty arose with the need to model larger systems while possibly taking into account their interaction with their environment.

A large part of this success can be attributed to the maturation of hierarchies of approximation, which allow one to approach very high accuracy, provided that sufficient computational resources are available. Until recently, these hierarchies have not been available in condensed-phase chemistry, but recent advances in the field have now led to a group of methods that are capable of reaching this goal. Accurate Condensed-Phase Quantum Chemistry addresses these new methods and the problems to which they can be applied. The book begins with an overview of periodic treatments of electron correlation, with an emphasis on the algorithmic features responsible for their computational efficiency. The first section of the book: Describes the Laplace-transform approach to periodic second-order perturbation theory (MP2) Examines local and density fitted schemes for MP2 in crystalline systems Presents test calculations for a variety of systems with small and medium-sized unit cells The next section focuses on methods based on treatment of the periodic solid in terms of fragments. This part of the book: Explores the incremental many-body scheme for electron correlation in solids, and describes progress towards metals and molecules on surfaces Describes the hierarchical method as an alternative fragment-based approach to electron correlation in crystalline solids, using conventional molecular electronic structure methods Examines electrostatically embedded many-body expansion for large systems, with an emphasis on molecular clusters and molecular liquids Explores delocalized and localized orbital approaches to the electronic structures of periodic and non-periodic solids Lastly, the book describes a practical method by which conventional molecular electronic structure theory can be applied to molecular liquids and solids.

The situation appears less advanced for systems containing transition metal elements where specific difficulties arise, like those 1inked to the quasi-degeneracy of the lowest atomic states. Correlation effects, which are important only for quantitative accuracy in the treatment of molecules made of light elements, need sometimes to be considered even for a qualitative des cription of transition metals systems (like the multiple metal-metal bond). The treatment of atoms of a high atomic number has necessited the development of model potential methods. These difficulties ex acerbate for systems containing several trans ition atoms a correct description of the dichromium molecule Crz still represents a challenge to quantum chemists. Yet many advances have been made recently in the theoretical treatment of these systems, despite the fact that our understanding still remains disparate with a variety of models and methodologies used more or less successfully (one-electron models, explicitly correlated ab initio methods, density functional formalisms). For these reasons, a NATO Advanced Research Workshop was organized to review in detail the state-of-the-art techniques and at the same time the most common applications.

The main properties of electromagnetic radiation are then considered, along with the most important relations of electrons and positrons in chemistry; the quantum theory of isolated atoms and ions; the structure of nuclei and the main applications to organic chemistry; and the chemical structure and reactivity of molecules. The theoretical and experimental aspects of interpreting free radical structures on the basis of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories are also explored. The final chapter is devoted to the chemistry of the organic solid state, paying particular attention to the structure and molecular mobilities of organic solids, collective crystal states (excitons, phonons, and polaritons), energy transfer processes, and reactions in the solid state.

It is designed for the graduate student and the computational chemist with a good background in nonrelativistic theory. In addition to explaining the necessary theory in detail, at a level that the non-expert and the student should readily be able to follow, the book discusses the implementation of the theory and practicalities of its use in calculations. After a brief introduction to classical relativity and electromagnetism, the Dirac equation is presented, and its symmetry, atomic solutions, and interpretation are explored. Four-component molecular methods are then developed: self-consistent field theory and the use of basis sets, double-group and time-reversal symmetry, correlation methods, molecular properties, and an overview of relativistic density functional theory. The emphases in this section are on the basics of relativistic theory and how relativistic theory differs from nonrelativistic theory. Approximate methods are treated next, starting with spin separation in the Dirac equation, and proceeding to the Foldy-Wouthuysen, Douglas-Kroll, and related transformations, Breit-Pauli and direct perturbation theory, regular approximations, matrix approximations, and pseudopotential and model potential methods. For each of these approximations, one-electron operators and many-electron methods are developed, spin-free and spin-orbit operators are presented, and the calculation of electric and magnetic properties is discussed. The treatment of spin-orbit effects with correlation rounds off the presentation of approximate methods. The book concludes with a discussion of the qualitative changes in the picture of structure and bonding that arise from the inclusion of relativity.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190286378"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190286377"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 544, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2690.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2690.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-TtcJCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2690400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2690400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Introduction_to_Relativistic_Quantum_Che-sample-epub.acsm?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Introduction_to_Relativistic_Quantum_Che-sample-pdf.acsm?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TtcJCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book provides an introduction to the essentials of relativistic effects in quantum chemistry, and a reference work that collects all the major developments in this field."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_drj2Do1XfsC", "etag": "CrN/SkDCXLk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_drj2Do1XfsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Quantum Mechanics for Chemists", "authors": ["David Oldham Hayward"], "publisher": "Royal Society of Chemistry", "publishedDate": "2002", "description": "Quantum Mechanics for Chemists is designed to provide chemistry undergraduates with a basic understanding of the principles of quantum mechanics. The text assumes some knowledge of chemical bonding and a familiarity with the qualitative aspects of molecular orbitals in molecules such as butadiene and benzene.

The approach is rather different from that adopted in most books on quantum chemistry in that the Schr\u00f7dinger wave equation is introduced at a fairly late stage, after students have become familiar with the application of de Broglie-type wavefunctions to free particles and particles in a box. Likewise, the Hamiltonian operator and the concept of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are not introduced until the last two chapters of the book, where approximate solutions to the wave equation for many-electron atoms and molecules are discussed. In this way, students receive a gradual introduction to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics.

Quantum theory was developed in the early decades of this century and was first applied to problems in chemistry and molecular physics as early as 1927. It soon emerged however, that it was impossible to con sider any but the simplest systems in any quantita tive detail because of the complexity of Schrodinger's equation which is the basic equation for chemical and molecular physics applications. This remained the si tuation until the development, after 1950, of elec tronic digital computers. It then became possible to attempt approximate solutions of Schrodinger's equa tion for fairly complicated systems, to yield results which were sufficiently accurate to make comparison with experiment meaningful. Starting in the early nineteen sixties in the United States at a few centres with access to good computers an enormous amount of work went into the development and implementation of schemes for approximate solu tions of Schrodinger's equation, particularly the de velopment of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent-field scheme. But it was soon found that the integrals needed for application of the methods to molecular problems are far from trivial to evaluate and cannot be easily approximated.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401018159"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401018154"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 568, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16402, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16402, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-g_SpCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16402000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16402000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computational_Techniques_in_Quantum_Chem-sample-pdf.acsm?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=g_SpCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book contains the transcripts of the lectures presented at the NATO Advanced study Institute on &quot;Computational Techniques in Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Physics&quot;, held at Ramsau, Germany, 4th - 21st Sept. 1974."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "7DZB0ITw0BsC", "etag": "bqpIq9mrMOc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7DZB0ITw0BsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Equilibrium Molecular Structures", "subtitle": "From Spectroscopy to Quantum Chemistry", "authors": ["Jean Demaison", "James E.

Determination of accurate structures is hampered in that every method applies its own definition of \"structure\" and thus results from different sources can yield significantly different results. Sophisticated protocols exist to account for these differences, but until now, no textbook has been written to discuss such topics in a widely accessible manner. Balancing quantum theory with practical experiments, Equilibrium Molecular Structures focuses on the theory involved in determining and converting measured and computed data sets into accurate and well-defined equilibrium structures. This textbook begins with a discussion of quantum chemistry and the concept of potential energy surfaces, quantum chemical computation of structures and anharmonic force fields. The reader is next introduced to the method of least squares and the problem of ill-conditioning, leverage points, perturbation theory, computational aspects of determining semi-experimental equilibrium structures, the determination of moments of inertia from spectra, and the treatment of resonances. The textbook also examines the determination of diatomic molecular potentials using semiclassical and quantum mechanical methods as well as position and distance averages. From basic elements to the latest advances and current best practices, Equilibrium Molecular Structures contains abundant references, examples, and exercises and includes a CD with additional examples. These features make the book ideal for class instruction but also user-friendly for self-instruction. It is recommended for newcomers to the field and also for experienced spectroscopists who want to expand their area of knowledge.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439811350"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439811351"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 302, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Chemistry&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5043.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5043.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC&rdid=book-7DZB0ITw0BsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5043320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5043320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Equilibrium_Molecular_Structures-sample-pdf.acsm?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7DZB0ITw0BsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Molecular structure is the most basic information about a substance, determining most of its properties."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "F5_rCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "fb2Ni5nuwP0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/F5_rCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lecture Notes in Quantum Chemistry II", "subtitle": "European Summer School in Quantum Chemistry", "authors": ["Bj\u00f6rn O.

The notes were written by the teachers at the school and covered a large range of topics in ab initio quantum chemistry. After the third summer school (held in 1993) it was decided to put together a second volume with additional material. Important lecture material was excluded in the first volume and has now been added. Such added topics are: integrals and integral derivatives, SCF theory, coupled-cluster theory, relativity in quantum chemistry, and density functional theory. One chapter in the present volume contains the exercise material used at the summer school and in addition solutions to all the exercises. It is the hope of the authors that the two volumes will find good use in the scientific community as textbooks for students, who are interested in learn ing more about modern methodology in molecular quantum chemistry. The books will be used as teaching material in the European Summer Schools in Quantum Chemistry, which are presently planned.

It is intended for those, mainly chemists, who are familiar with traditional quantum chemistry but have not yet become acquainted with second quantization. The treatment is, in part, based on a series of seminars held by the author on the subject. It has been realized that many quantum chemists either interested in theory or in applications, being educated as chemi~ts and not as physicists, have never devoted themselves to taking a course on the second quantized approach. Most available textbooks on this topic are not very easy to follow for those who are not trained in theory, or they are not detailed enough to offer a comprehensive treatment. At the same time there are several papers in quantum chemical literature which take advantage of using second quantization, and it would be worthwhile if those papers were accessible for a wider reading public. For this reason, it is intended in this survey to review the basic formalism of second quantization, and to treat some selected chapters of quantum chemistry in this language.

The undergraduate student to whom our attentions are directed is a chemistry major, but probably will not go on to graduate school in physical chemistry.

However, the phenomenal improvement in both theoretical methods and computer architecture have made it possible to obtain accurate results for rather large molecular systems.
