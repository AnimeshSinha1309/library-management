In particular, the author analyzes English Canadian media narratives of Stanley Cup \"challenge\" games and championship series between 1896 and 1907. Newspaper coverage and telegraph reconstructions of Stanley Cup challenges contributed significantly to the growth of a mediated Canadian \"hockey world\" \u2013 and a broader \"world of sport\" \u2013 during this time period. By 1903, Stanley Cup hockey games had become national Canadian events, followed by audiences across the country. Hockey also played an important role in the construction of gender and class identities, and in debates about amateurism, professionalism, and community representation in sport. The author also explores the connections between violence and masculinity in Canadian hockey by examining media descriptions of \"brutal\" and \"strenuous\" play. He analyzes how notions of civic identity changed as hockey clubs evolved from amateur teams represented by players who were members of their home community to professional aggregations that included paid imports from outside the town. As a result, this volume addresses important gaps in the study of sport history and the analysis of sport and popular culture.

Labor Relations in Professional Sports offers a step-by-step examination of how these new management-player relationships have come about and what they may portend for the future. In an engaging style that is rich in sports history and anecdotes, the authors examine the background of the major team sports--baseball, football, basketball, and hockey--and analyze how business and legal considerations have affected each sport's development. They also probe current unresolved issues and predictable future problems, such as the relationships of broadcast networks and sports leagues. Surprisingly, this book with so formidable a title is not only readable but even difficult to put down. Explanations of complex legal decisions are reduced to brief, lucid passages. Extensive footnotes are provided in each chapter for readers who wish greater detail. Choice . . . a comprehensive treatment of labor relations in sports. . . . Overall, the book is a slam-dunk success.

Gorgeous and curvy, Abbryana Ferris has been mistaken for a nurse more than once in her medical career. At twenty-seven, the dark-skinned beauty is often thought far too young to be a \u2018real doctor\u2019. Abby struggles to relay to Trevor that this head injury is career ending, and that he can\u2019t just be careful next time. One more hit to the head will probably kill him. The bad news doesn\u2019t stop thirty-year-old Trevor Miles from hitting on her. Even with his latest Hockey injury, he knows a catch when he sees one, and he\u2019s not willing to let this one get away so easily. But Abby has another admirer, and Dr. Bailor isn\u2019t willing to share. When Dr. Bailor finally pushes Abby too far, forcing her to report him and costing him his job, things only get worse. A budding romance and a crazy doctor are almost too much for her, but will Trevor walk away from Hockey? Or will he risk his life for the game he loves and leave her behind?

However, until recently, return to play decisions following a sports-related traumatic brain injury have been based on anecdotal evidence and have not been based on scientifically validated clinical protocols. Over the past decade, the field of Neuropsychology has become an increasingly important component of the return to play decision making process following TBI. Neuropsychological assessment instruments are increasingly being adapted for use with athletes throughout the world and the field of sports neuropsychology appears to be a rapidly evolving subspecialty. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the application of neuropsychological assessment instruments in sports, and it is structured to present a global perspective on contemporary research.

In this exciting new work, Jason Blake takes readers on a thematic journey through Canadian hockey literature, examining five common themes - nationhood, the hockey dream, violence, national identity, and family - as they appear in hockey fiction. Blake examines the work of such authors as Mordecai Richler, David Adams Richards, Paul Quarrington, and Richard B. Wright, arguing that a study of contemporary hockey fiction exposes a troubled relationship with the national sport. Rather than the storybook happy ending common in sports literature of previous generations, Blake finds that today's fiction portrays hockey as an often-glorified sport that in fact leads to broken lives and ironic outlooks. The first book to focus exclusively on hockey in print, Canadian Hockey Literature is an accessible work that challenges popular perceptions of a much-beloved national pastime.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780802097132"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0802097138"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 265, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k7fbejxa1EoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k7fbejxa1EoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=k7fbejxa1EoC&pg=PA79&dq=Hockey+Sports&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=k7fbejxa1EoC&dq=Hockey+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Canadian_Hockey_Literature.html?hl=&id=k7fbejxa1EoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=k7fbejxa1EoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "If <b>sports</b> accurately reflect individual societies, aggressive <b>hockey</b> is the &#39;wrong <br>\ngame&#39; for Canada, a country that imagines itself to be peaceful.

The annual number of publications has increased from around 250 to 1,000 a year over the last decade. This is due in part to the fact that during the late 1980s and 90s, many clubs, leagues and governing bodies of sport have celebrated their centenaries and produced histories to mark this occasion and commemorate their achievements. It is also the result of the growing popularity and realisation of the importance of sport history research within academe.

This book should be in the library of every institution where students have to write a paper that may be related to sport, or on the shelf of any lecturer teaching economics or public finance who has even a remote interest in sport. The material is very accessible, and useful in many different settings. Ruud H. Koning, Jahrb\u00fccher f. National\u00f6konomie u. Statistik Edward Elgar s brilliant market niche is identifying a topic in economics, finding editors who know the area backwards and challenging them to assemble the best cross-section of relevant articles either already published or newly commissioned. Handbook on the Economics of Sport is Edward Elgar at its very best. If you love economics you ll find many fascinating insights here; if you love sport but know little economics then this book is mostly accessible and will teach you a lot; and if you are a sports-mad economist then you will be in hog heaven. Furthermore, if, like this reviewer, you are broadly very sceptical about the reports consultants produce for governments on the supposed economic windfall from hosting a big event or subsidising a stadium then you will get a lot of good counter-arguments in this volume. Indeed there are several chapters on the above theme that I m sure I ll be copying frequently to government officials in years to come. . . The demand for sport is a fascinating subject and it is hard to pick out just one chapter from the second section. Read them all they make a wonderful 65-page treat. . . Part VI was a real feast, a smorgasbord. . . This is a magnificent piece of work and the 36-page index rounds it all off splendidly. John Blundell, Economic Affairs The book covers the most important areas of research of an emerging economic sub-discipline spanning the past half a century. It serves admirably the purpose of an introduction into the rich and growing area of reflection for all concerned. . . the editors and authors of the Handbook have done a commendable job of accumulating sophisticated material for many economists, managers, politicians and self-conscious fans, who are sure to find excellent training ground for the whole heptathlon. . . This book will be invaluable for advanced students investigating professional sport. From the point of view of lawyers, particularly those engaged with the relationship between law and sports governance, the Handbook offers invaluable analysis of the economic issues that are alluded to in those debates but rarely examined in detail. . . These insights will also prove useful for policy analysts and sports administrators for whom many sections should be considered mandatory reading. Aleksander Sulejewicz, Journal of Contemporary European Research Over 800 pages on the economics of sport. What a feast! What a treat! The editors have done a wonderful job both in terms of breadth from David Beckham to child labour in Pakistan and depth, tournaments and luxury taxes for example. . . The 86 chapters are uniformly of a very high standard and illuminating. And there are real gems in some of the contributions. British Journal on the Economics of Sport This very interesting and comprehensive book achieves its objective, namely to present an overview of research in sports economics at an introductory level. . . [The editors] have produced an excellent reference book that belongs in all academic institutions libraries. It provides extensive introduction to the growing body of literature in the rising field of economics of sport. The book s relevant monographs should be read by institutions, cities and countries prior to their committing major resources towards sports facilities or a sporting event.

The 1994--1995 season reminded baseball enthusiasts that a player's strike can mean something more than a swing and a miss, and the fans of other sports have experienced similar frustrations. In Playing for Dollars, Paul D. Staudohar analyzes the business dimension of sports with a timely assessment of the interactions among labor, management, and government in baseball, football, basketball, and hockey. Author of The Sports Industry and Collective Bargaining, an earlier version of the current volume, Staudohar describes the mechanics of contract and salary negotiations, including the pivotal issue of free agency. He explains how unions became established in sports, how the balance of power shifted between owners and players, and how the salaries of stars escalated. He investigates the gambling controversies and changing drug policies that have sometimes alienated fans and comments, as well, on the impact AIDS has had on professional sports. Sports events are media events and Staudohar takes a look at the effects of television contracts and international expansion. He also considers the future of team sports, discussing league expansion, prospects for growth, and the issue of franchise relocation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801483425"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801483424"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zma1OwOhQJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zma1OwOhQJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Zma1OwOhQJIC&pg=PA133&dq=Hockey+Sports&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Zma1OwOhQJIC&dq=Hockey+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Playing_for_Dollars.html?hl=&id=Zma1OwOhQJIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Playing_for_Dollars-sample-epub.acsm?id=Zma1OwOhQJIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Zma1OwOhQJIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Labor Relations and the <b>Sports</b> Business Paul D.

The authors have presented the subject matter from a practical and pragmatic perspective, yet with analytical precision and attention to fine points of detail. International Sports Law and Business is composed of five parts. Part I deals with the law and business of sports in the United States, with the primary emphasis on the legal aspects of professional sports. Part II deals with the internationalization of sports from various perspectives, principally North American team sports. Part III explores the law and business of sports in 18 non-U.S. jurisdictions andndash; subject matter hardly covered in other sources, if at all. Part IV treats the legal and, to some extent, business aspects of broadcasting and sports, both in the United States and in selected foreign jurisdictions. Part V focuses upon sports marketing in its various forms in the United States, as well as its international perspectives. This easy-to-read work is unmatched in that it covers subjects not addressed or only tangentially addressed in other works, presents insiders perspectives on the subject matter, and focuses extensively on international aspects of sports law and business in connection with many different subjects. Among its exhibits, International Sports Law and Business includes a World League of American Football Standard Player Contract form, a sample World League of American Football Acquisition and Operation Agreement, Statute of Court of Arbitration for Sport and Regulations. It also includes a comprehensive index. Its unique coverage and practical features make International Sports Law and Business a critical reference for agents, attorneys, and other practitioners involved in international sports law or handling a trust where one or more of the assets is sports-related, or considering expanding an existing practice area.

It\u2019s a town where Ohio State University reigns supreme, and everything else is less important. That was until 1991, when the Columbus Chill, a minor-league hockey franchise, arrived. Using Veeckian marketing tactics and on-ice shenanigans, the Chill became the talk of the city and gained a religious local fan base. Based on the success of the Chill, from 1991\u201399, the city of Columbus was awarded with the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2000, the city\u2019s own NHL franchise. Chill Factor follows the wild ride through the eyes of team president and general manager David Paitson, from the early formation of the minor-league franchise through the decision to rattle the status quo by going to the edge and beyond with a marketing and promotional plan that was both edgy and controversial. The success of the Chill after their first season gave the organization the impetus to challenge local civic and business leaders to build a world-class arena and emerge from the shadow of OSU. There were setbacks and triumphs on and off the ice, and eventually the realization that the Columbus of today would not be possible without the aid of the Chill. Chill Factor takes readers into the front office and onto the rink, giving every angle of how a small town was able to get behind a working-class team that fought both on and off the ice. This thrilling account will appeal to those who remember the Chill\u2019s reign, as well as those who enjoy seeing the underdog climb the ladder to sports supremacy.

Barth, PhD University of Virginia School of Medicine An estimated 300,000 sport-related concussions occur every year in the United States, many of which lead to short- or long-term impairment or even sudden death. Frank Webbe, one of the foremost leaders in the field, has compiled the most up-to-date, comprehensive volume on sport neuropsychology currently available. It presents, through the contributions of leading practitioners in the field, an exhaustive study of sport-related concussions and the multitude of management and treatment issues that arise from them. The handbook is structured within a conceptual framework, which includes an overview of the field, ethical considerations, risk factors and mechanisms, diagnosis and assessment, and counseling and rehabilitation principles. It integrates research findings from a wide variety of professional and amateur sports, including football, hockey, boxing, wrestling, and others. The book also addresses collateral effects of mild and traumatic head injury such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Synthesizing all the diverse facets of the burgeoning field of sport neuropsychology, this clear and concise volume will serve as a springboard for research yet to be realized.

Using dozens of powerful examples--girls and women breaking through in football, ice hockey, wrestling, and baseball, to name just a few--the authors show that sex differences are not sufficient to warrant exclusion in most sports, that success entails more than brute strength, and that sex segregation in sports does not simply reflect sex differences, but actively constructs and reinforces stereotypes about sex differences.
