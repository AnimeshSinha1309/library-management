From the age-old question of who actually won the rivalry between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to the one about which team was truly the best of all time, Simmons opens\u2014and then closes, once and for all\u2014every major pro basketball debate. Then he takes it further by completely reevaluating not only how NBA Hall of Fame inductees should be chosen but how the institution must be reshaped from the ground up, the result being the Pyramid: Simmons\u2019s one-of-a-kind five-level shrine to the ninety-six greatest players in the history of pro basketball.

Labor Relations in Professional Sports offers a step-by-step examination of how these new management-player relationships have come about and what they may portend for the future. In an engaging style that is rich in sports history and anecdotes, the authors examine the background of the major team sports--baseball, football, basketball, and hockey--and analyze how business and legal considerations have affected each sport's development. They also probe current unresolved issues and predictable future problems, such as the relationships of broadcast networks and sports leagues. Surprisingly, this book with so formidable a title is not only readable but even difficult to put down. Explanations of complex legal decisions are reduced to brief, lucid passages. Extensive footnotes are provided in each chapter for readers who wish greater detail. Choice . . . a comprehensive treatment of labor relations in sports. . . .

But the league wasn't always so successful or glamorous: in the 1940s and 1950s, the NBA and its predecessor, the Basketball Association of America, were scrambling to attract fans. Teams frequently played in dingy gymnasiums, players traveled as best they could, and their paychecks could bounce higher than a basketball. How did the NBA evolve from an obscure organization facing financial losses to a successful fledgling sports enterprise by 1960? Drawing on information from numerous archives, newspaper and periodical articles, and Congressional hearings, The Rise of the National Basketball Association chronicles the league's growing pains from 1946 to 1961. David George Surdam describes how a handful of ambitious ice hockey arena owners created the league as a way to increase the use of their facilities, growing the organization by fits and starts. Rigorously analyzing financial data and league records, Surdam points to the innovations that helped the NBA thrive: regular experiments with rules changes to make the game more attractive to fans, and the emergence of televised sports coverage as a way of capturing a larger audience. Notably, the NBA integrated in 1950, opening the game to players who would dominate the game by the end of the 1950sdecade: Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, and Oscar Robertson. Long a game that players loved to play, basketball became a professional sport well supported by community leaders, business vendors, and an ever-growing number of fans.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780252037139"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0252037138"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 247, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-dfZcRHk1kwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-dfZcRHk1kwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-dfZcRHk1kwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-dfZcRHk1kwC&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rise_of_the_National_Basketball_Asso.html?hl=&id=-dfZcRHk1kwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-dfZcRHk1kwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "David George Surdam describes how a handful of ambitious ice hockey arena owners created the league as a way to increase the use of their facilities, growing the organization by fits and starts."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "RsxloZaWp1IC", "etag": "TQOFqgLtLGY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RsxloZaWp1IC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ultimate Book of Sports", "subtitle": "The Essential Collection of Rules, Stats, and Trivia for Over 250 Sports", "authors": ["Scott McNeely"], "publisher": "Chronicle Books", "publishedDate": "2012-09-14", "description": "This ultimate book for the ultimate sports fan extends far beyond classics like tennis and basketball.

The D.C. metro area stands second to none in its contributions to the game. Countless figures who have had a significant impact on the sport over the years have roots in the region, including E.B. Henderson, the first African-American certified to teach public school physical education, and Earl Lloyd, the first African-American to take the court in an actual NBA game. The city's Spingarn High School produced two players \u2013 Elgin Baylor and Dave Bing \u2013 recognized among the NBA\u2019s 50 greatest at the League\u2019s 50th anniversary celebration. No other high school in the country can make that claim.These figures and many others are chronicled in this book, the first-ever comprehensive look at the great high school players, teams and coaches in the D.C. metropolitan area. Based on more than 150 interviews, The Capital of Basketball is first and foremost a book about basketball. But in discussing the trends and evolution of the game, McNamara also uncovers the turmoil in the lives of the players and area residents as they dealt with prejudice, educational inequities, politics, and the ways the area has changed through the years.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781626167209"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1626167206"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ONi0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ONi0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ONi0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ONi0DwAAQBAJ&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Capital_of_Basketball.html?hl=&id=ONi0DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ONi0DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "No other high school in the country can make that claim.These figures and many others are chronicled in this book, the first-ever comprehensive look at the great high school players, teams and coaches in the D.C. metropolitan area."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "eUjLyQEACAAJ", "etag": "lMaCr3HNxOw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eUjLyQEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Basketball Sports Sketchbook", "subtitle": "Slam Dunk Sketchpad: 6 X 9 In, 120 Pages with Border.

Ironically, an area as mundane as what an athlete eats can have profound effects on fitness, health and ultimately, performance in competition. Sports have also gained widespread acceptance in the therapeutic management of athletes with disorders associated with nutritional status. In addition, exercise has been one of the tools used for studying the control of metabolism, creating a wealth of scientific information that needs to be placed in the context of sports medicine and science. Nutrition in Sport provides an exhaustive review of the biochemistry and physiology of eating. The text is divided into three sections and commences with a discussion of the essential elements of diet, including sections on carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and trace elements, and drugs associated with nutrition. It also discusses athletes requiring special consideration, including vegetarians and diabetics. The second section considers the practical aspects of sports nutrition and discusses weight control (essential for sports with weight categories and athletes with eating disorders), the travelling athlete (where travel either disrupts established feeding patterns or introduces new hazards), environmental aspects of nutrition (including altitude and heat), and the role of sports nutritional products.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780470693018"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0470693010"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 704, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QjgKLQWFm6QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QjgKLQWFm6QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QjgKLQWFm6QC&pg=PA68&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QjgKLQWFm6QC&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopaedia_of_Sports_Medicine_An.html?hl=&id=QjgKLQWFm6QC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Encyclopaedia_of_Sports_Medicine_An-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QjgKLQWFm6QC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QjgKLQWFm6QC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "...

With incredible art from Arturo Torres, this book is a must-have for anyone who has ever stayed up late into the night debating basketball\u2019s greatest moments, what-ifs, stories, and legends, or for those who are discovering the mythology of basketball for the first time.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781683350934"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1683350936"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.11.10.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1368.92, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 684.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-i6tgDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1368920000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 684460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basketball_and_Other_Things-sample-epub.acsm?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basketball_and_Other_Things-sample-pdf.acsm?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=i6tgDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "With incredible art from Arturo Torres, this book is a must-have for anyone who has ever stayed up late into the night debating basketball\u2019s greatest moments, what-ifs, stories, and legends, or for those who are discovering the mythology ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kypWhRLY14AC", "etag": "nWuHMBaSq3A", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kypWhRLY14AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Paradoxes of Youth and Sport", "authors": ["Margaret Gatz", "Michael A.

Hall of Fame writers, including Frank Deford, Curry Kirkpatrick, Alexander Wolff and Gary Smith, have covered all the great back-door plays, morality plays and passion plays of perhaps our most emotional sport.

And, most recently, \"Spree\" Latrell Sprewell\u2014American Dream or American Nightmare?\u2014the embodiment of everything many believe is wrong\u2014and others believe is exciting\u2014about the game. Today, despite the NBA strike, despite home run derbies, despite football's headlock on network television ratings, despite the much-heralded return of baseball, basketball has assumed a role in American culture and consciousness impossible to imagine 20 years ago, when arenas were empty and the NBA finals were broadcast via tape delay in the wee hours. So what happened? How did a \"black sport,\" plagued by drug scandal and decimated by white flight, come to achieve such prominence? What are the subtle and not-so-subtle racial codes that define how the game is played and perceived, and the reception of its high-profile stars? What does the shift in popularity from the predominantly white, working-class ethos of baseball to the black, urban ethos of basketball suggest about contemporary life in America? What linkages exist between basketball and hip-hop culture and how did these develop? How has the arrival of women on the scene changed the equation? Bringing together journalists, cultural critics, and academics, this wide-ranging anthology has something for everyone, from hard-core fan to casual observer. Contributors: Todd Boyd, Kenneth L.

Basketball on Paper doesnat diagram plays or explain how players get in shape, but instead demonstrates how to interpret player and team performance. Dean Oliver highlights general strategies for teams when theyare winning or losing and what aspects should be the focus in either situation. He describes and quantifies the jobs of team leaders and role players, then discusses the interactions between players and how to achieve the best fit. Oliver conceptualizes the meaning of teamwork and how to quantify the value of different types of players working together. He examines historically successful NBA teams and identifies what made them so successful: individual talent, a system of putting players together, or good coaching. Oliver then uses these statistical tools and case studies to evaluate the best players in history, such as Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Charles Barkley and how they contributed to their teamsa success. He does the same for some of the NBAas oddball players-Manute Bol, Muggsy Bogues, and Dennis Rodman and for the WNBAas top players. Basketball on Paper is unique in its incorporation of business and analytical concepts within the context of basketball to measure the value of players in a cooperative setting. Whether youare looking for strategies or new ideas to throw out while watching the ballgame at a sports bar, Dean Oliveras Basketball on Paper will give you amazing new insights into teamwork, coaching, and success.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781597973311"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1597973319"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 393, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.5.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jltvUlb5_-YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jltvUlb5_-YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jltvUlb5_-YC&pg=PT187&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jltvUlb5_-YC&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Basketball_on_Paper.html?hl=&id=jltvUlb5_-YC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basketball_on_Paper-sample-epub.acsm?id=jltvUlb5_-YC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basketball_on_Paper-sample-pdf.acsm?id=jltvUlb5_-YC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jltvUlb5_-YC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Economists say a lot of things about the world, and there is a growing group of <br>\neconomists who say things about <b>sports</b>.

A masterful achievement of methodology, it is the first complete epidemiological study and analysis of all catastrophic injuries in all sports and recreational activities that occurred within a large defined geographical area with a large population: ten million people within the province of Ontario between 1986 and 1995. Concentrating on injuries that resulted in death or long term disability, the contributors identify both the personal risk factors for participants and the societal risk factors that are important causes for these kinds of injuries. Providing detailed analysis of 2154 case studies, the contributors demonstrate what went wrong in each event, and show how each injury could have been prevented.

Its primary focus is on basketball and helping parents make the right decision as to whether or not to allow their child to specialize in one sport in pursue of scholarship or a dream of one day playing in the NBA (National Basketball Association). The author's goal is to set the expectations for the parent and child that playing AAU basketball is fun and very entertaining but it requires time, energy, commitment and money. Solutions and remedies are given to a common question most parents have such as, \"why doesn't the coach play my child more during the game?\" Another question of interest for most parents is the financial burden it appears to place on most families that include the cost of uniforms, tournament fees, food and travel and if it's all worth pursuing every year! There is an entire chapter dedicated to searching and finding the right team for my child.

Using dozens of powerful examples--girls and women breaking through in football, ice hockey, wrestling, and baseball, to name just a few--the authors show that sex differences are not sufficient to warrant exclusion in most sports, that success entails more than brute strength, and that sex segregation in sports does not simply reflect sex differences, but actively constructs and reinforces stereotypes about sex differences.

Organized in the 1980s and \u201990s by dozens of American cities, late-night basketball leagues were designed for social intervention, risk reduction, and crime prevention targeted at African American youth and young men. In Midnight Basketball, Hartmann traces the history of the program and the policy transformations of the period, while exploring the racial ideologies, cultural tensions, and institutional realities that shaped the entire field of sports-based social policy. Drawing on extensive fieldwork, the book also brings to life the actual, on-the-ground practices of midnight basketball programs and the young men that the programs intended to serve. In the process, Midnight Basketball offers a more grounded and nuanced understanding of the intricate ways sports, race, and risk intersect and interact in urban America.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226375038"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "022637503X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.7.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=BasketBall+Sports&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3082.68, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3082.68, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2RXMDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3082680000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3082680000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Midnight_Basketball-sample-epub.acsm?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Midnight_Basketball-sample-pdf.acsm?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2RXMDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Drawing on extensive fieldwork, the book also brings to life the actual, on-the-ground practices of midnight basketball programs and the young men that the programs intended to serve."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "W4kaBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "zIscyBvIt4o", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/W4kaBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cambridge Primary Mathematics Stage 6 Learner's Book", "authors": ["Emma Low", "Mary Wood"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22", "description": "Written for use with the Cambridge Primary Mathematics Curriculum Framework, and endorsed by Cambridge International Examinations, the Cambridge Primary Mathematics series is informed by the most up-to-date teaching philosophies from around the world.

The entire spectrum of international perspectives is covered, from US, Korean, and Australian sports to world competition at the highest level of the Olympics and international championships. Whether your interest is attendance at women's events, performance and rewards in women's pro sports, gender issues in US college sports, or international performance and how women compete, this handbook is a must read for any serious fan, and for all serious scholars interested in the impacts of being female on sports performance and competitiveness.' Rodney Fort, University of Michigan, US 'Leeds and Leeds have filled a gaping hole in sports economics with this revealing collection of essays. The economics of women in sports has been too long neglected. By covering everything from women as sports spectators, to women as participants in individual and team sports at the collegiate and professional levels, to women's sports internationally, Title IX, and women's differential response to incentives, this volume not only demonstrates that there is much fertile ground to be studied, but also that the subject matter is both interesting and important.' Andrew Zimbalist, Smith College, US Women's sports have received much less attention from economists than from other social scientists. This Handbook fills that gap with a comprehensive economic analysis of women's sports. It also analyzes how the behavior and treatment of female athletes reflect broad economic forces. Contributors to this volume use current theoretical models and econometric tools to examine the legal, social, and economic forces that affect the experiences of female athletes. They address such traditional topics as discrimination against female athletes and coaches and the effect of athletic events on the economies of host countries. They also apply theory and estimation to new settings, such as how women respond to tournaments in skiing and figure skating or how the growing dominance of Korean women on the LPGA tour is a form of immigration.

The Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXth Olympiad answered this question in the affirmative, and the results have justified this decision. The invitation sent out by the Organizing Committee was accepted by numerous eminent scholars and many participants from all over the world; it was their merit that the general topic of the congress could be discussed in manifold ways under various aspects and without prejudice. For this reason, they deserve our gratitude and appreciation. By now, the congress report has been completed. It is part of the total scientific concept which includes the preparatory publication, \"The Scientific View of Sport Perspectives, Aspects, Issues\", the congress itself and the present report; and, in close connection therewith, the exhibitions, \"100 Years of German Excavation Work in Olympia\", \"Sport and Medicine\" and the literary exhibition. It is to be hoped that this report will prove an important source of information and a stimulus for discussion among participants and scholars, students, teachers and coaches; and that it will safeguard the fruitful continuation of the work initiated by the Munich congress.
