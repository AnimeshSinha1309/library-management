"wave-optics","5","This tag is to be used for questions dealing with the wave nature of light and the consequences of this wave nature. Use this tag with other tags like ""diffraction"", ""interference"", etc. DO NOT use this tag for questions which deal with ray optics or geometric optics, because they have other tags assigned for them, namely, ""ray-optics"" and ""geometric-optics"" respectively."
"rydberg-states","5","This state is for questions relating to Rydberg State which is a state of an atom or molecule in which one of the electrons has been excited to a high principal quantum number orbital."
"squeezed-states","5","Light with reduced quantum uncertainty: its electric field strength Ԑ for some phases ϑ has a quantum uncertainty smaller than that of a coherent state. Do not use for plain coherent states. "
