For three years, she dominated the tennis circuit, racking up eight Grand Slam titles, winning three back-to-back French Open titles. At post-match conferences she charmed the media with her trademark giggle. In January 1993, Seles defeated Steffi Graf in the Australian Women\u00d5s Open and in April of that year, while playing a quarter-final in Hamburg, a boning knife was plunged between her shoulder blades by a Graff fan. Everything changed. The incident shocked the tennis world. Seles\u00d5 injuries healed, but Seles did not. Now, in this compelling book she tells us in her own words what followed - years of seclusion, the fog of despair, binge eating, dealing with criticism about her weight from a brutal press, losing her father\u00d0coach to cancer and never regaining her dominance on court despite getting in to the top 10. After years battling to regain fitness and tennis glory, an excruciating injury forced Monica to take time off from tennis in 2003 and she embarked on her own journey. She abandoned the arduous workouts and punitive diets, and slowly uncovered the painful emotions behind years of tumultuous feelings. This is a human and inspiring story of determination, amazing talent and touching vulnerability, that Seles hopes will motivate and inspire others to find happiness in their own lives. Monica Seles is a former No 1 professional tennis player who became the youngest-ever champion at the French Open in 1990 and went on to win nine Grand Slam singles titles. In 2007, she was appointed goodwill ambassador for the UN\u00d5s Global Sports for Peace and Development Initiative. /div", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781907532740"},

Sports Book of the Year Award The Sunday Times Sports Book of the Year The Times Sports Book of the Year Telegraph Football Book of the Year 'Ferris's wonderful memoir represents a twin triumph. He has endured every kind of setback in life but has invariably reinvented himself; and his writing is a pure pleasure.' The Sunday Times 'Enough depth and humanity to make your average football autobiography look like a Ladybird book.' Telegraph 'A masterpiece of the genre' Brian McNally 'Football memoirs rarely produce great literature but Ferris's The Boy on the Shed is a glistening exception.' Guardian 'Fascinating and stylishly told.' David Walsh, The Sunday Times The Boy on the Shed is a story of love and fate. At 16, Paul Ferris becomes Newcastle United's youngest-ever first-teamer. Like many a tricky winger from Northern Ireland, he is hailed as 'the new George Best'. As a player and later a physio and member of the Magpies' managerial team, Paul's career acquaints him not only with Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish and Bobby Robson, Ruud Gullit, Paul Gascoigne and Alan Shearer but also with injury, insecurity and disappointment. Yet this autobiography is more than a tale of the vagaries of sporting fortune. It begins during 'The Troubles' in a working-class Catholic family in the Protestant town of Lisburn, near Belfast. After a childhood scarred by his mother's illness and sectarian hatred, Paul meets the love of his life, his future wife Geraldine. Talented and carefree on the pitch, shy and anxious off it, he earns a tilt at stardom. His first spell at Newcastle turns sour, as does his return as a physio, although obtaining a Masters degree shows him what he could achieve away from football. When Paul qualifies as a barrister, a career in Law beckons. Instead, a craving to prove himself in the game draws him back to St James' Park as part of Shearer's management triumvirate - with unfortunate consequences. Written with brutal candour, dark humour and consummate style, The Boy on the Shed is a riveting and moving account of a life less ordinary.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1473666740"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781473666740"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=smp2swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=smp2swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=smp2swEACAAJ&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=smp2swEACAAJ&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Boy_on_the_Shed.html?hl=&id=smp2swEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=smp2swEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Sports Book Awards Autobiography of the Year Shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award The Sunday Times Sports Book of the Year The Times Sports Book of the Year Telegraph Football Book of the Year &#39;Ferris&#39;s wonderful ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "mw2WDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "CT1dno2Ccp4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mw2WDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Sprawlball", "subtitle": "A Visual Tour of the New Era of the NBA", "authors": ["Kirk Goldsberry"], "publisher": "Mariner Books", "publishedDate": "2019", "description": "\"Beautifully illustrated and sharply written, SprawlBall is both a celebration and a critique of the 3-point shot.

The field of basketball analytics has leaped to overdrive thanks to Kirk Goldsberry, whose visual maps of players, teams, and positions have helped teams understand who really is the most valuable player at any position. SprawlBall combines stunning visuals, in-depth analysis, fun, behind-the-scenes stories and gee-whiz facts to chart a modern revolution. From the introduction of the 3-point line to today, the game has changed drastically . . . Now, players like Steph Curry and Draymond Green are leading the charge. In chapters like \"The Geography of the NBA,\" \"The Interior Minister (Lebron James),\" \"The Evolution of Steph Curry,\" and \"The Investor (James Harden),\" Goldsberry explains why today's on-court product--with its emphasis on shooting, passing, and spacing--has never been prettier or more democratic.

Even at what should be a moment of triumph\u2014competing at age sixteen in the 1996 Olympics\u2014she is an outsider looking in, procuring drugs for Olympians she hardly knows, and losing her race after setting a new world record in the qualifying heats. After submitting to years of numbing training in France and the United States, Casey can see no way out of the sinister loneliness that has swelled and festered inside her. Yet wondrously, when it is almost too late, she discovers a small light within herself, and senses a point of calm within the whirlwind of her life. In searing, evocative, visceral prose, Casey gives language to loneliness in this startling story of survival, defiance, and of the embers that still burn when everything else in us goes dark.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781501135767"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1501135767"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wyKwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wyKwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wyKwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wyKwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Godspeed.html?hl=&id=wyKwDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wyKwDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is what I look forward to and what I tell no one: the burn of it down my throat, to my soul curled up in my lungs, the sharpest pain all over it\u2014it seizes and stretches, becoming alive again, and is the only thing that makes sense ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9GjLDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "43DymQ1mr3Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9GjLDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Made in India", "subtitle": "A Memoir", "authors": ["Milind Soman", "Roopa Pai"], "publisher": "Penguin Random House India Private Limited", "publishedDate": "2020-01-23", "description": "There's more to Milind Soman than meets the eye (although, as his legions of female fans will agree, what meets the eye is pretty delish). Combining in himself the passion of an entrepreneur, the mind of a nerd, the discipline of an athlete, the curiosity of an explorer, the heart of a patriot and the soul of a philosopher, Milind has made the stunning-and apparently seamless- transition from champion swimmer to supermodel to actor to extreme sportsperson to women's fitness activist, enabler and proselytiser, all in one lifetime. How does he do it? What makes him tick? On the twenty-fifth anniversary of 'Made in India', the breakout pop music video of the 1990s that captured the apna-time-aagaya zeitgeist of post-liberalization India and made him the nation's darling across genders and generations, Milind talks about his fascinating life-controversies, relationships, the breaking of vicious habits like smoking, alcohol, rage, and more-in a freewheeling, bare-all (easy, ladies-we're talking soul-wise!) memoir.

Steven J. Overman mines a wide array of sports biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and diaries to construct a representative picture of the athlete's life from the rise of American sport in the late nineteenth century to the present day. In so doing, he reveals the person behind the sports celebrity as he exists on a daily basis. Individual chapters cover topics such as college athletics, the pressure of celebrity, the difficulty of balancing sports and everyday life, sex and sexuality, race in sports, the obsession with the body, and the difficulties associated with retiring. In the course of the work, a portrait emerges that transcends individual lives. The shared experiences of devoted training, of travel and hotels, and of tension within and beyond the clubhouse or gym force us to appreciate the often oppressive reality of the sporting life; at the same time, individual lives provide a glimpse of the rewards that make sports so compelling to audiences and athletes across America.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "080323287X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780803232877"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 227, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IexOAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IexOAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IexOAQAAIAAJ&q=Sports+biographies+memoirs&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IexOAQAAIAAJ&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Living_Out_of_Bounds.html?hl=&id=IexOAQAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IexOAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Steven J.

As head coach of the New England Patriots, he's led the team to five Super Bowl championship trophies. In this revelatory and robust biography, readers will come to understand and see Belichick's full life in football, from watching college games as a kid with his father, a Naval Academy scout, to orchestrating two Super Bowl-winning game plans as defensive coordinator for the Giants, to his dramatic leap to New England, where he has made history. Award-winning columnist and New York Times best-selling author Ian O'Connor delves into the mind of the man who has earned a place among coaching legends like Lombardi, Halas, and Paul Brown, presenting sides of Belichick that have been previously unexplored. O'Connor discovers how this legendary coach shaped the people he met and worked with in ways perhaps even Belichick himself doesn't know. Those who follow and love pro football know Bill Belichick only as the hooded genius of the Patriots. But there is so much more--from the hidden tensions and deep layers to his relationship with Tom Brady to his sometimes frosty dealings with owner Robert Kraft to his ability to earn the unmitigated respect of his players--if not their affection. This is a man who has many facets and, ultimately, has created a notorious football dynasty. Based on exhaustive research and countless interviews, this book circles around Belichick to tell his full story for the first time, and presents an incisive portrait of a mastermind at work.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780544785748"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0544785746"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 512, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W79wDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W79wDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W79wDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W79wDwAAQBAJ&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Belichick.html?hl=&id=W79wDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=W79wDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Based on exhaustive research and countless interviews, this book circles around Belichick to tell his full story for the first time, and presents an incisive portrait of a mastermind at work."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Ic7gAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "3cKFIKjy9j4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Ic7gAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Real Story", "subtitle": "A Guide to Nonfiction Reading Interests", "authors": ["Sarah Statz Cords", "Robert Burgin"], "publisher": "Libraries Unltd Incorporated", "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "Explores the genres and sub-genres of nonfiction and provides an annotated bibliography of more than five hundred popular nonfiction titles, organized according to genre with a focus on titles published in the last decade.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015063333051"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 460, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ic7gAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ic7gAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ic7gAAAAMAAJ&q=Sports+biographies+memoirs&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ic7gAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Real_Story.html?hl=&id=Ic7gAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ic7gAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... very action - oriented and stylistically distinctive , which seems to be a trait that <br>\nalso appears in these <b>sports biographies</b> . ...

An iconic football presence during a professional career stretching over 14 years, he played for his country in the European Championship finals of 1988 and the World Cup finals of 1990 and 1994. But, behind the implied glamour of life in the employ of great English clubs like Manchester United and Aston Villa, McGrath wrestled with a range of destructive emotions that made his success in the game little short of miraculous. That story has until now never been told. It is a story that runs from a hard, hidden childhood spent in Dublin's orphanages all the way to the pain of two marriage break-ups and the struggle to cope with life after football. Quite apart from his all too public struggle with alcoholism, the story runs through the surreal highs and calamitous lows of a life lived habitually on the edge of chaos. It is not just a football story. It is an extraordinary human story that is certain to surprise with its candour. Here, for the first time, read about the father he never met; the mother whose love never died; the routine loneliness and ritual bullying endured by a black kid growing up behind closed doors in 1960s Dublin; the emotional breakdown suffered on leaving that institution; the recovery that - remarkably - brought him all the way to Old Trafford; the rollercoaster ride that followed. Here, the guilt, fear, self-loathing are all laid bare in a story fired with hope and determination for the future.

Everest in the early afternoon of May 10,1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin the perilous descent from 29,028 feet (roughly the cruising altitude of an Airbus jetliner), twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly to the top, unaware that the sky had begun to roil with clouds... Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed Outside journalist and author of the bestselling Into the Wild. Taking the reader step by step from Katmandu to the mountain's deadly pinnacle, Krakauer has his readers shaking on the edge of their seat. Beyond the terrors of this account, however, he also peers deeply into the myth of the world's tallest mountain. What is is about Everest that has compelled so many poeple--including himself--to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense? Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.

In My Life and Rugby he tells his story for the first time, including the full inside story of England\u2019s 2019 World Cup campaign. Since taking over as head coach of England in 2015, Eddie Jones has orchestrated a complete revival of the national team. He has won the Six Nations Championship back-to-back, including England\u2019s first Grand Slam in a generation and their first-ever whitewash of Australia in their own backyard, as well as taking them on their longest-ever winning streak, matching the world record held by the All Blacks. Eddie Jones is one of the most experienced and decorated coaches in Rugby Union. His career has spanned four World Cups: from the 2003 final, working with South Africa when they won in 2007, and causing the greatest upset in the history of the game in 2015 when he masterminded the Japanese victory over South Africa. Most recently, he led England on their incredible run at the 2019 World Cup, culminating in a stunning victory against the All Blacks before falling to South Africa in the final. Learning from the extreme highs and lows of his own playing career \u2013 including the numerous successes playing for Randwick and New South Wales but also the painful disappointment of never playing for Australia \u2013 he shows what it takes to be the best in the world and how everything he has learned about the game, both on and off the pitch, has gone into plotting England\u2019s route to the top of world rugby. Written with Donald McRae, twice winner of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award and three-time Sports Feature Writer of the Year, My Life and Rugby is the story of one of the most compelling and singular figures in rugby.

Bill Gates named Shoe Dog one of his five favorite books of 2016 and called it \u201can amazing tale, a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like. It\u2019s a messy, perilous, and chaotic journey, riddled with mistakes, endless struggles, and sacrifice. Phil Knight opens up in ways few CEOs are willing to do.\u201d Fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his car in 1963, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year. Today, Nike\u2019s annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knight\u2019s Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world. But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. In Shoe Dog, he tells his story at last. At twenty-four, Knight decides that rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, new, dynamic, different. He details the many risks he encountered, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors and hostile bankers\u2014as well as his many thrilling triumphs. Above all, he recalls the relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers. Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the transformative power of sports, they created a brand\u2014and a culture\u2014that changed everything.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781501135934"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1501135937"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 389, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.25.22.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 441.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 247, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-wO3PCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 441320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 247000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Shoe_Dog-sample-epub.acsm?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wO3PCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery.

At 27, he has already been the recipient of countless accolades including the Arjuna Award, the title of BCCI's 'international cricketer of the Year' as well as the ICC's 'ODI Player of the Year', but for Kohli it's not about the money or the fame, or the roar of the crowds or the flattering attention from women of all ages. Few know of his altruistic nature and his dedication to numerous charities for under-privileged children. What has not escaped the public eye though, is how this wizard of the willow wears his heavy mantle with such insouciant ease.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier":

2020 TELEGRAPH SPORTS BOOK AWARDS. 'excellent' Donald McRae, The Guardian 'Gatland is the master' Sir Ian McGeechan 'Gatland is a coaching star' Sir Clive Woodward 'Gats is one of the all-time great coaches' Sam Warburton Warren Gatland is one of the world's most renowned and intriguing rugby coaches of the modern era, leading Wales to four Six Nations titles, three Grand Slams and two World Cup semi-finals and masterminding two history-making tours as Head Coach of the British and Irish Lions. As he leaves his post as Head Coach of Wales at the end of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Gatland's definitive autobiography provides a colourful and vivid chronicle of an extraordinary three decades at rugby's dynamic coal-face. The personal journey has been rewarding and challenging in equal measure, spanning many of the sport's most passionate heartlands such as New Zealand, Ireland, England and, of course, Wales. Gatland reflects in characteristically forthright and intelligent fashion on a lifetime spent playing and coaching the sport which has been his passion since as a young boy he first picked up an oval ball on New Zealand's North Island, dreaming of joining the ranks of the mighty All Blacks. Along the way we encounter the greatest matches, players and rivalries the sport has to offer, get introduced to a stunning cast of unforgettable characters who grace the story with their humour and humanity, and emerge with a striking appreciation of what makes this outstanding rugby man tick.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472252449"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472252446"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 637.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 318.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 637200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 318600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Pride_and_Passion-sample-epub.acsm?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qtZ-DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Along the way we encounter the greatest matches, players and rivalries the sport has to offer, get introduced to a stunning cast of unforgettable characters who grace the story with their humour and humanity, and emerge with a striking ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Pez9AQAAQBAJ", "etag": "3M92KklahZs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Pez9AQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures", "authors": ["George Haggerty"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2013-11-05", "description": "First Published in 2000.

He has been cited as a mentor by Pep Guardiola, Mauricio Pochettino and Diego Simeone. Yet Marcelo Bielsa remains one of the great enigmas of world football - a fabulously innovative and obsessive coach, who has transformed Leeds United, Marseille and Athletic Bilbao. He also lasted two days at Lazio and led Argentina to their greatest footballing disaster. Featuring interviews from across South America, Europe and Yorkshire, The Quality of Madness is a comprehensive and compelling biography, tracing Bielsa's story from growing up as a member of one of Argentina's most remarkable families to his revival of Leeds.

During his storied career as head coach of the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, Phil Jackson won more championships than any coach in the history of professional sports. Even more important, he succeeded in never wavering from coaching his way, from a place of deep values. Jackson was tagged as the 'Zen master' half in jest by sportswriters, but the nickname speaks to an important truth: this is a coach who inspired, not goaded; who led by awakening and challenging the better angels of his players\u2019 nature, not their egos, fear, or greed. This is the story of a preacher\u2019s kid from North Dakota who grew up to be one of the most innovative leaders of our time. In his quest to reinvent himself, Jackson explored everything from humanistic psychology and Native American philosophy to Zen meditation. In the process, he developed a new approach to leadership based on freedom, authenticity, and selfless teamwork that turned the hyper-competitive world of professional sports on its head. In Eleven Rings, Jackson candidly describes how he: - Learned the secrets of mindfulness and team chemistry while playing for the champion New York Knicks in the 1970s - Managed Michael Jordan, the greatest player in the world, and got him to embrace selflessness, even if it meant losing a scoring title - Forged successful teams out of players of varying abilities by getting them to trust one another and perform in sync - Inspired Dennis Rodman and other 'uncoachable' personalities to devote themselves to something larger than themselves - Transformed Kobe Bryant from a rebellious teenager into a mature leader of a championship team. Eleven times, Jackson led his teams to the ultimate goal: the NBA championship six times with the Chicago Bulls and five times with the Los Angeles Lakers. We all know the legendary stars on those teams, or think we do. What Eleven Rings shows us, however, is that when it comes to the most important lessons, we don\u2019t know very much at all. This book is full of revelations: about fascinating personalities and their drive to win; about the wellsprings of motivation and competition at the highest levels; and about what it takes to bring out the best in ourselves and others.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780753551271"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0753551276"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 500.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 250.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-P_iqBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 500320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 250160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Eleven_Rings-sample-epub.acsm?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=P_iqBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book is full of revelations: about fascinating personalities and their drive to win; about the wellsprings of motivation and competition at the highest levels; and about what it takes to bring out the best in ourselves and others."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZGaGDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "/sIO1WmDN9M", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZGaGDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Great Romantic", "subtitle": "Cricket and the golden age of Neville Cardus - Winner of William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2019", "authors": ["Duncan Hamilton"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2019-07-25", "description": "Neville Cardus described how one majestic stroke-maker 'made music' and 'spread beauty' with his bat. Between two world wars, he became the laureate of cricket by doing the same with words. In The Great Romantic, award-winning author Duncan Hamilton demonstrates how Cardus changed sports journalism for ever. While popularising cricket - while appealing, in Cardus' words to people who 'didn't know a leg-break from the pavilion cat at Lord's'- he became a star in his own right with exquisite phrase-making, disdain for statistics and a penchant for literary and musical allusions. Among those who venerated Cardus were PG Wodehouse, John Arlott, Harold Pinter, JB Priestley and Don Bradman. However, behind the rhapsody in blue skies, green grass and colourful characters, this richly evocative biography finds that Cardus' mother was a prostitute, he never knew his father and he received negligible education. Infatuations with younger women ran parallel to a decidedly unromantic marriage. And, astonishingly, the supreme stylist's aversion to factual accuracy led to his reporting on matches he never attended. Yet Cardus also belied his impoverished origins to prosper in a second class-conscious profession, becoming a music critic of international renown. The Great Romantic uncovers the dark enigma within a golden age.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781473661820"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "147366182X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1209.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 604.75, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1209500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 604750000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Great_Romantic-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZGaGDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Between two world wars, he became the laureate of cricket by doing the same with words.

When aspiring violinist Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman lands a job with a professional ensemble in New York City, she imagines she has achieved her lifelong dream. But the ensemble proves to be a sham. When the group \u201cperforms,\u201d the microphones are never on. Instead, the music blares from a CD. The mastermind behind this scheme is a peculiar and mysterious figure known as The Composer, who is gaslighting his audiences with music that sounds suspiciously like the Titanic movie soundtrack. On tour with his chaotic ensemble, Hindman spirals into crises of identity and disillusionment as she \u201cplays\u201d for audiences genuinely moved by the performance, unable to differentiate real from fake. Sounds Like Titanic is a surreal, often hilarious coming-of-age story. Hindman writes with precise, candid prose and sharp insight into ambition and gender, especially when it comes to the difficulties young women face in a world that views them as silly, shallow, and stupid.

The contrast could not have been greater - as Lance Armstrong, a fraudster backed by many corporate sponsors and feted by presidents, was about to deliver a stage-managed confession to Oprah, so a young woman from a small village in Wales took aim. She too had been a cyclist, the only rider ever to have become World and Olympic champion in the same year, and the first British cyclist to have been ranked World No.1, but as a woman in a man's sport, her exploits gained little recognition and brought no riches. She too had ridden through this dark period for the sport when drug-taking was everywhere. Nicole Cooke spoke up for those who had taken a very different path to Lance and his team-mates. In her frank and outspoken autobiography, Cooke reveals the real story behind British cycling's rise to global dominance. With a child's dreams of success, she left home at 18 to pursue her goals in Italy. Broken contracts, unpaid wages, a horrendous injury and drugs cheats were just some of the challenges she faced, even before she lined up to take on her opponents. The Breakaway is a book that will not only inspire all those who read it, but which also asks some serious questions about the way society regards women's sport.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781471130366"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1471130363"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=59&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 492.06, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 344.44, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC&rdid=book-Kw_4yDivtmkC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 492060000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 344440000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Breakaway-sample-epub.acsm?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Kw_4yDivtmkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Nicole Cooke spoke up for those who had taken a very different path to Lance and his team-mates.

From growing up in a family of firefighters on Staten Island to commuting three hours a day to high school and \u201cseeing the sights\u201d (like watching a Russian woman throw a stroller off the back of a ferry), to attending Harvard while Facebook was created, Jost shares how he has navigated the world like a slightly smarter Forrest Gump. You\u2019ll also discover things about Jost that will surprise and confuse you, like how Jimmy Buffett saved his life, how Czech teenagers attacked him with potato salad, how an insect laid eggs inside his legs, and how he competed in a twenty-five-man match at WrestleMania (and almost won). You\u2019ll go behind the scenes at SNL (where he\u2019s written some of the most memorable sketches and characters of the past fifteen years) and Weekend Update (where he\u2019s forced by Michael Che to tell racist jokes). And you\u2019ll experience the life of a touring stand-up comedian\u2014from performing in rural college cafeterias at noon to opening for Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall. For every accomplishment (hosting the Emmys), there is a setback (hosting the Emmys). And for every absurd moment (watching paramedics give CPR to a raccoon), there is an honest, emotional one (recounting his mother\u2019s experience on the scene of the Twin Towers\u2019 collapse on 9/11).

I fluctuate between feelings of reality and unreality. I, myself, delight in my obsessions.'Yayoi Kusama is one of the most significant contemporary artists at work today. This engaging autobiography tells the story of her life and extraordinary career in her own words, revealing her as a fascinating figure and maverick artist who channels her obsessive neuroses into an art that transcends cultural barriers. Kusama describes the decade she spent in New York, first as a poverty stricken artist and later as the doyenne of an alternative counter-cultural scene. She provides a frank and touching account of her relationships with key art-world figures, including Georgia O'Keeffe, Donald Judd and the reclusive Joseph Cornell, with whom Kusama forged a close bond. In candid terms she describes her childhood and the first appearance of the obsessive visions that have haunted her throughout her life. Returning to Japan in the early 1970s, Kusama checked herself into a psychiatric hospital in Tokyo where she resides to the present day, emerging to dedicate herself with seemingly endless vigour to her art and her writing. This remarkable autobiography provides a powerful insight into a unique artistic mind, haunted by fears and phobias yet determined to maintain her position at the forefront of the artistic avant-garde. In addition to her artwork, Yayoi Kusama is the author of numerous volumes of poetry and fiction, including The Hustler's Grotto of Christopher Street, Manhattan Suicide Addict and Violet Obsession.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781849760874"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "184976087X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.6.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 471.87, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 330.31, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 471870000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 330310000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Infinity_Net_The_Autobiography_of_Yayoi-sample-epub.acsm?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Infinity_Net_The_Autobiography_of_Yayoi-sample-pdf.acsm?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MhZ-AwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This engaging autobiography tells the story of her life and extraordinary career in her own words, revealing her as a fascinating figure and maverick artist who channels her obsessive neuroses into an art that transcends cultural barriers."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lt-uDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "AN7PLwv2ZC8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lt-uDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "To Hell and Back", "subtitle": "An Autobiography", "authors": ["Niki Lauda"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2020-02-27", "description": "Niki Lauda drove a car for sport, but crossed the line between life and death and fought back to even greater glory.

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: \u2022 make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); \u2022 overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; \u2022 design your environment to make success easier; \u2022 get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more.

The FBI\u2019s pioneer of criminal profiling, former special agent John Douglas, has studied and interviewed many of America\u2019s most notorious killers\u2014including Charles Manson, \u201dSon of Sam Killer\u201d David Berkowitz and \u201dBTK Strangler\u201d Dennis Rader\u2014trained FBI agents and investigators around and the world, and helped educate the country about these deadly predators and how they operate, and has become a legend in popular culture, fictionalized in The Silence of the Lambs and the hit television shows Criminal Minds and Mindhunter. Twenty years after his famous memoir, the man who literally wrote the book on FBI criminal profiling opens his case files once again. In this riveting work of true crime, he spotlights four of the most diabolical criminals he\u2019s confronted, interviewed and learned from. Going deep into each man\u2019s life and crimes, he outlines the factors that led them to murder and how he used his interrogation skills to expose their means, motives, and true evil. Like the hit Netflix show, The Killer Across the Table is centered around Douglas\u2019 unique interrogation and profiling process. With his longtime collaborator Mark Olshaker, Douglas recounts the chilling encounters with these four killers as he experienced them\u2014revealing for the first time his profile methods in detail. Going step by step through his interviews, Douglas explains how he connects each killer\u2019s crimes to the specific conversation, and contrasts these encounters with those of other deadly criminals to show what he learns from each one. In the process, he returns to other famous cases, killers and interviews that have shaped his career, describing how the knowledge he gained from those exchanges helped prepare him for these. A glimpse into the mind of a man who has pierced the heart of human darkness, The Killer Across the Table unlocks the ultimate mystery of depravity and the techniques and approaches that have countered evil in the name of justice.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062910653"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062910655"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 784.7, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 392.35, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ALtnDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 784700000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 392350000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Killer_Across_the_Table-sample-epub.acsm?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ALtnDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In this riveting work of true crime, he spotlights four of the most diabolical criminals he\u2019s confronted, interviewed and learned from."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0uRJDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "OV4ageqPXIU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0uRJDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How to Be a Footballer", "authors": ["Peter Crouch"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2018-09-06", "description": "**Winner of the 2018 Telegraph Sports Book Awards Sports Bestseller of the Year** 'Very funny on almost every page, wonderfully self-deprecating and very sharp on the ludicrous behaviour of the modern player' - Sunday Times 'The funniest man in British sport' - Metro Featured on BBC Radio 2 with Chris Evans You become a footballer because you love football.

Why are we so obsessed with being our so-called best selves? Because our modern culture force feeds women lies designed to heighten their insecurities: \u201cYou can do it all\u2014crush it at work, at home, in the bedroom, at PTA and at Pilates\u2014and because you can, you should. We can show you how!\u201d Karen Karbo has had enough.

Recast as \u201cconsumers\u201d in the 1920s, women, it turned out, could be seduced into buying anything that might improve not just their lives, but their sense of self-worth. Today, we smirk at Mad Men-era ads targeting 1950s housewives\u2014even while savvy marketers, aided and abetted by social media \u201cinfluencers,\u201d peddle skin care \u201csystems,\u201d skinny tea, and regimens that promise to deliver endless happiness. We\u2019re not simply seduced into dropping precious disposable income on empty promises; the underlying message is that we can\u2019t possibly know what\u2019s good for us, what we want, or who we should be. Calling BS, Karbo blows the lid off of this age-old trend and asks women to start embracing their awesomely imperfect selves. There is no one more dangerous than a woman who doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks of her. Yeah, No, Not Happening is a call to arms to build a posse of dangerous women who swear off self-improvement and its peddlers.

He is a perfectionist who once soled his shoes with rubber from Ferrari tyres because he thought it would help. He would wake up at 3 am to practise at his range at home if an idea suddenly struck him. It is from such obsession that greatness arrives. Abhinav Bindra's journey to become the first Indian to win an individual Olympic gold, and the first Indian to win a World Championship gold, is a story of single-minded passion. The Olympics has been an all-consuming journey for him ever since he was shattering beer bottles and glass ampoules in his garden in Chandigarh. No obstacle was too hard to overcome, no amount of practice too much, no experiment too futile and no defeat so severe that it made a comeback impossible. Shattered by his failure at the 2004 Athens Olympics when a gold medal seemed imminent, he changed as a shooter: from a boy who loved shooting, he became an athlete bent on redemption, a scientist who would try anything - from mapping his own brain to drinking yak milk to climbing rock walls - to win at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. His victory was not just a personal triumph, it was a gift to his nation, a breaking down of a sporting barrier that had stood for a century. Bindra's feat has taught his peers, and those yet to come, that an Olympic gold isn't an impossible dream. In ranges, on fields, in arenas, Indian athletes now own a new belief, they wear the knowledge that no challenge is beyond them. Helping to tell this remarkable story is sportswriter Rohit Brijnath, who collaborated with Bindra in producing this compelling autobigraphy of one of India's greatest sportsmen.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789350292969"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9350292963"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 264, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 251.85, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 176.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-6bPlAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 251850000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 176300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Shot_At_History_My_Obsessive_Journey_t-sample-epub.acsm?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Helping to tell this remarkable story is sportswriter Rohit Brijnath, who collaborated with Bindra in producing this compelling autobigraphy of one of India&#39;s greatest sportsmen."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2Z5DCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "lKIgI0FONqo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2Z5DCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "An Autobiography of Jack London", "authors": ["Jack London"], "publisher": "Skyhorse Publishing Inc.", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01", "description": "Jack London has been a bestselling author for over one hundred years.

Author of a number of well-known, to say nothing of well-loved, stories in our literary canon (White Fang, The Call of the Wild, and The Sea Wolf, to name just three), London also worked as a day laborer, Alaskan gold rush prospector, and seaman.

Number 4. It is just about the most common number in hockey, but invoke that number and you can only be talking about one player -- the man often referred to as the greatest ever to play the game: Bobby Orr. From 1966 through the mid-70s he could change a game just by stepping on the ice. Orr could do things that others simply couldn\u2019t, and while teammates and opponents alike scrambled to keep up, at times they could do little more than stop and watch. Many of his records still stand today and he remains the gold standard by which all other players are judged. Mention his name to any hockey fan \u2013 or to anyone in New England \u2013 and a look of awe will appear. But skill on the ice is only a part of his story. All of the trophies, records, and press clippings leave unsaid as much about the man as they reveal. They tell us what Orr did, but don\u2019t tell us what inspired him, who taught him, or what he learned along the way. They don\u2019t tell what it was like for a shy small-town kid to become one of the most celebrated athletes in the history of the game, all the while in the full glare of the media. They don\u2019t tell us what it was like when the agent he regarded as his brother betrayed him and left him in financial ruin, at the same time his battered knee left him unable to play the game he himself had redefined only a few seasons earlier. They don\u2019t tell about the players and people he learned to most admire along the way. They don\u2019t tell what he thinks of the game of hockey today. Orr himself has never put all this into words, until now. After decades of refusing to speak of his past in articles or \u201cauthorized\u201d biographies, he finally tells his story, because he has something to share: \u201cI am a parent and a grandparent and I believe that I have lessons worth passing along.\u201d In the end, this is not just a book about hockey. The most meaningful biographies and memoirs rise above the careers out of which they grew. Bobby Orr\u2019s life goes far deeper than Stanley Cup rings, trophies and recognitions.

A powerful, heart-warming and inspiring memoir from the UK's most famous and beloved vet, Professor Noel Fitzpatrick - star of the Channel 4 series The Supervet. Growing up on the family farm in Ballyfin, Ireland, Noel's childhood was spent tending to the cattle and sheep, the hay and silage, the tractors and land, his beloved sheepdog Pirate providing solace from the bullies that plagued him at school. It was this bond with Pirate, and a fateful night spent desperately trying to save a newborn lamb, that inspired Noel to enter the world of veterinary science - and set him on the path to becoming The Supervet. Now, in this long-awaited memoir, Noel recounts this often-surprising journey that sees him leaving behind a farm animal practice in rural Ireland to set up Fitzpatrick Referrals in Surrey, one of the most advanced small animal specialist centres in the world. We meet the animals that paved the way, from calving cows and corralling bullocks to talkative parrots and bionic cats and dogs. Noel has listened to the many lessons that the animals in his care have taught him, and especially the times he has shared with his beloved Keira, the scruffy Border Terrier who has been by Noel's side as he's dealt with the unbelievable highs and crushing lows of his extraordinary career. As heart-warming and life-affirming as the TV show with which he made his name, Listening to the Animals is a story of love, hope and compassion, and about rejoicing in the bond between humans and animals that makes us the very best we can be.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781409183778"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1409183777"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1209.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 604.75, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-dfVWDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1209500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 604750000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Listening_to_the_Animals_Becoming_The_Su-sample-epub.acsm?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dfVWDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "THE NO.1 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER.

Award-winning author Richard Williams reveals the remarkable but now forgotten story of a driver whose battles against the leading figures of motor racing's golden age inspired the post-war generation of British champions. The son of wealthy parents, educated at Rugby and Cambridge, Seaman grew up in a privileged world of house parties, jazz and fast cars. But motor racing was no mere hobby: it became such an obsession that he dropped out of university to pursue his ambitions, squeezing money out of his parents to buy better cars. When he was offered a contract with the world-beating, state-sponsored Mercedes team in 1937, he signed up despite the growing political tensions between Britain and Germany. A year later, he celebrated victory in the German Grand Prix with the beautiful 18-year-old daughter of the founder of BMW. Their wedding that summer would force a split with his family, a costly rift that had not been closed six months later when he crashed in the rain while leading at Spa, dying with his divided loyalties seemingly unresolved.

A true engineering genius, even in adolescence Adrian's thoughts naturally emerged in shape and form - he began sketching his own car designs at the age of 12 and took a welding course in his school summer holidays. From his early career in IndyCar racing and on to his unparalleled success in Formula One, we learn in comprehensive, engaging and highly entertaining detail how a car actually works. Adrian has designed for the likes of Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Mika Hakkinen, Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, always with a shark-like purity of purpose: to make the car go faster. And while his career has been marked by unbelievable triumphs, there have also been deep tragedies; most notably Ayrton Senna's death during his time at Williams in 1994.

As part of the campaign, Kaur's post made her the target of an onslaught of social media vitriol. Kaur, the daughter of a Kargil war martyr, suddenly became the focal point of a nationalism debate. Facing a trial by social media, Kaur almost retreated into herself. But she was never brought up to be silenced. 'Real bullets killed my father. Your hate bullets are deepening my resolve,' she wrote then. Today, Kaur is doubly determined not to be silent. Small Acts of Freedom is her story. This is the story of three generations of strong, passionate single women in one family, women who have faced the world on their own terms. With an unusual narrative structure that crisscrosses elegantly between the past and the present, spanning seventy years from 1947 to 2017, Small Acts of Freedom is about courage. It's about resilience, strength and love. From her grandmother who came to India from Lahore after Partition to the whirlwind romance between her parents, from her father's state funeral to her harrowing experiences since her days of student activism, Gurmehar Kaur's debut is about the fierceness of love, the power of family, and the little acts that beget big revolutions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789387326675"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9387326675"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 268.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 145.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 268820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 145160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Acts_of_Freedom-sample-epub.acsm?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Acts_of_Freedom-sample-pdf.acsm?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Today, Kaur is doubly determined not to be silent.

Having faced down the fastest bowlers during his career as one of England's greatest-ever batsmen, he now had to take on an even more daunting foe. In this fascinating new book, his first autobiographical work for more than 15 years, Boycott not only relives his terrifying battle with cancer but also opens up about the personal side of his life as never before, writing movingly about his long-time love Rachael, and their daughter Emma. He talks about his many other interests and friendships beyond cricket, with a moving chapter on Brian Clough as well as revealing some surprising enthusiasms: Boycott and Katy Perry? But Boycott has devoted his life to cricket, and his insights on the game, its players and those who write and talk about it are never less than frank, revealing, entertaining and very honest. Following the death of Tony Greig, Boycott returns to the subject of the Packer 'revolution' to ask how much it really changed things, and he assesses the modern generation of players: how does he rate England's prolific captain Alastair Cook? And is Kevin Pietersen a batting genius or a player who has frittered away his talent? His opinions come with the authority of someone with profound knowledge of and love for the sport. In commentary, he refers to the 'corridor of uncertainty' for a batsman - but with Geoffrey Boycott there is never any room for that, which is why this book is such a compelling and entertaining read.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781471130038"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1471130037"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 422.44, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 295.71, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-VnN0AwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 422440000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 295710000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Corridor_of_Certainty-sample-epub.acsm?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VnN0AwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Geoffrey Boycott is one of the most outspoken and knowledgeable voices on cricket - but this book opens up a whole, new personal side to his life."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xTnAAAAAQBAJ", "etag": "2ZRPyDBWrSs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xTnAAAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Test of My Life", "subtitle": "From Cricket to Cancer and Back", "authors": ["Yuvraj Singh"], "publisher": "Random House India", "publishedDate": "2013-03-19", "description": "\u2018That day I cried like a baby not because I feared what cancer would do but because I didn\u2019t want the disease.

Andre Iguodala is one of the most admired players in the NBA. And fresh off the Warriors' fifth Finals appearance in five years, his game has never been stronger. Off the court, Iguodala has earned respect, too--for his successful tech investments, his philanthropy, and increasingly for his contributions to the conversation about race in America. It is no surprise, then, that in his first book, Andre, with his cowriter Carvell Wallace, has pushed himself to go further than he ever has before about his life, not only as an athlete but about what makes him who he is at his core. The Sixth Man traces Andre's journey from childhood in his Illinois hometown to his Bay Area home court today. Basketball has always been there. But this is the story, too, of his experience of the conflict and racial tension always at hand in a professional league made up largely of African American men; of whether and why the athlete owes the total sacrifice of his body; of the relationship between competition and brotherhood among the players of one of history's most glorious championship teams. And of what motivates an athlete to keep striving for more once they've already achieved the highest level of play they could have dreamed. On drive, on leadership, on pain, on accomplishment, on the shame of being given a role, and the glory of taking a role on: This is a powerful memoir of life and basketball that reveals new depths to the superstar athlete, and offers tremendous insight into most urgent stories being told in American society today.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780525533993"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0525533990"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LIfnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LIfnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LIfnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LIfnDwAAQBAJ&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Sixth_Man.html?hl=&id=LIfnDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LIfnDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AbugDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "SMqPkl91mgg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AbugDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "An Improbable Life", "subtitle": "The Autobiography", "authors": ["Trevor McDonald"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2019-10-17", "description": "Sir Trevor McDonald is an extraordinary man - and he has led an improbable life.

Ernie Banks, the first-ballot Hall of Famer and All-Century Team shortstop, played in fourteen All-Star Games, won two MVPs, and twice led the Major Leagues in home runs and runs batted in. He outslugged Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and Mickey Mantle when they were in their prime, but while they made repeated World Series appearances in the 1950s and 60s, Banks spent his entire career with the woebegone Chicago Cubs, who didn't win a pennant in his adult lifetime. Today, Banks is remembered best for his signature phrase, \"Let's play two,\" which has entered the American lexicon and exemplifies the enthusiasm that endeared him to fans everywhere. But Banks's public display of good cheer was a mask that hid a deeply conflicted, melancholy, and often quite lonely man. Despite the poverty and racism he endured as a young man, he was among the star players of baseball's early days of integration who were reluctant to speak out about Civil Rights. Being known as one of the greatest players never to reach the World Series also took its toll. At one point, Banks even saw a psychiatrist to see if that would help. It didn't. Yet Banks smiled through it all, enduring the scorn of Cubs manager Leo Durocher as an aging superstar and never uttering a single complaint. Let's Play Two is based on numerous conversations with Banks and on interviews with more than a hundred of his family members, teammates, friends, and associates as well as oral histories, court records, and thousands of other documents and sources. Together, they explain how Banks was so different from the caricature he created for the public. The book tells of Banks's early life in segregated Dallas, his years in the Negro Leagues, and his difficult life after retirement; and features compelling portraits of Buck O'Neil, Philip K. Wrigley, the Bleacher Bums, the doomed pennant race of 1969, and much more from a long-lost baseball era.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316318648"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316318647"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.12.12.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2037.87, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2037.87, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-oJxnDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2037870000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2037870000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Let_s_Play_Two-sample-epub.acsm?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oJxnDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book tells of Banks&#39;s early life in segregated Dallas, his years in the Negro Leagues, and his difficult life after retirement; and features compelling portraits of Buck O&#39;Neil, Philip K.

His amazing story has now been turned into a major film, A Billion Dreams, in which he stars. The greatest run-scorer in the history of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013 after an astonishing 24 years at the top. The most celebrated Indian cricketer of all time, he received the Bharat Ratna Award - India's highest civilian honour - on the day of his retirement. Now Sachin Tendulkar tells his own remarkable story - from his first Test cap at the age of 16 to his 100th international century and the emotional final farewell that brought his country to a standstill. When a boisterous Mumbai youngster's excess energies were channelled into cricket, the result was record-breaking schoolboy batting exploits that launched the career of a cricketing phenomenon. Before long Sachin Tendulkar was the cornerstone of India's batting line-up, his every move watched by a cricket-mad nation's devoted followers. Never has a cricketer been burdened with so many expectations; never has a cricketer performed at such a high level for so long and with such style - scoring more runs and making more centuries than any other player, in both Tests and one-day games. And perhaps only one cricketer could have brought together a shocked nation by defiantly scoring a Test century shortly after terrorist attacks rocked Mumbai. His many achievements with India include winning the World Cup and topping the world Test rankings. Yet he has also known his fair share of frustration and failure - from injuries and early World Cup exits to stinging criticism from the press, especially during his unhappy tenure as captain. Despite his celebrity status, Sachin Tendulkar has always remained a very private man, devoted to his family and his country. Now, for the first time, he provides a fascinating insight into his personal life and gives a frank and revealing account of a sporting life like no other.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781473605190"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1473605199"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 496, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.8.9.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sports+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 495.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 129, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-o4tmBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 495600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 129000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Playing_It_My_Way-sample-epub.acsm?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=o4tmBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&#39; -Shane Warne This is cricket icon, Sachin Tendulkar&#39;s life story in his own words - his journey from a small boy with dreams to becoming a cricket god."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "GMprDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Pa1njvqT9NE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GMprDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "They Don't Teach This", "authors": ["Eniola Aluko"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2019-08-29", "description": "Discover this powerful memoir from one of Britain\u2019s most inspiring women **LONGLISTED FOR THE WILLIAM HILL SPORTS BOOK OF THE YEAR 2019** First class honours law degree. 102 appearances for England women\u2019s national football team.
