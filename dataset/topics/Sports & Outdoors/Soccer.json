January 2014 statistics show that over 50 million youth play soccer worldwide. Early training of soccer means a lifetime of love of the sport. The enjoyment of soccer transcends mere involvement as a player, coach, fan, sponsor, dad, or mom. There are subtle lessons of life to be learned from soccer as a team sport. One aspect that is often ignored is the potential to use soccer to teach basic math and science principles, which are essential for later career paths in the technical fields. It is this void that prompted me to write this book as a way to leverage soccer training to spark the interest of kids and adults in the applications of math and science. \u201cYouth Soccer Training Slides: A Math and Science Approach\u201d is a sequel following my first soccer book of 2010 entitled \u201cPhysics of Soccer: Using Math and Science to Improve Your Game.\u201d That first book was published to coincide with the 2010 FIFA World Cup Tournament Soccer in South Africa. This second book is written to coincide with the 2014 FIFA World Cup Soccer Tournament in Brazil. Although this book targets youth soccer training, it is quite suitable and recommended for adult soccer training as well. The technical principles are general enough to apply to all levels of soccer training. The presentation slides format of the book makes it amenable for pick-and-choose applications of specific training topics. In his 2014 book, the Great Pele of Brazil emphasizes \u201cWhy Soccer Matters.\u201d In the opinion of this author, soccer, indeed, matters not only because of its socio-economic impacts around the world, but also because of the various other benefits it offers. Soccer matters because it is a thinking game and the ultimate team sport.

In this book, 'Reversal Theory', an insightful and coherent new eclectic approach in psychology, is used to address soccer hooliganism in an innovative way. Few previous accounts can provide the sophisticated understanding of the motivation behind soccer hooligan violence that 'Reversal Theory' achieves. Equipped with a real understanding of the psychology behind violent soccer hooligan activities, those charged with dealing with the problem may adopt more effective counter measures.

Written by the team at MUNDIAL, the celebrated football lifestyle magazine, and filled with fun, colourful illustrations, The Big Book of Football by Mundial covers it all: The basics and the lingo that will have you talking like a football expert in no time. History of football, including how we got from playing with a ball made of feathers to using high-tech footballs, the greatest teams of all time and the evolution of football boots.

Legendary managers and how they did it \u2013 learn the favourite killer formations of greats like Rinus Michels and Sir Alex Ferguson. The big cups, with their histories and greatest players. The world\u2019s most amazing stadiums, including Wembley, Melbourne Cricket Ground and San Siro.

How to take the perfect shot like Ji So-yun, take the perfect set piece like David Beckham, take penalties like Matt Le Tissier, beat the offside trap like Fernando Torres, do the perfect attacking header like Didier Drogba and more. Weird and wonderful, from the way we describe things that happen in the game (a fox in the box) to the way we celebrate a goal (by pretending to be a robot) or do our hair (shaving it all off except for a triangle at the front). The culture and people surrounding the game, from traditional pre-game food to the referee, commentator and all-important crowd.

But what if up until now we've been focusing on the wrong numbers? What if the numbers that really matter, the ones that hold the key to winning matches, are actually 2.66, 53.4, 50/50, and 0 > 1? What if managers only make a 15% difference? What if Chelsea should have bought Darren Bent? In this incisive, myth-busting book, Chris Anderson, former goalkeeper turned football statistics guru, and David Sally, former baseball pitcher turned behavioural economist, show that every shred of knowledge we can gather can help us to love football and understand it even more. You'll discover why stopping a goal is more valuable than scoring one, why corners should be taken short, and why it is better to improve your worst player than to buy a superstar. You'll never play, or watch, a game of football in quite the same way again. The Numbers Game is essential reading for football fans everywhere and will also appeal to readers who loved Moneyball and Freakonomics. At 17, Chris Anderson found himself playing in goal for a fourth division club in West Germany; today, he's a professor in the Ivy League at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. An award winning social scientist and football analytics pioneer, Anderson consults with leading clubs about how best to play the numbers game. David Sally is a former baseball pitcher and a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in the US, where he analyses the strategies and tactics people use when they play, compete, negotiate, and make decisions. He is an adviser to clubs and other organizations in the global football industry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780241963630"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier":

They present soccer's four primary systems of play--defined by the number of players at each position and their alignment on the field--and then break down the different strategies, tactics, and styles of play that can be used within these systems. First, learn the basics of the four primary systems of play: the 4-3-3, the 4-4-2, the 3-5-2, and the 3-4-3. Second, choose a style of play that can be used within some or all of these systems. These include different attacking styles, various defensive styles, and styles that are characteristic of international soccer powers, including the Latin, British, Norwegian, South American, and African styles of play. After you determine the optimal system and style for your team, you learn how to counter opponents' tactics and how to teach your system, style, and tactics through practice instruction and drills. Detailed diagrams and plans of action for implementing the systems are included, along with insights on how to make adjustments during the game. Top coaches throughout the world have proven that adapting your system to match your players' strengths and your opponents' weaknesses is the key to developing teams that are competitive year in and year out.

It also discusses what one might call the \u2018stylistics\u2019 of soccer, analyzing how players, fans, and commentators communicate on and off the pitch, in the press, on social media, and in wider public discourse. The Aesthetics, Poetics, and Rhetoric of Soccer makes for fascinating reading for anybody with an interest in sport, culture, literature, philosophy, linguistics, and society.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781351180382"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "135118038X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 296, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Soccer&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2UhaDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Aesthetics_Poetics_and_Rhetoric_of_S-sample-epub.acsm?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Aesthetics_Poetics_and_Rhetoric_of_S-sample-pdf.acsm?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2UhaDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This multi-disciplinary volume explores soccer, soccer culture, and the representation of soccer in art, film, and literature, using the critical tools of aesthetics, poetics, and rhetoric."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y4wQRAAACAAJ", "etag": "ePE4A2QN2cQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y4wQRAAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Making It Real", "subtitle": "My Soccer Skills Book", "authors": ["David Beckham"], "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "Featuring soccer skills training tips, the story behind the David Beckham academies, and with insights from Beckham on his lifestyle, this book captures the essence of what it's like to be England football captain and one of the most celebrated faces on the planet.

But despite their dominance, and their rosters of superstar players, they\u2019ve endured striking inequality: low pay, poor playing conditions, and limited opportunities to play in professional leagues. The National Team, from leading soccer journalist Caitlin Murray, tells the history of the USWNT in full, from their formation in the 1980s through the 2019 World Cup, chronicling both their athletic triumphs and less visible challenges off the pitch. Murray also recounts the rise and fall of U.S. professional leagues, including the burgeoning National Women\u2019s Soccer League, an essential part of the women\u2019s game. Through nearly 100 exclusive interviews with players, coaches, and team officials, including Alex Morgan, Carli Lloyd, Hope Solo, Heather O\u2019Reilly, Julie Foudy, Brandi Chastain, Pia Sundhage, Tom Sermanni, and Sunil Gulati, Murray takes readers inside the locker rooms and board rooms in engrossing detail.

A national treasure, he created pure magic with his accomplishments on the field: an unprecedented three World Cup championships and the all-time scoring record, with 1,283 goals in his twenty year career. Now, with the World Cup returning after more than sixty years to Brazil\u2014the country often credited with perfecting the sport\u2014soccer has a unique opportunity to encourage change on a global level.

He has traveled the world as the global ambassador for soccer and in support of charitable organizations such as Unicef, promoting the positive influences soccer can have to transform young men and women, struggling communities, even entire nations. In groundbreaking detail and with unparalleled openness, he shares his most inspiring experiences, heartwarming stories and hard-won wisdom, and he puts the game in perspective. This is Pel\u00e9\u2019s legacy, his way of passing on everything he\u2019s learned and inspiring a new generation. In Why Soccer Matters, Pel\u00e9 details his ambitious goals for the future of the sport and, by extension, the world.
