Poetry depends on intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor...'In these two classic essays of feminist literature, Woolf argues passionately for women's intellectual freedom and their role in challenging the drive towards fascism and conflict. In A Room of One's Own she explores centuries of limitations placed on women, as well as celebrating the creativeachievements of the women writers who overcame these obstacles.In this first history of women's writing, she describes the importance of education, financial independence, and equality of opportunity to creative freedom. ThreeGuineas was written under the threat of fascism and impending war. A radical articulation of Woolf's pacifist politics, it investigates the causes of gender inequalities and the ways in which women's historic outsider position make them crucial in the prevention of war. Both these works started life as talks to groups of young women, and their engaging wit and informality establish Woolf as one of the twentieth-century's greatest essayists. Their argumentscontinue to reverberate in feminist discourse to this day.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199642212"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199642214"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 294, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZudcBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZudcBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZudcBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA290&dq=subject:Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZudcBgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Room_of_One_s_Own.html?hl=&id=ZudcBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZudcBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "bnxmAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "XGlXr+eeVp4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/bnxmAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biographies of British Women", "subtitle": "An Annotated Bibliography", "authors": ["Patricia E.

In this work, presidential scholar Janet M. Martin studies the influence of women on and in the American executive branch. The Presidency and Women offers a sophisticated understanding of the nation's largest interest group and insight into the nation's most visible office. Martin studies in detail the presidencies of Kennedy through Carter, demonstrating both the substantive growth in women's involvement in policy making and the political showcasing of women appointees. Her analysis provides insight into the day-to-day interactions between the White House and outside groups, the outside political pressures for certain policy agendas, and the internal White House dynamics in response to those pressures. This book weaves the actions of presidents, their White House staff, and others in government with the actions of women and women's organizations. The result is a longitudinal political narrative of the presidency and women from 1961 to 1981, with a focus on domestic policy and the departments and agencies relating to that policy.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1585442453"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781585442454"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 350, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vwG6LsaHTdoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vwG6LsaHTdoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vwG6LsaHTdoC&pg=PA4&dq=subject:Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vwG6LsaHTdoC&dq=subject:Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Presidency_and_Women.html?hl=&id=vwG6LsaHTdoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Presidency_and_Women-sample-epub.acsm?id=vwG6LsaHTdoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Presidency_and_Women-sample-pdf.acsm?id=vwG6LsaHTdoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vwG6LsaHTdoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ulvSg95OZ3EC", "etag": "rl1vc40sY58", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ulvSg95OZ3EC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Practice of U.S. Women's History", "subtitle": "Narratives, Intersections, and Dialogues", "authors": ["S.

Not only have historians challenged the national narrative on the basis of their rich explorations of the personal, the social, the economic, and the political, but they have also entered into dialogues with each other over the meaning of women's history itself. In this collection of seventeen original essays on women's lives from the colonial period to the present, contributors take the competing forces of race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, and region into account. Among many other examples, they examine how conceptions of gender shaped government officials' attitudes towards East Asian immigrants; how race and gender inequality pervaded the welfare state; and how color and class shaped Mexican American women's mobilization for civil and labor rights.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813541815"}, {"type": "ISBN_10",

prosopography or group biography, focusing on the all-female collections that took hold in nineteenth-century Britain and America. The queens, nurses, writers, reformers, adventurers, even assassins in these collective female biographies served as models to guide the moral development of young women. But often these famous historical women presented untrustworthy examples. Beginning in the fifteenth century with Christine de Pizan, Alison Booth traces the long tradition of this genre, investigating the varied types and stories most often grouped together in illustrated books designed for entertainment and instruction. She claims that these group biographies have been instrumental in constructing modern subjectivities as well as relations among classes, races, and nations. From Joan of Arc to Virginia Woolf, Booth examines a host of models of womanhood\u2014both bad and good. Incorporating a bibliography that includes more than 900 all-female collections published in English between 1830 and 1940, Booth uses collective biographies to decode the varied advice on how to make it as a woman.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0226065464"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226065465"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 423, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mewt3uh53C8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mewt3uh53C8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Mewt3uh53C8C&pg=PA283&dq=subject:Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Mewt3uh53C8C&dq=subject:Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Make_It_as_a_Woman.html?hl=&id=Mewt3uh53C8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_to_Make_It_as_a_Woman-sample-epub.acsm?id=Mewt3uh53C8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Mewt3uh53C8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "dQJaAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "zmMUCLuFR5w", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dQJaAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Convent of Pleasure and Other Plays", "authors": ["Margaret Cavendish Duchess of Newcastle", "Margaret Cavendish"], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "publishedDate": "1999", "description": "Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1623-1673), until recently remembered more as a flamboyant eccentric than as a serious writer, was in fact the most prolific, thought-provoking, and original woman writer of the Restoration. Cavendish is the author of many poems, short stories, biographies, memoirs, letters, philosophical and scientific works (including The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing World, the first work of science fiction by a woman), and nineteen plays. \"The Convent of Pleasure\" and Other Plays collects four of Cavendish's dramatic works that are among the most revealing of her attitudes toward marriage and her desire for fame. Loves Adventures (1662) centers on a woman succeeding in war and diplomacy by passing as a man. Similarly, the heroine of Bell in Campo (1662) rescues her husband at the head of an army of women in this tale of a marriage of near equals. The Convent of Pleasure (1668) proposes a separatist community of women and has received attention for its suggestion of lesbian sexuality. The Bridals (1662), a more typical restoration comedy satirizing marriage, rounds out the collection. Edited with notes and annotation by Anne Shaver, \"The Convent of Pleasure\" and Other Plays also contains a timeline, biography and bibliography of the Duchess, an appreciation of Cavendish's life and work, and a bibliography of critical essays. Also included are all of Cavendish's epistles To the Reader as well as Other Preliminary Matter from Playes (1662), and Cavendish's original preface to Plays Never Before Printed (1668).

Hays\u2019s \u2018Female Biography\u2019: Collective Biography as Enlightenment Feminism emerge from the authors\u2019 collaboration in producing the first modern edition of Hays\u2019s work in the Chawton House Library Edition (2013, 2014). This book explores Hays\u2019s larger ambitions to lay the foundation for an encyclopaedic work by, for, and about women. The scholars\u2019 contributions to this volume engage with some of the multiple problems and possibilities that Female Biography presented. Drawing on this effort, individual scholars examine Hays\u2019s attempts to correct existing masculinist constructs which framed the \u2018universe of knowledge\u2019 then and persist in our time. Hays perceived that these had the cumulative effect of rendering women invisible. She responded to such absence by providing examples of the extent of female worth across Western society. Other contributions focus specifically on the subjects of Hays\u2019s entries, looking at how she used source material and laid the groundwork for future biographical studies of women\u2019s lives. Both Female Biography and Hays herself have continually presented difficulties in categorization: not quite Enlightenment, not quite Victorian either. This book recontextualizes her work, demonstrating the radicalism and originality of her feminism, even in its post-Wollstonecraftian phase, as well as the longevity of her influence. As such, it will be of interest to those conducting research into Hays, her subjects, and the evolution of life-writing by women.

By 1979, this goal had become a reality. In her memoirs, acclaimed biomedical engineer Monique Frize recalls the events in her life that taught her to overcome obstacles, become more resilient, recognize the importance of mentors and role models, and remain focused on the future. She also speaks of her appreciation of the critical role played by family and friends in maintaining the strength and determination required to succeed. And, above all, to succeed in a man\u2019s world. Frize fondly remembers her youth in Montreal and in Ottawa, and her marked interest for math and science. Her entry into the world of engineering was both romantic\u2014she met her husband\u2014and tragic. She faced prejudice and stereotypes, which she ultimately overcame. She reconciled family and work life, pursuing a challenging and rewarding international career in a very specialized field at a time when this was still very uncommon for a woman. And she relives the tragic Polytechnique massacre. These memoirs are sure to inspire young women who have a dream, and more specifically those who wish to enter sciences and engineering.

That's not a doctor, that's a lady.\" She was refused a residency, paid less than her male counterparts, couldn't live on base, and couldn't claim her husband as a dependent because he wasn't a wife. After six years as a general medical officer in Franco's Spain, she became a family practice specialist and a flight surgeon, doing everything from delivering babies to flying a B-52. She earned her pilot's license despite being told \"Women aren't supposed to fly,\" and eventually retired from the Air Force as a full colonel.

Before she gets the reunion her father promised her, war breaks out in Liberia. The family is forced to flee their home on foot, walking and hiding for three weeks until they arrive in the village of Lai. Finally, a rebel soldier smuggles them across the border to Sierra Leone, reuniting the family and setting them off on yet another journey, this time to the United States. Spanning this harrowing journey in Moore\u2019s early childhood, her years adjusting to life in Texas as a black woman and an immigrant, and her eventual return to Liberia, The Dragons, the Giant, the Women is a deeply moving story of the search for home in the midst of upheaval. Moore has a novelist\u2019s eye for suspense and emotional depth, and this unforgettable memoir is full of imaginative, lyrical flights and lush prose. In capturing both the hazy magic and the stark realities of what is becoming an increasingly pervasive experience, Moore shines a light on the great political and personal forces that continue to affect many migrants around the world, and calls us all to acknowledge the tenacious power of love and family.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1644450313"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781644450314"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uaHEyQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uaHEyQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uaHEyQEACAAJ&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uaHEyQEACAAJ&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Dragons_the_Giant_the_Women.html?hl=&id=uaHEyQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uaHEyQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "An engrossing memoir of escaping the First Liberian Civil War and building a life in the United States When Way\u00e9tu Moore turns five years old, her father and grandmother throw her a big birthday party at their home in Monrovia, Liberia, ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ulvSg95OZ3EC", "etag": "qMJWy+GEp9s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ulvSg95OZ3EC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Practice of U.S. Women's History", "subtitle": "Narratives, Intersections, and Dialogues", "authors": ["S.

Not only have historians challenged the national narrative on the basis of their rich explorations of the personal, the social, the economic, and the political, but they have also entered into dialogues with each other over the meaning of women's history itself. In this collection of seventeen original essays on women's lives from the colonial period to the present, contributors take the competing forces of race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, and region into account. Among many other examples, they examine how conceptions of gender shaped government officials' attitudes towards East Asian immigrants; how race and gender inequality pervaded the welfare state; and how color and class shaped Mexican American women's mobilization for civil and labor rights.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813541815"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0813541816"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 370, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&pg=PA308&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Practice_of_U_S_Women_s_History.html?hl=&id=ulvSg95OZ3EC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Practice_of_U_S_Women_s_History-sample-epub.acsm?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "...

This major work of criticism also offers fresh insights about women's writing in all literary forms, not only fiction, but also poetry, drama, memoir, autobiography, biography, history, essay, translation and the familiar letter. Authors celebrated in their own time and who have been neglected, and those who have been revalued and studied, are given equal attention.

Life among the Scorpions recounts the deeply fascinating and often tumultuous events that mark thirty years of Jaya Jaitly's political journey. From arranging relief for victims of the 1984 Sikh riots, to joining politics under firebrand leader George Fernandes, to becoming the president of Samata Party-a key ally in the erstwhile NDA Government, Jaitly's rise in Indian mainstream politics invited both awe and envy. But the going has been far from smooth. Trouble began with George Fernandes sacking Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat in 1998. Jaitly became the target. She was soon hounded by Tehelka's stings-first concerning her son-in-law-to-be Ajay Jadeja and then herself in an alleged bribery case. Eventually, Fernandes had to resign as India's Defence Minister, despite being the best, and Jaitly quit as the Samata Party President. Meanwhile, she spiritedly fought booth capturing in Bihar as well as fellow party men's egos, intervened and ensured the installation of the Samata government in Manipur. All this, even as she continued her parallel fight for the livelihood of craftsmen on the one hand, and conceptualized and ensured establishment of the first Dilli Haat (crafts market place) in 1994 on the other. With all the backstories of major events in Indian politics between 1970-2000, including her experience of dealing with the Commission of Inquiry and courts regarding the Tehelka stings, the story of Jaya Jaitly makes for a riveting read. A powerful narrative on why being a woman in politics was for her akin to being surrounded by scorpions; this hard hitting memoir offers a perspective on the functioning of Indian politics from a woman's point of view.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "8129149095"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9788129149091"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 308, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BpjWswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BpjWswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BpjWswEACAAJ&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BpjWswEACAAJ&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Life_Among_the_Scorpions.html?hl=&id=BpjWswEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BpjWswEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "With all the backstories of major events in Indian politics between 1970-2000, including her experience of dealing with the Commission of Inquiry and courts regarding the Tehelka stings, the story of Jaya Jaitly makes for a riveting read."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CtFaAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "+X0c0JNZOzo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CtFaAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Rise and Fall of National Women's Hospital", "subtitle": "A History", "authors": ["Linda Bryder"], "publisher": "Auckland University Press", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17", "description": "Natural childbirth and rooming-in; artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation; sterilisation and abortion: women's health and reproduction went through a revolution in the twentieth century as scientific advances confronted ethical and political dilemmas.

Established in Auckland in 1946, with a purpose-built building that opened in 1964, National Women's was the home of medical breakthroughs by Sir William (Bill) Liley and Sir Graham (Mont) Liggins; of the Lawson quintuplets and the 'glamorous gynaecologists'; and of scandals surrounding the so-called 'unfortunate experiment' and the neonatal chest physiotherapy inquiry. In this major history, Linda Bryder traces the evolution of National Women's in order to tell a wider story of reproductive health.

According to the Lien\u00fc zhuan, or Categorized Biographies of Women, it was not only appropriate but necessary for women to step in with wise counsel when fathers, husbands, or rulers strayed from the path of virtue. Compiled toward the end of the Former Han dynasty (202 BCE-9 CE) by Liu Xiang (79-8 BCE), the Lien\u00fc zhuan is the earliest extant book in the Chinese tradition solely devoted to the education of women. Far from providing a unified vision of women's roles, the text promotes a diverse and sometimes contradictory range of practices. At one extreme are exemplars resorting to suicide and self-mutilation as a means to preserve chastity and ritual orthodoxy. At the other are bold and outspoken women whose rhetorical mastery helps correct erring rulers, sons, and husbands. The text provides a fascinating overview of the representation of women's roles in early legends, formal speeches on statecraft, and highly fictionalized historical accounts during this foundational period of Chinese history. Over time, the biographies of women became a regular feature of dynastic and local histories and a vehicle for expressing and transmitting concerns about women's social, political, and domestic roles. The Lien\u00fc zhuan is also rich in information about the daily life, rituals, and domestic concerns of early China. Inspired by its accounts, artists across the millennia have depicted its stories on screens, paintings, lacquer ware, murals, and stone relief sculpture, extending its reach to literate and illiterate audiences alike.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231536080"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231536089"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.5.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=si2uAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=si2uAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=si2uAgAAQBAJ&pg=PR37&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=si2uAgAAQBAJ&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Exemplary_Women_of_Early_China.html?hl=&id=si2uAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Exemplary_Women_of_Early_China-sample-epub.acsm?id=si2uAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Exemplary_Women_of_Early_China-sample-pdf.acsm?id=si2uAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=si2uAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... as a plural marker and has thus led some translators to render the term <br>\nliezhuan as \u201c<b>biographies</b>\u201d or \u201c<b>memoirs</b>. ... of the Lien\u00fc zhuan in liu Xiang&#39;s <br>\nhanshu <b>biography</b>, Ban Gu also describes liu Xiang as gathering accounts of <br>\n<b>women</b>, which&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "GN7UgbL4kKoC", "etag": "HQ7/U60jtxk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GN7UgbL4kKoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Avant-garde", "subtitle": "War, Civilization, Modernity", "authors": ["Christine Froula"], "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "publishedDate": "2006-09-22", "description": "Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Avant-Garde traces the dynamic emergence of Woolf's art and thought against Bloomsbury's public thinking about Europe's future in a period marked by two world wars and rising threats of totalitarianism. Educated informally in her father's library and in Bloomsbury's London extension of Cambridge, Virginia Woolf came of age in the prewar decades, when progressive political and social movements gave hope that Europe \"might really be on the brink of becoming civilized,\" as Leonard Woolf put it. For pacifist Bloomsbury, heir to Europe's unfinished Enlightenment project of human rights, democratic self-governance, and world peace\u2014and, in E. M. Forster's words, \"the only genuine movement in English civilization\"\u2014 the 1914 \"civil war\" exposed barbarities within Europe: belligerent nationalisms, rapacious racialized economic imperialism, oppressive class and sex/gender systems, a tragic and unnecessary war that mobilized sixty-five million and left thirty-seven million casualties. An avant-garde in the twentieth-century struggle against the violence within European civilization, Bloomsbury and Woolf contributed richly to interwar debates on Europe's future at a moment when democracy's triumph over fascism and communism was by no means assured. Woolf honed her public voice in dialogue with contemporaries in and beyond Bloomsbury\u2014 John Maynard Keynes and Roger Fry to Sigmund Freud (published by the Woolfs'Hogarth Press), Bertrand Russell, T.

Women Writers in Postsocialist China introduces readers to a range and variety of contemporary Chinese women\u2019s writing, which has seen phenomenal growth in recent years. The book addresses the different ways women\u2019s issues are understood in China and the West, attending to the processes of translation, adaptation, and the grafting of new ideas with existing Chinese understandings of gender, feminism, subjectivity, consumerism and (post) modernism. By focusing on women\u2019s autobiographical, biographical, fictional and historical writing, the book engages in a transcultural flow of ideas between western and indigenous Chinese feminisms. Taking account of the accretions of social, cultural, geographic, literary, economic, and political movements and trends, cultural formations and ways of thinking, it asks how the texts and the concepts they negotiate might be understood in the social and cultural spaces within China and how they might be interpreted differently elsewhere in the global locations in which they circulate. The book argues that women-centred writing in China has a direct bearing on global feminist theory and practice.

On the twenty-fifth anniversary of 'Made in India', the breakout pop music video of the 1990s that captured the apna-time-aagaya zeitgeist of post-liberalization India and made him the nation's darling across genders and generations, Milind talks about his fascinating life-controversies, relationships, the breaking of vicious habits like smoking, alcohol, rage, and more-in a freewheeling, bare-all (easy, ladies-we're talking soul-wise!) memoir.

John Gielgud: Matinee Idol to Movie Star sees this peerless biographer return to his subject to offer the definitive life of Gielgud. For this new biography Croall's exhaustive research has included over a hundred new interviews with key people from his life and career, several hundred letters from Gielgud that have never been published, scores of letters written to him and archived versions of his film and television work. As Gielgud worked increasingly in this medium during the last third of his life much greater attention is given to this than in the earlier work. Fresh light is thrown on his professional relationships with figures such as Laurence Olivier and Edith Evans, and on turbulent episodes of his private life. The overall result is a a much more rounded, candid and richly textured portrait of this celebrated and complex actor.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781408131077"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1408131072"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 736, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "5.9.8.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&pg=PT661&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1953, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1953, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&rdid=book-Qy-M1O53kdYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1953000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1953000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/John_Gielgud_Matinee_Idol_to_Movie_Star-sample-epub.acsm?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/John_Gielgud_Matinee_Idol_to_Movie_Star-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "7 THE SEARCH FOR STARDOM <b>Memoir</b>: Dean, Seven Ages. <b>Biography</b>: <br>\nCoward/Hoare.

Merely Being There Is Not Enough theorizes the memoirs of Diane di Prima, Joyce Johnson, Hettie Jones, and Brenda Frazer, and analyzes their contributions to the Beat movement. Among the writings of female Beat authors, the memoir has become the most commonly used literary genre. At the height of the Beat movement, Frazer published Troia: Mexican Memoirs in 1969, the same year that saw the publication of di Prima's Memoirs of a Beatnik . Most female Beat voices, however, remained astonishingly silent until 1983, when Johnson published Minor Characters: A Young Woman's Coming of Age in the Beat Generation . Johnson's long-time friend Jones followed with How I Became Hettie Jones in 1990. The memoirs of Beat women chronicle the Beat-1950s and the intimate relationships with icons of the time: Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka, and Ray Bremser. Being there at a crucial moment in history validates female Beats' stories as indispensable social documents of the 1950s. To make women Beat writers visible and to categorize their memoirs, this work immerses in the almost paradoxical project of defining a category of female Beat writing when it is the nature of Beat literature and its rebellious aesthetics to dismiss any kind of labeling. Women Beats unsettle the categories of Beat writing and culture: Therefore, a revision and re-examination of Beat history is inevitable to understand the movement's literary expression.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781599426563"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1599426560"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 196, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4a44_d61kFoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4a44_d61kFoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4a44_d61kFoC&pg=PA1&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=61&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4a44_d61kFoC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4a44_d61kFoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1499.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 749.58, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4a44_d61kFoC&rdid=book-4a44_d61kFoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1499160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 749580000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Merely_Being_There_Is_Not_Enough-sample-epub.acsm?id=4a44_d61kFoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Merely_Being_There_Is_Not_Enough-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4a44_d61kFoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4a44_d61kFoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Some critics go as far as to call the explosion of intimate, highly confessional <br>\n<b>women&#39;s memoirs</b> an intellectual fraud, ...

Her ideas inspired a number of works addressing the role of the family in producing social change and discussing women's unique capacity for promoting peace through nurturing and networking. Boulding\u2019s additional ideas on transnational networks and their relationship to global understanding are considered seminal contributions to modern peace studies and have earned her the title of \u201cmatriarch\u201d of the 20th century peace movement. This biography is divided into three parts. The first and third deal chronologically with the life of Elise Boulding, beginning with her childhood experiences as a Scandinavian immigrant. The 1940 Nazi invasion of Norway significantly influenced her concepts of pacifism and Quaker spiritualism, laying the foundation for her future work as a leader in the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom and her dynamic professional partnership with and marriage to the internationally known Quaker economist and poet Kenneth Boulding. Part Two expounds upon Boulding\u2019s philosophy of education, her role as a member of the Religious Society of Friends, her espousal of the conceptual evolution of cultures of peace, and her theoretical work in women\u2019s studies and peace research. In recognition of these achievements, Boulding has been the recipient of more than 19 awards and was a 1990 nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780786482368"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0786482362"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 238, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC&pg=PA1&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2113.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2113.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC&rdid=book-lUEZ4C6K_LMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2113090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2113090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Elise_Boulding-sample-pdf.acsm?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lUEZ4C6K_LMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "One of the by-products of the new wave of feminism in the second half of the <br>\ntwentieth century was a flood of <b>biographies</b>, <b>autobiographies</b>, and <b>memoirs</b> by <br>\nand about <b>women</b>, followed by new thinking about the nature of these genres <br>\nand&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FsKLBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "ypeNLhfIsnU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FsKLBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Neglected Canon: Nine Women Philosophers", "subtitle": "First to the Twentieth Century", "authors": ["T.

She holds The Hero's hand as he runs through the Pyramids, chasing robots. Or she nags him, or foils him, plays the uptight straight man to his charming loser. She's idealised, degraded, dismissed, objectified and almost always dehumanised. How do we process these insidious portrayals, and how do they shape our sense of who we are and what we can become? Part memoir, part cultural commentary, part call to arms to women everywhere, You Play The Girl flips the perspective on the past thirty-five years in pop culture - from the progressive 70s, through the backlash 80s, the triumphalist 90s and the pornified 'bro culture' of the early twenty-first century - providing a firsthand chronicle of the experience of growing up inside this funhouse. Always incisive, Chocano brilliantly shows that our identities are more iterative than we think, and certainly more complex than anything we see on any kind of screen.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780349005560"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0349005567"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 896.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 448.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2_jcCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 896800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 448400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/You_Play_The_Girl-sample-epub.acsm?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2_jcCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&#39;Carina Chocano blew my mind. . .

What can this tell us about how they viewed themselves as men and how they understood masculinity? How did their attitudes in turn shape the martial heroes and other masculine models they constructed? Martin Huang attempts to answer these questions in this valuable work on manhood in late imperial China. He focuses on the ambivalent and often paradoxical role played by women and the feminine in the intricate negotiating process of male gender identity in late imperial cultural discourses. Two common strategies for constructing and negotiating masculinity were adopted in many of the works examined here. The first, what Huang calls the strategy of analogy, constructs masculinity in close association with the feminine; the second, the strategy of differentiation, defines it in sharp contrast to the feminine. In both cases women bear the burden as the defining \"other.\" In this study, \"feminine\" is a rather broad concept denoting a wide range of gender phenomena associated with women, from the politically and socially destabilizing to the exemplary wives and daughters celebrated in Confucian chastity discourse.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0824828968"},

Here is a panoramic view of African American life, rich in gripping first-person accounts and short character sketches that invite readers to relive history as African Americans experienced it. We begin in Africa, with the growth of the slave trade, and follow the forced migration of what is estimated to be between ten and twenty million people, witnessing the terrible human cost of slavery in the colonies of England and Spain. We read of the Haitian Revolution, which ended victoriously in 1804 with the birth of the first independent black nation in the New World, and of slave rebellions and resistance in the United States in the years leading up to the Civil War.

On a hot August night on Cape Cod, when Adrienne was 14, her mother Malabar woke her at midnight with five simple words that would set the course of both of their lives for years to come: Ben Souther just kissed me. Adrienne instantly became her mother\u2019s confidante and helpmate, blossoming in the sudden light of her attention; from then on, Malabar came to rely on her daughter to help orchestrate what would become an epic affair with her husband\u2019s closest friend. The affair would have calamitous consequences for everyone involved, impacting Adrienne\u2019s life in profound ways, driving her into a doomed marriage of her own, and then into a deep depression. Only years later will she find the strength to embrace her life -- and her mother -- on her own terms. This is a book about how the people close to us can break our hearts simply because they have access to them. It's about the lies we tell in order to justify the choices we make. It\u2019s about mothers and daughters and the nature of family.

Beginning with the writing of autobiographies by historians, the volume then turns to biographical studies, both of historians whose writings were in some sense nation-defining and those who may be regarded as having had a major influence on defining the discipline of history. The final section explores elements of collective biography, linking these to the formation of historical networks. A concluding essay by Barbara Caine offers a critical appraisal of the study of historians\u2019 biographies and autobiographies to date, and maps out likely new directions for future work. Clio\u2019s Lives is a very good scholarly collection that advances the study of autobiography and biography within the writing of history itself, taking theoretical questions in significant new directions. The contributors are well known and highly respected in the history profession and write with an insight and intellectual energy that will ensure the book has considerable impact. They examine cutting-edge issues about the writing of history at the personal level through autobiography and biography in diverse and innovative ways. Together the writers have provided reflective chapters that will be widely read for their impressive theoretical advances as well as being inspirational for new entrants to the disciplinary area. \u2014 Patricia Grimshaw, University of Melbourne Clio\u2019s Lives brings together a most interesting and varied cast of contributors. Its chapters contain sophisticated and well-penned ruminations on the uses of biography and autobiography among historians. These are clearly connected with the general themes of the volume.

Poetry depends on intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor...' In these two classic essays of feminist literature, Woolf argues passionately for women's intellectual freedom and their role in challenging the drive towards fascism and conflict. In A Room of One's Own she explores centuries of limitations placed on women, as well as celebrating the creative achievements of the women writers who overcame these obstacles. In this first history of women's writing, she describes the importance of education, financial independence, and equality of opportunity to creative freedom. Three Guineas was written under the threat of fascism and impending war. A radical articulation of Woolf's pacifist politics, it investigates the causes of gender inequalities and the ways in which women's historic outsider position make them crucial in the prevention of war. Both these works started life as talks to groups of young women, and their engaging wit and informality establish Woolf as one of the twentieth-century's greatest essayists. Their arguments continue to reverberate in feminist discourse to this day.

In the first section, in nine essays that cover the Arab Middle East from Morocco to Iraq and Syria to Yemen, critics and writers from the Arab world examine the origin and evolution of women's writing in each country in the region, addressing fiction, poetry, drama, and autobiographical writing. The second part of the volume contains bibliographical entries for over 1,200 Arab women writers from the last third of the nineteenth century through 1999. Each entry contains a short biography and a bibliography of each author's published works. This section also includes Arab women's writing in French and English, as well as a bibliography of works translated into English. With its broad scope and extensive research, this book is an indispensable resource for anyone interested in Arabic literature, women's studies, or comparative literature.

Throughout this century, Albania has been perceived as primitive and isolationist by its neighbors to the west. When the country ended fifty years of communist rule in 1992, few outsiders took interest. Deemed unworthy of membership in the European Union and overlooked by multinational corporations, Albania stands today as one of the poorest and most ignored countries in Europe. Miranda Vickers and James Pettifer take us behind the veil of former President Enver Hoxha's isolationist policies to examine the historic events leading up to Albania's transition to a parliamentary government. Beginning with Hoxha's death in 1985, Albania traces the last decade of Albania's shaky existence, from the anarchy and chaos of the early nineties to the victory of the Democratic Alliance in 1992 and the programs of the current government. The authors provide us with an analysis of how the moral, religious, economic, political and cultural identity of the Albanian people is being redefined, and leave no question that the future of Albania is inextricably linked to the future of the Balkans as a whole.
