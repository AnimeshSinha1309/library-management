She asks general questions as to the nature of artistic interpretation, the differences between virtuosity and artistry, and how artists interplay with audience, aesthetics, and style. To support her case, she examines artists as diverse as Fokine and the Ballets Russes, Tewa Indian dancers, 17th century commedia dell'arte, Japanese kabuki and butoh, Zapotec shamans, and the mime of Marcel Marceau, adding her own observations as a professional dancer in the classical ballet tradition. Royce also points to the recent move toward collaboration across artistic genres as evidence of the universality of aesthetics. Her analysis leads to a better understanding of artistic interpretation, artist-audience relationships, and the artistic imagination as cross-cultural phenomena. Over 29 black and white photographs and drawings illustrate the wide range of Royce's cross-cultural approach. Her well-crafted volume will be of great interest to anthropologists, arts researchers, and students of cultural studies and performing arts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0759102244"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780759102248"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 260, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.3.3.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Anthropology_of_the_Performing_Arts.html?hl=&id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Anthropology_of_the_Performing_Arts-sample-pdf.acsm?id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Anya Peterson Royce turns the anthropological gaze on the performing arts, attempting to find broad commonalities in performance, art, and artists across space, time, and culture."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "e2DjnGZAcXMC", "etag": "teg1U9JDvp8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/e2DjnGZAcXMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Buildings for the Performing Arts", "authors": ["Ian Appleton"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2012-05-31", "description": "This Design and Development Guide is an essential book for those who are involved in the initiation, planning, design and building of facilities for the various performing arts, from local to metropolitan locations.

Ideal reading for visitors to the island as well as for anyone interested in Balinese culture, the book presents the history and function of each performance genre, with illustrations and photographs to aid in identification. Introductory sections discuss the way performing arts are learned in Bali and the basic Balinese values which are passed on in these forms, as well as some of the basic religious and cultural tenets that are expressed in the arts and the functions of the forms themselves. Different sections describe particular forms of performing arts, such as Gong Angklung, Legong, the Keraton dance, Wayang Kulit, and the new phenomenon of women's gamelan groups, the evolution of each and the place it has in the culture of Bali.

Studying the life-experiences of six artists, and their unique engagement with three art forms \u2014 music, drama and dance \u2014 the book highlights the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual effects of performing arts both on the performers and the audience. More importantly, it takes the current understanding of the therapeutic role of arts beyond a deficit model of health that focuses on their use in curing illnesses, disabilities and imbalances, towards a more positive growth-centric model that relates them to promoting holistic mental health, well-being and happiness. It thus bridges the gap between the theoretical understanding of creative arts therapy and the practical experience of performing arts in non-therapeutic settings. Further, it assumes increasing relevance with respect to fast-changing lifestyles to which stress and ill-health are often attributed.

Correspondingly the fields of drama, film, music, opera, dance and performance studies are expanding. However, these arts remain an underexplored territory for aesthetics and the philosophy of art. Expression in the Performing Arts tries to contribute to this area. The volume collects essays written by international scholars who address a variety of themes concerning the core philosophical topic of expression in the theory of the performing arts. Specific questions about the ontology of art, the nature of the performances, the role of the performer, and the relations between spectators and works emerge from the study of the performing arts. Besides, these arts challenge the unchanging physicality of other kinds of works of art, usually the direct result of creative individual artist, and barely affected by the particular circumstances of their exhibition. Expression is one of the issues that adopt a special character in the performing arts. Do singers, dancers or actors express the feelings a work is expressive of? How does the performer contribute to the expressive content of the work? How does the spectator emotionally respond to the physical proximity of the performers? Is aesthetic distance avoided in the understanding of the performing arts? How are the expressive properties of work, performance and characters related? And how are the subjectivities they embody revealed? The contributions presented here are not all in agreement on the right answers to theses questions, but they offer a critical and exciting discussion of them. In addition to original proposals on the theoretical aspect of expression in the performing arts, the collection includes analyses of individual artists, historical productions and concrete works of art, as well as reflections on performative practice.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781443820240"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1443820245"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 305, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5940.67, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5940.67, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FUcaBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5940670000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5940670000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Expression_in_the_Performing_Arts-sample-pdf.acsm?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FUcaBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The complex nature of the <b>performing arts</b> demands multiple levels of <br>\nphilosophical attention.

It contains essays evaluating the role of refugee artists in the BBC German Service, including the actor Martin Miller, the writer Bruno Adler and the journalist Edmund Wolf. Miller also made a career in the English theatre transcending the barrier of Language, as did the actor Gerhard Hinze, whose transition to the English stage is an instructive example of adaptation to a new theatre culture. In film, Language problems were mitigated by the technical possibilities of the medium, although stars like Anton Walbrook received coaching in English. Certainly, technicians from Central Europe, like the cameraman Wolf Suschitzky, helped establish the character of British film in the 1950s and 1960s. In dance theatre, Language played little role, facilitating the influence in Britain of dance practitioners like Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder.

What is the role of undead creatures like zombies and vampires in mythological films? Looking across the millennia, from the distrust of ancient magic and oriental cults, which threatened the new-born Christian religion, to the revival and adaptation of ancient myths and religion in the arts centuries later, this book offers an original analysis of the reception of ancient magic and the supernatural, across a wide variety of different media \u2013 from comics to film, from painting to opera. Working in a variety of fields across the globe, the authors of these essays deconstruct certain scholarly traditions by proposing original interdisciplinary approaches and collaborations, showing to what extent the visual and performing arts of different periods interlink and shape cultural and social identities.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472532213"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "147253221X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Body, Mind & Spirit"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.3.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2790, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2790, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-oSlfBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2790000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2790000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ancient_Magic_and_the_Supernatural_in_th-sample-epub.acsm?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ancient_Magic_and_the_Supernatural_in_th-sample-pdf.acsm?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oSlfBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Irene Berti and Filippo Carl\u00e0 Since its foundation in 2007, the international <br>\nresearch group &#39;Imagines: Antiquity in the Visual and <b>Performing Arts</b>&#39;

This collection of essays reveals a deep alliance between architecture and the performing arts, uncovering its roots in ancient stories, and tracing a continuous tradition of thought that emerges in contemporary practice. With fresh insight, the authors ask how buildings perform with people as partners, rather than how they look as formal compositions. They focus on actions: the door that offers the possibility of making a dramatic entrance, the window that frames a scene, and the city street that is transformed in carnival. The essays also consider the design process as a performance improvised among many players and offer examples of recent practice that integrates theater and dance. This collection advances architectural theory, history, and criticism by proposing the lens of performance as a way to engage the multiple roles that buildings can play, without reducing them to functional categories. By casting architecture as spatial action rather than as static form, these essays open a promising avenue for future investigation. For architects, the essays propose integrating performance into design through playful explorations that can reveal intense relationships between people and place, and among people in place. Such practices develop an architectural imagination that intuitively asks, 'How might people play out their stories in this place?' and 'How might this place spark new stories?' Questions such as these reside in the heart of all of the essays presented here. Together, they open a position in the intersection between everyday life and staged performance to rethink the role of architectural design.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier":

Societies is a detailed exploration of genre development within the fields of dance, theatre, and opera in selected European countries during the decades before and after 1800. An introductory chapter outlines the theoretical and ideological background of genre thinking in Europe, starting from antiquity. A further fourteen chapters cover the performing genres as they developed in England, France, Germany, and Austria, and follow the dissemination and adaptation of the corresponding genres in minor and major cities in the Nordic countries. With a strong emphasis on the role that pragmatic and contextual factors had in defining genres, the book examines such subjects as the dancing masters in Christiania (Oslo), circa 1800, the repertory and travels of an itinerant acrobat and his wife in Norway in the 1760s, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas on bourgeois drama in Denmark. Including detailed analyses in the light of material, political, and social factors, this is a valuable resource for scholars and researchers in the fields of musicology, opera studies, and theatre and performance studies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781000055665"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1000055663"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 234, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4066.77, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4066.77, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0YbiDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4066770000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4066770000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Performing_Arts_in_Changing_Societies-sample-epub.acsm?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Performing_Arts_in_Changing_Societies-sample-pdf.acsm?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0YbiDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Including detailed analyses in the light of material, political, and social factors, this is a valuable resource for scholars and researchers in the fields of musicology, opera studies, and theatre and performance studies."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8FklDgAAQBAJ", "etag": "8AKzNYEAt8c", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8FklDgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Theater Planning", "subtitle": "Facilities for Performing Arts and Live Entertainment", "authors": ["Gene Leitermann"], "publisher": "Taylor & Francis", "publishedDate": "2017-02-17", "description": "This book introduces theater planning to students and practitioners of each field, and provides a detailed guide to the process and the technical requirements particular to theater buildings.

Focusing primarily on four plays, this textbook aims to inform the student about theatre arts, stimulate interest in the art form, lead to critical thinking about theatre, and prepare the student to be a more informed and critical theatregoer. The four plays central to this book are the tragedy Macbeth, the landmark African American drama A Raisin in the Sun, the American comedy classic You Can\u2019t Take It with You, and\u2014new to this edition\u2014the contemporary hip-hop musical Hamilton. At the beginning of the text, each play is described with plot synopses (and suggested video versions), and then these four representative works are referred to throughout the book. In addition to looking at both the theoretical and practical aspects of theatre arts\u2014from the nature of theatre and drama to how it reflects society\u2014the author also explains the processes that playwrights, actors, designers, directors, producers, and critics go through. In addition to Hamilton, this edition includes full color images throughout, as well as revised chapters and expanded and updated material on the technical aspects of theatre, coverage of children\u2019s theatre and British theatre, the role of drama as therapy, and the importance of diversity in theatre today. Structured into ten chapters, each looking at a major area or artist\u2014and concluding with the audience and critics\u2014the unique approach of Theatre as Human Action thoroughly addresses all of the major topics to be found in an introduction to theatre text.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781538126431"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1538126435"}],

Sarason"], "publisher": "Teachers College Press", "publishedDate": "1999", "description": "In his most recent work and with his usual perceptiveness, Seymour Sarason probes the topic of teaching as a performing art. Refreshingly, Dr. Sarason focuses on the often-overlooked role of teachers in galvanizing an audience\u2014their students. Sarason argues that teachers will better engage learners if they are prepared in the artistry of doing so. Sarason sees teachers as actors and thus uses the traditions of stage performance to inspire ways to foster connections between teachers and students. Sarason elucidates how the rehearsal processes actors undergo and the direction they receive, for example, would be similarly beneficial for educators. Recognizing that implementing his ideas would require a profound rethinking of teacher training programs, Sarason urges why they are crucial to excellence in education. As always, Sarason\u2019s writing is rich with insight garnered from 45 years of teaching and a lifetime devotion to educational issues. His book is essential for teachers and teacher educators and an excellent resource for anyone interested in educational topics. \u201cOnce again, Sarason, like other great teachers and artists, has us pause at the moral center of what we thought we knew long enough to recognize truths we might otherwise neglect. Just as he guided our understanding of school cultures and school reform, this book reshapes what we previously thought of as \u2018the art of teaching\u2019.\u201d \u2014Jeannie Oakes, Professor of Education at University of California, Los Angeles \u201cSeymour Sarason thinks he has something new to say. Indeed, he has. Furthermore, he writes about a domain anyone who has taught in educational institutions identifies with immediately but is almost barren of attention. There are insight, great writing, and passion here, but don\u2019t look for a repetition of anything Sarason has written before. To the thousands of psychologists, sociologists, and teachers of teachers already nourished by Sarason\u2019s writing, this book will add the audience of teachers in and out of schools that he has always wanted to reach.\u201d \u2014John Goodlad, Co-director, Center for Educational Renewal, University of Washington, and President, Institute for Educational Inquiry", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780807774960"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0807774960"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 171, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2111.98, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2111.98, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-4iNeDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2111980000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2111980000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Teaching_as_a_Performing_Art-sample-epub.acsm?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Teaching_as_a_Performing_Art-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4iNeDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "To the thousands of psychologists, sociologists, and teachers of teachers already nourished by Sarason\u2019s writing, this book will add the audience of teachers in and out of schools that he has always wanted to reach.\u201d \u2014John Goodlad, Co ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HEjWDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "a7nfdQmxg+s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HEjWDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Teaching with Confidence in Higher Education", "subtitle": "Applying Strategies from the Performing Arts", "authors": ["Richard Bale"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2020-04-01", "description": "Presenting higher education teaching as a performative, creative, and improvisational activity, Teaching with Confidence in Higher Education explores how skills and techniques from the performing arts can be used to increase the confidence and enhance the performance of teachers.

Performing Arts", "authors": ["David Rom\u00e1n", "Paula Court", "Richard Termine"], "publisher": "Duke University Press Books", "publishedDate": "2005-11-23", "description": "Performance in America demonstrates the vital importance of the performing arts to contemporary U.S. culture. Looking at a series of specific performances mounted between 1994 and 2004, well-known performance studies scholar David Rom\u00e1n challenges the belief that theatre, dance, and live music are marginal art forms in the United States. He describes the crucial role that the performing arts play in local, regional, and national communities, emphasizing the power of live performance, particularly its immediacy and capacity to create a dialogue between artists and audiences. Rom\u00e1n draws attention to the ways that the performing arts provide unique perspectives on many of the most pressing concerns within American studies: questions about history and politics, citizenship and society, and culture and nation. The performances that Rom\u00e1n analyzes range from localized community-based arts events to full-scale Broadway productions and from the controversial works of established artists such as Tony Kushner to those of emerging artists. Rom\u00e1n considers dances produced by the choreographers Bill T. Jones and Neil Greenberg in the mid-1990s as new aids treatments became available and the aids crisis was reconfigured; a production of the Asian American playwright Chay Yew\u2019s A Beautiful Country in a high-school auditorium in Los Angeles\u2019s Chinatown; and Latino performer John Leguizamo\u2019s one-man Broadway show Freak. He examines the revival of theatrical legacies by female impersonators and the resurgence of cabaret in New York City. Rom\u00e1n also looks at how the performing arts have responded to 9/11, the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and the second war in Iraq. Including more than eighty illustrations, Performance in America highlights the dynamic relationships among performance, history, and contemporary culture through which the past is revisited and the future reimagined.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0822336634"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780822336631"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 376, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZYoNmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZYoNmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZYoNmAEACAAJ&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZYoNmAEACAAJ&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Performance_in_America.html?hl=&id=ZYoNmAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZYoNmAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The performances that Rom\u00e1n analyzes range from localized community-based arts events to full-scale Broadway productions and from the controversial works of established artists such as Tony Kushner to those of emerging artists."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "7ypQDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "ebA6eepUXt4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7ypQDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cambridge Technicals Level 3 Performing Arts", "authors": ["Mark Lewinski", "Sam Parrish", "David Porter", "Hannah Thomas"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2016-11-08", "description": "Exam Board: Cambridge Level: KS4 Subject: Performing Arts First Teaching: September 2016 First Exam: June 2017 Support your teaching of the new Cambridge Technicals 2016 suite with Cambridge Technical Level 3 Performing Arts, developed in partnership between OCR and Hodder Education; this textbook covers each specialist pathway and ensures your ability to deliver a flexible course that is both vocationally focused and academically thorough.

Even our Paleolithic forebears engaged in story-telling and music-making; bone flutes more than 35,000 years old have been found. That these instincts evolved into the works of Euripides and Shakespeare, Bach and Beethoven, is one of civilization's great achievements. Yet performing arts companies today, which present both classic and contemporary works for live audiences, face business challenges at least as great as any other industry. There are about 9,000 performing arts companies in America, generating about $14 billion in revenue according to the last economic census (2007).The industry is fragmented: 77% of the companies have revenues of less than $1 million, only 3% exceed $10 million, and the 20 largest companies account for only 20% of industry revenue. There are two distinct sectors that differ by genre, mission, and tax status: for-profit companies, accounting for $8 billion of industry revenue, and not-for-profits, accounting for $6 billion. This book will give lovers of the performing arts an understanding of the backstage realities that make live performances possible. Prospective board members, managers, and performers will be better equipped to take on the challenges their companies face. Business analysts and students will discover how well economic and managerial frameworks apply in this unique setting where culture and commerce converge.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "160649564X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781606495643"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 282, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4qQynwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4qQynwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4qQynwEACAAJ&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4qQynwEACAAJ&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Profile_of_the_Performing_Arts_Industr.html?hl=&id=4qQynwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4qQynwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book will give lovers of the performing arts an understanding of the backstage realities that make live performances possible."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tml2DwAAQBAJ", "etag": "INCWtFLy0YQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tml2DwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Improvisation in the Expressive and Performing Arts", "subtitle": "eBook", "authors": ["Beliz Demircioglu"], "publisher": "Jessica Kingsley Publishers", "publishedDate": "2019-02-21", "description": "This book explores the process of improvisation and outlines the ideal conditions for an inspirational creative state.

Since then, people have become more spontaneous in purchasing tickets and increasingly prefer selecting specific programs to attend rather than buying a subscription series. Arts attenders also expect more responsive customer service than ever before. Because of these and other factors, many audience development strategies that sustained nonprofit arts organizations in the past are no longer dependable and performing arts marketers face many new challenges in their efforts to build and retain their audiences. Arts organizations must learn how to be relevant to the changing lifestyles, needs, interests, and preferences of their current and potential audiences. Arts Marketing Insights offers managers, board members, professors, and students of arts management the ideas and information they need to market effectively and efficiently to customers today and into the future. In this book, Joanne Scheff Bernstein helps readers to understand performing arts audiences, conduct research, and provide excellent customer service.

Exploring the role that theatre artists play \u2014 from the actor and director to the designer and puppet-master, as well as the audience \u2014 this is an engaging exploration of what theatre has meant, and still means, to people of all ages at all times.

Although this fact is widely known and referenced, most scholarly works in the performing arts so far have either focused on \"music\" or \"dance\" rather than treating the two in combination. The authors in this book look at both aspects in performance, moreover, they focus explicitly on the interrelation between the two, on both descriptive-analytical and metaphorical levels. The book includes diverse examples of regional performing art genres from Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. All case studies are composed from the perspective of the relatively new approach and field of ethno-choreomusicology.

We present relevant aspects of Binder\u2019s approach as precisely as possible, then take Binder\u2019s approach for granted to tease out the implications of that approach to the issues of theatre, including nostalgia, intercultural theatre, theatre criticism, dealing with demanding roles, the canon, theatre and philosophy, digital performance, practice as research, and applied theatre. Overall, the book proposes an overarching emphasis on the importance of living in the present and the concomitant need to abandon obsolete but still powerful patterns of the past. In this context, theatre, according to Binder, has a global responsibility for the new world in which humans are liberated from the scourge of the past. Theatre has the power and thus the responsibility to be path-breaking for a new \u201cfiction\u201d, to show to people, in a playful and creative manner, the direction in which the new consciousness can move. Daniel Meyer-Dinkgr\u00e4fe is Professor of Drama at the Lincoln School of Performing Arts, University of Lincoln.

Beginning her affair with the camera when she was four, this doe-eyed beauty conquered Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada industries with performances etched in gold. Taking Hindi cinema by storm with Himmatwala in 1983, Sridevi emerged as one of the most iconic screen goddesses of India, playing characters that became cultural touchstones. Besides reigning as Queen Bee for the longest spell among Bollywood heroines, she also remains the only actress who was, at the same time, No.1 in Tamil and Telugu cinema too. Such was Sridevi's pan-India stardom that in a patriarchal industry, she emerged as the 'hero' at the box-office, towering above her male co-actors. After a hiatus of fifteen years, she shattered the rules again by becoming the only Bollywood diva to make a glorious comeback in 2012 with English Vinglish. A supremely gifted actor-her comedy peerless, her dances legendary, her histrionics awe-inspiring-she offered a study in contrast in real life. If her life played out forever in the limelight, so did her sudden demise in 2018. Charting five decades of her larger-than-life magic, Sridevi: The Eternal Screen Goddess celebrates both the phenomenon and the person.

The book begins with a chapter about creativity, habitual behavior, and transformation. The chapters that follow explore the mind-body relationship, introduce the Alexander Technique and its major principles, and provide strategies for embodying and practicing the work. Readers are challenged to explore basic procedures, including Body Mapping and breath work, in order to heighten awareness and increase safety and efficiency. In later chapters, actors, musicians, and dancers learn how they can benefit from the Alexander Technique. The closing chapter describes how readers can continue to develop their skills as they apply the Alexander Technique in their daily life. Moving Meditation is a critical resource that teaches performing arts students how to deepen their creativity, care for themselves, and practice daily intentionality. It is suitable for courses and programs spanning all areas of the performing and creative arts, as well as courses in communication and healthcare. Ellen Melamed is an artist-in-residence in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Arizona, where she teaches the Alexander Technique. At the UA College of Medicine, she is a lecturer in family and community medicine, director of the Medical Humanities program, and teaches narrative medicine to medical students at the UA Poetry Center. She holds a M.A. in theatre education from Teachers College, Columbia University. Melamed's work aims to bridge the divides between practitioners, patients, and caregivers by exploring how performing and visual arts can encourage compassionate communication in healthcare. She has taught the Alexander Technique for more than 25 years and currently has a private practice in Tucson, Arizona.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1516570006"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781516570003"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 174, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZcQgugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZcQgugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZcQgugEACAAJ&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZcQgugEACAAJ&dq=Performing+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Moving_Meditation.html?hl=&id=ZcQgugEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZcQgugEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book begins with a chapter about creativity, habitual behavior, and transformation."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rsNiDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "EQNZR4WvQXU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rsNiDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Curating Live Arts", "subtitle": "Critical Perspectives, Essays, and Conversations on Theory and Practice", "authors": ["Dena Davida", "Marc Pronovost", "V\u00e9ronique Hudon", "Jane Gabriels"], "publisher": "Berghahn Books", "publishedDate": "2018-11-29", "description": "Situated at the crossroads of performance practice, museology, and cultural studies, live arts curation has grown in recent years to become a vibrant interdisciplinary project and a genuine global phenomenon.
