Identifying what we know inevitably reveals what we do not know about such fluctuations as well. From the vantage point of where the conference's participants view our current understanding to be, these proceedings can be seen as suggesting an agenda for further research. The conference was divided into five sections. It began with the formu lation of an empirical definition of the \"business cycle\" and a recitation of the stylized facts that must be explained by any theory that purports to capture the business cycle's essence. After outlining the historical develop ment and key features of the current \"theories\" of business cycles, the conference evaluated these theories on the basis of their ability to explain the facts. Included in this evaluation was a discussion of whether (and how) the competing theories could be distinguished empirically. The conference then examined the implications for policy of what is known and not known about business cycles. A panel discussion closed the conference, high lighting important unresolved theoretical and empirical issues that should be taken up in future business cycle research. What Is a Business Cycle?

IFIP's mission is to be the leading, truly international, apolitical organization which encourages and assists in the development, exploitation and application of Information Technology for the benefit of all people. At the heart of IFIP lie its Technical Committees that, between them, count on the active participation of some two thousand people world-wide. These Groups work in a variety of ways to share experience and to develop their specialised knowledge. Technical Committees include: TC 1. Foundations of Computer Science; TC 2: Software: Theory and Practice; TC 3: Education; TC 6: Communication Systems; TC 7: System Modelling and Optimization; TC 9: Relationship between Computers and Society; TC 11: Security and Protection in Information Processing Systems; TC 12: Artificial Intelligence and TC 13: Human-Computer Interaction.

EBCR combines economic theory and measurement in the study of business cycles, i.e., ups and downs in overall economic activity. We assess four methods of EBCR: business cycle indicators, simultaneous equations models, vector autoregressive systems and real business indicators. After a sketch of the history of the methods, we investigate whether the methods meet the goals of EBCR: the three traditional ones, description, forecasting and policy evaluation, and the one Tinbergen introduced, the implementation|testing of business cycles. The first three EBCR methods are illustrated for the Netherlands, a typical example of a small, open economy. The main conclusion of the book is that simultaneous equation models are the best vehicle for EBCR, if all its goals are to be attained simultaneously. This conclusion is based on a fairly detailed assessment of the methods and is not over-turned in the empirical illustrations. The main conclusion does not imply the end of other EBCR methods. Not all goals have to be met with a single vehicle, other methods might serve the purpose equally well - or even better. For example, if one is interested in business cycle forecasts, one might prefer a business cycle indicator or vector autoregressive system. A second conclusion is that many ideas/concepts that play an important role in current discussions about econometric methodology in general and EBCR in particular, were put forward in the 1930s and 1940s. A third conclusion is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to compare the outcomes of RBC models to outcomes of the other three methods, because RBC modellers are not interested in modelling business cycles on an observation-per-observation basis. A more general conclusion in this respect is that methods should adopt the same concept of business cycles to make them comparable.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0792382544"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780792382546"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 228, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SKIFOSc5stgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SKIFOSc5stgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SKIFOSc5stgC&pg=PA29&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SKIFOSc5stgC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Econometric_Business_Cycle_Research.html?hl=&id=SKIFOSc5stgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Econometric_Business_Cycle_Research-sample-epub.acsm?id=SKIFOSc5stgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Econometric_Business_Cycle_Research-sample-pdf.acsm?id=SKIFOSc5stgC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SKIFOSc5stgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_ZQrdZ17zeQC", "etag": "gJkjKJDIicw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_ZQrdZ17zeQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Emerging Issues and Challenges in Business & Economics: Selected Contributions from the 8th Global Conference", "authors": ["Francesco Ciampi"], "publisher": "Firenze University Press", "publishedDate": "2009", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9788864530598"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "8864530592"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 606, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ZQrdZ17zeQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ZQrdZ17zeQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_ZQrdZ17zeQC&pg=PA361&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_ZQrdZ17zeQC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Emerging_Issues_and_Challenges_in_Busine.html?hl=&id=_ZQrdZ17zeQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_ZQrdZ17zeQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "RiQdbKltHbQC", "etag": "g+KvnMQHVyk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RiQdbKltHbQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Business Intelligence Techniques", "subtitle": "A Perspective from Accounting and Finance", "authors": ["Murugan Anandarajan", "Asokan Anandarajan", "Cadambi A.

One also recognizes that delving into a topic as such is rather challenging as it is a multidimensional task. We have learned quite a bit on the innovation-growth relationship of the dev- oped countries based on the extensive research on the topic. However, we are yet to understand the very same process for the developing countries where the challenges are expected to be paramount. There obviously is few empirical and theoretical discussion on this topic. This book dares to provide a succinct discussion on a wide array of issues on the innovation and growth relationship for the developing countries. The book starts off by providing the reader with a promising - ternative to endogenous growth models that entails understanding the effect of variables, such as technological change on growth in cons- erable detail. The next step in the book involves a thorough analysis of economic growth models and how the investment climate affects innovationand entrepreneurship and hence economic growth. Against this background is examined the context of the telecommunications industry in Turkey. Following this, we delve into understanding the radical versusincremental innovationactivities,where itis argued that developing nations are more likely to engage in radical innovation, whereas developing nations are engaged in incremental innovation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780387799766"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0387799761"}],

At the same time, the pressing concern for improving the quality of higher education has led to a definite need for more knowledge about effective instruction and innovation in economics and business education. The book brings together many examples of reform in economics and business education. Special attention is paid to the problem-based learning approach, which over the past ten years, has developed as a very important innovation in higher education. The book contains contributions from a variety of institutions on the necessity of curriculum reform, the choice of instructional methods, assessment and testing, and management of change.

In contrast to the typical business ethics book written primarily from the viewpoint of Western culture and economy, the majority of the work is by Asian scholars, providing an historical overview of the religious, scientific and cultural phenomena which converged to create modern Japanese business ethics. Perspectives from socioeconomics, sociology, social contract and applied business ethics contribute to the analysis of moral issues. A new Japanese approach to moral science, Moralogy, is introduced and its implications for phenomena such as the Keiretsu system are explored. Concurrently, prominent Western ethicists explore the role of moral language and the implications of Kantian ethics and contractarian approaches for developing universal moral standards. Because Japan is an economic superpower, it is critical to understand the hidden economic culture, work ethic, and way of thinking in business. We must realize these are the results of an integration of historical factors, such as Shintoism, Buddhism, Confuctianism and modern Western science and technology. Business Ethics: Japan and the Global Economy provides philosophical and anthropological analyses of the Japanese economic mind, departing from previous stereotyped approaches. Theoretical discussions based upon social contract theory are presented in order to build ethical norms with cross-cultural activity for multinational economic activities. From such a universal stance, practical proposals are presented to transnationalize the Keiretsu system and other Japanese economic institutions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0792324277"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780792324270"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 275, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NnA2mt6Zf88C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NnA2mt6Zf88C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NnA2mt6Zf88C&pg=PA23&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NnA2mt6Zf88C&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Business_Ethics_Japan_and_the_Global_Eco.html?hl=&id=NnA2mt6Zf88C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Business_Ethics_Japan_and_the_Global_Eco-sample-epub.acsm?id=NnA2mt6Zf88C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Business_Ethics_Japan_and_the_Global_Eco-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NnA2mt6Zf88C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NnA2mt6Zf88C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "u-1rLZ_WqTwC", "etag": "l0LZBfM2x2E", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/u-1rLZ_WqTwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Introduction to Business Information Systems", "authors": ["Rolf T.

Neither in German-speaking nor English-speaking regions has this complex theme been dealt with in such a comprehensive and thorough manner. Ethics is a matter of doing justice to the human without twisting the facts and ignoring the constraints. The study introduces seven criteria of human justice, that fundamentally relate to the Christian revelation and, at the same time, establish a humanistic and universal approach. Subsequently it focuses on the concrete economic systems and their problems. It describes and analyses various models of market and centrally-planned economies, and evaluates them in the light of middle-level principles, which are informed by both ethical criteria and economic knowledge. Thus the most legitimate economic system is the one which offers the most potential for reforms and self-critique. The merits of this approach are considerable: if the system of the market economy has the advantage of being thoroughly reformable, it also requires regulations which are equitable and responsible. In this view, one better understands the inescapable failure of Marxism but also the ethical ramifications of savage deregulations. Arthur Rich (1910-1992) was Professor of Systematic Theology and Director of the Institute of Social Ethics at the University of Zurich, Switzerland.

The book shows how to take \"Business Concept Maps\" further as information models for new IT paradigms. In a way this books redefines and extends business analysis towards solutions that can be described as business synthesis or business development. Business modellers, analysts and controllers, as well as enterprise information architects, will benefit from the intuitive modelling and designing approach presented in this book. The pragmatic and agile methods presented can be directly applied to improve the way organizations manage their business concepts and their relationships. \"This book is a great contribution to the information management community. It combines a theoretical foundation with practical methods for dealing with important problems. This is rare and very useful.

Besides the rare privilege of having being signed by both Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson (Depres,Friedman, Hart, Samuelson, and Wallace [1950]), among others, this sentence expressed as soon as 1950 the consensus view on the stabilizing effect of fiscal rules governing tax revenue and public expendi tures and transfers. This positive ex ante assessment will have been confirmed ex post as part of the explanation for post war stabilization (Burns [1960], de Long and Summers [1986], Moore and Zarnovitz [1986]). However, it becomes disputed in both its positive and normative aspects. Many institutional changes since the eighties point at curbing back the transfer mechanisms underlying automatic stabilizers, and legal restraints on deficits such as the US balanced budget amendment or the European Maastricht criteria would involve serious risks for the future of stabilizers. Under such rules \"the government would become, almost inevitally, a destabilizer rather than a stabilizer\" said Joseph Stiglitz, quoted by the New York Times (April 1995)). \"Built-in stabilizers are automatic fiscal adjustments that reduce the national income multiplier and thus cushion the effects of changes in autonomous spend ing on the level of income\" (Pechman [1987]). Early analyses of the automatic fiscal stabilizers include the contributions of A. G. Hart [1945], R. Musgrave and M. Miller (1948) and E. C. Brown (1955).", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0792399072"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780792399070"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 341, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cJYTNAu3GxUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cJYTNAu3GxUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cJYTNAu3GxUC&pg=PA268&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cJYTNAu3GxUC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Business_Cycles_and_Macroeconomic_Stabil.html?hl=&id=cJYTNAu3GxUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Business_Cycles_and_Macroeconomic_Stabil-sample-pdf.acsm?id=cJYTNAu3GxUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cJYTNAu3GxUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "fErHRewJzQsC", "etag": "JMiZkBrUgvA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fErHRewJzQsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Essentials of Business Economics", "authors": ["D.N.

Moreover, it demonstrates through an array of convincing examples that a transaction structure and its six elements follow the principles of increasing transaction value, reducing transaction costs, and mitigating transaction risks.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642310232"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642310230"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 150, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.13.10.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&pg=PA7&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpWhw26EeOoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4200.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4200.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&rdid=book-gpWhw26EeOoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4200800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4200800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Approaching_Business_Models_from_an_Econ-sample-epub.acsm?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Approaching_Business_Models_from_an_Econ-sample-pdf.acsm?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gpWhw26EeOoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cZvDnVVmI98C", "etag": "QzBUfg73UJw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cZvDnVVmI98C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Exploring the Grand Challenges for Next Generation E-Business", "subtitle": "8th Workshop on E-Business, WEB 2009, Phoenix, AZ, USA, December 15, 2009, Revised Selected Papers", "authors": ["Raj Sharman", "H.

The lectures held at the First European Business Intelligence Summer School (eBISS), which are presented here in an extended and refined format, cover not only established BI technologies like data warehouses, OLAP query processing, or performance issues, but extend into new aspects that are important in this new environment and for novel applications, e.g., semantic technologies, social network analysis and graphs, services, large-scale management, or collaborative decision making.

This path allows organizations to identify IT Business Value and take advantage of it. The book synthesizes the main approaches that have emerged in recent years, compares these approaches along multiple variables, and finally proposes an advanced and new approach to Information Governance, based on the concept of Organizational Absorptive Capacity. Furthermore, the book presents a new approach to Information Management: the SIGMA (Strategic Information Governance Modelling and Assessment) approach. The new approach is centered on information as a key factor allowing integration between IT applications, organizational capabilities and business strategy. In particular, the Absorptive Capacity concept is presented and discussed: this concept represents the ability of an organization to maintain and absorb the potential of information and IT investments. After having presented and discussed the model, we also provide the reader with a brief presentation of how the SIGMA approach should be applied in companies.

The book establishes a balanced account that equally represents business as problem causers as well as problem solvers, and therefore responds to the urgent need to investigate the intersection between sustainability issues and business participation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319072395"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319072390"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WyxnBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Business_and_Sustainability-sample-epub.acsm?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Business_and_Sustainability-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WyxnBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xmAjwS-Q9LEC", "etag": "XV8lkE4e5W8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xmAjwS-Q9LEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Humanism in Business", "authors": ["Heiko Spitzeck"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2009-02-26", "description": "There are many books about business and society, yet very few of them question the primacy of GDP growth, profit maximization and individual utility maximization.

Experimental Business Research adopts laboratory based experimental economics methods to study an array of business and policy issues spanning the entire business domain including accounting, economics, finance, information systems, marketing and management and policy. \"Experimental economics\" is an established term that refers to the use of controlled laboratory-based procedures to test the implications of economic hypotheses and models and discover replicable patterns of economic behavior. We have coined the term \"Experimental Business Research\" in order to broaden the scope of \"experimental economics\" to encompass experimental finance, experimental accounting, and more generally the use of laboratory-based procedures to test hypotheses and models arising from research in other business related areas, including information systems, marketing and management and policy.

With an ever-greater disparity between the world\u2019s rich and poor, actions have been taken to remove the imperfections and remedy malfunctions of the market mechanism. An underlying theme of these activities is to connect people and make them directly visible to one another; thus the integrating concept of the \u201csolidarity economy\u201d emerges. This volume analyzes diverse examples and practices of solidarity economy. Adam Smith emphasized the importance of \u201csympathy\u201d among people and the role of the \u201cimpartial spectator\u201d in order to control otherwise reckless markets. These major concepts form the basis of a solidarity economy. The examples and practices in this book are based on this framework. The first is the idea of social business, promoted by Prof. M. Yunus of the Grameen Bank. Although the group of five members in the Grameen Bank organization is considered a system of mutual surveillance by some economists, it is not a system based on distrust but a mechanism for mutual help and encouragement. Also examined in this book is organic agriculture, which adheres to the necessity of face-to-face relationships. It pursues environmental concerns and food safety by bringing together consumers and producers in local areas and by sharing knowledge. When consumers and producers are widely separated, a system of certification assures consumers that no chemical pesticides and fertilizers are used. Connecting consumers and producers through certification systems can be seen as part of fair trade mechanisms. These mechanisms are applied in certified coffee programs, for instance, to reduce poverty, to protect the environment, and to safeguard human rights. This book proposes that all these seemingly different types of activities can be understood as part of the solidarity economy. With this unifying theme, the book will be useful for both theoretical investigations and practical applications.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9784431554714"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "4431554718"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 108, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&pg=PR5&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=64&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-IESMBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Solidarity_Economy_and_Social_Business-sample-epub.acsm?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Solidarity_Economy_and_Social_Business-sample-pdf.acsm?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IESMBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "-1upyJBJmpIC", "etag": "CCkes9W+Ytc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/-1upyJBJmpIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "E-Business and Virtual Enterprises", "subtitle": "Managing Business-to-Business Cooperation", "authors": ["Luis M.

The first efforts in virtual enterprises (VE) were strongly constrained by the need to design and develop horizontal infrastructures aimed at supporting the basic collaboration needs of consortia of enterprises. Even pilot projects that were focused on specific business domains were forced to first develop some basic infrastructures before being able to develop their specific business models. Nowadays, although there is still a need to consolidate and standardize the horizontal infrastructures, the focus is more and more directed to the development of new vertical business models and the corresponding support tools. At the same time, in the earlier R&D projects, the attention was almost exclusively devoted to the operation phase of the VE life cycle, while now there are more activities addressing the creation phase, developing mechanisms to support the rapid formation of new virtual organizations for new business opportunities. In order to complete the life cycle, there is a need to also invest on support for VE dissolution.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0792372050"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780792372059"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 532, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-1upyJBJmpIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-1upyJBJmpIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-1upyJBJmpIC&pg=PA413&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-1upyJBJmpIC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/E_Business_and_Virtual_Enterprises.html?hl=&id=-1upyJBJmpIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/E_Business_and_Virtual_Enterprises-sample-pdf.acsm?id=-1upyJBJmpIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-1upyJBJmpIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "jz_5-zKWoPsC", "etag": "LB/Rhrt+4Lg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jz_5-zKWoPsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Business, Economics and Enterprise", "subtitle": "Teaching School Subjects 11-19", "authors": ["Peter Davies", "Jacek Brant"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "Part of a prestigious new series, this book provides stimulating assistance to teachers in their early professional development on defining their subject knowledge and raising questions about business education and economics as school subjects.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415344328"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415344326"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 241, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jz_5-zKWoPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jz_5-zKWoPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jz_5-zKWoPsC&pg=PA86&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jz_5-zKWoPsC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Business_Economics_and_Enterprise.html?hl=&id=jz_5-zKWoPsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jz_5-zKWoPsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LpiE8Y30z-8C", "etag": "AEXRmTWujeI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LpiE8Y30z-8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Psychology of Decision Making in Economics, Business and Finance", "authors": ["Klaus P.

Using different theoretical backgrounds from various areas including behavioral economics, game theory, and complex adaptive systems, the contributors aim to help readers avoid common problems and difficulties that they could face with poor implementation. The book\u2019s contributors are scholars and academics from the many areas where the key theory of gamification typically comes from. Ultimately, the book\u2019s goal is to help bring together the theories from these different disciplines to the field of practice in education and business. The book is divided into four parts: Theory, Education, Business, and Use Cases. Part I provides a foundation on the theory of gamification and offers insight into some of the outstanding questions that have yet to be addressed. In Part II, the application and value that gamification can bring within the education sector is examined. The book then changes focus in Part III to spotlight the use of gamification within business environments. The topics also cover educational aspects like improved learning outcomes, motivation, and learning retention at the workplace. Finally Part IV concentrates on the applications and use of gamification through a series of case studies and key elements that are used in real situations to drive real results.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319102085"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319102087"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 710, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Mathematics"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA385&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13098, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13098, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-m_eSBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13098000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13098000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Gamification_in_Education_and_Business-sample-epub.acsm?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Gamification_in_Education_and_Business-sample-pdf.acsm?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=m_eSBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "BnQN6227P58C", "etag": "X2s3PDP3t2s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BnQN6227P58C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Business Regulation and Public Policy", "subtitle": "The Costs and Benefits of Compliance", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Nijsen", "John Hudson", "Christoph M\u00fcller", "Kees van Paridon", "R.

On the other hand, society is becoming increasingly aware of the environmental, safety, health, financial, and other risks of business activity. Government oversight seems to be one of the answers to safeguard against these risks. But how can we deregulate and regulate without jeopardizing our public goals or acting as a brake on economic growth? Many instruments are available to assess the effects of laws regulating business, including the regulatory impact assessment (RIA), which contains cost/benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, risk analysis, and cost assessments. This book argues that public goals will be achieved more effectively if compliance costs of the enterprises are as low as possible. Highlighting examples from a wide spectrum of industries and countries, the authors propose a new kind of RIA, the business impact assessment (BIA), designed to improve both business and public policy decision making.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780387776781"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0387776788"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 360, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BnQN6227P58C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BnQN6227P58C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BnQN6227P58C&pg=PA40&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BnQN6227P58C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BnQN6227P58C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BnQN6227P58C&rdid=book-BnQN6227P58C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Business_Regulation_and_Public_Policy-sample-epub.acsm?id=BnQN6227P58C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Business_Regulation_and_Public_Policy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=BnQN6227P58C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BnQN6227P58C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "fi6wAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "k1+bxJ8mPtM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fi6wAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Making the Compelling Business Case", "subtitle": "Decision-Making Techniques for Successful Business Growth", "authors": ["W.

We also experience the 'happy days' when our faith in the future becomes almost limitless, and when we forget that the tide will turn again. But do business cycles exist? What creates them? Is it mass psychology, or phenomena in the management of business? Are the banks to blame or should we be looking to the media, the unions, the entrepreneurs or the politicians?\" \"Lars Tvede's story moves back in time to the Scottish gambler and financial genius, John Law, and then on to the distracted Adam Smith, the stockbroker Ricardo, the investment banker Thornton, the extrovert Schumpeter, the speculator Jay Gould and many others. Gradually we reach the computer jugglers of the modern day who, with giant networks of equations, try to solve the same questions that have attracted the attention of classical economists throughout the centuries.\" \"Throughout this volume, business cycle theories are used to explain actual events. We are told how theoretical thinking has reflected the economist's own experiences of hyper-inflations, depressions, speculation orgies, liquidity squeezes and - most recently - the Internet crash. The reader can follow the narrative to discover how economists often thought that problems had been solved until new data changed the economic picture once again.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Since 1990, when the country experienced the bloodiest revolution of all of the Warsaw Pact members, Romania has gone through withering change. While the formal transition from a totalitarian, communist state was completed in 2007 with Romania\u2019s accession into the European Union, the adaptation of the nation\u2019s people and business climate to a market-based economy is a daily occurrence. In the 2000\u2019s, in the lead up to EU accession, Romania was one of the largest recipients of Foreign Direct Investment in the world. While multinational corporations poured in hundreds of billions of dollars, there was also a restructuring of the way business was conducted. Western systems of management and organization\u2014foreign to most Romanian academics and business people\u2014almost overnight transformed the way the marketplace was perceived. Romania\u2019s entrepreneurs were quick to adapt to the new ways, leveraging new opportunities in the environment. Fortunes were made. Multinationals also burgeoned in Romania. Companies like Microsoft, General Electric, Timken, Kraft, P&G, Renault and dozens of others successfully took advantage of the possibilities created by a relatively well-educated population that was moving into the middle class. For the most part, however, researchers and scholars were caught off guard by the quickening pace of business change in Romania. Only until very recently has the academic community at large been able to wade through the murkiness and begin to see what the new landscape looks like. It is the purpose of this edited volume, which includes the work of some of Romania\u2019s finest business scholars, to provide even greater clarity to the current and future scene. Moreover, the experience in Romania helps shed light on the dynamics of economic and business transition throughout Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and other emerging regions, with implications for practice, policymaking, and research.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461468653"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461468655"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 306, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=85&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-KD-9BAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Changing_Business_Landscape_of_Roman-sample-epub.acsm?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Changing_Business_Landscape_of_Roman-sample-pdf.acsm?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KD-9BAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Oc6kHlhPPAMC", "etag": "tN0/MmZfccE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Oc6kHlhPPAMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Educational Innovation in Economics and Business IV", "subtitle": "Learning in a Changing Environment", "authors": ["Jeanette Hommes", "Piet K.

It examines how to ensure that the objectives and structures employed are appropriate in the modern environment. The second section `The Structure of the Learning Environment' is a continuation of the first section but focuses on how the learning environment is designed to facilitate the student's learning.

The purpose of this book is to present an approach to how to reorganize businesses using the discipline of software engineering as a guiding paradigm. The author's thesis is that software engineering provides the necessary analytical expertise for defining business processes and the tools to transform process descriptions to support systems. The author begins by introducing the concepts and needs for business reengineering and principles and practice of software engineering. He then shows how by concentrating on processes, a business can define the information base required and how it is to be constructed. As a result, any manager or technically-minded person will learn how to implement the reengineering of a business.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0387945539"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780387945538"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 275, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nkh-J49L5PIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nkh-J49L5PIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nkh-J49L5PIC&pg=PR5&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nkh-J49L5PIC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Software_Methods_for_Business_Reengineer.html?hl=&id=Nkh-J49L5PIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Software_Methods_for_Business_Reengineer-sample-epub.acsm?id=Nkh-J49L5PIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Software_Methods_for_Business_Reengineer-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Nkh-J49L5PIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Nkh-J49L5PIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "f-IaBgAAQBAJ", "etag": "WTt6wNiJS2U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/f-IaBgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Location of International Business Activities", "subtitle": "Integrating Ideas from Research in International Business, Strategic Management and Economic Geography", "authors": ["Academy of International Business ."], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2014-12-02", "description": "In recent years an extensive range of new research has been revisiting the topic of the location of international business activities, from a variety of different perspectives and background interests. This work has been inspired in part by two apparently quite different but actually related contemporary trends: on the one hand, an emergence or revitalization of clusters of activities co-located in or around selected global city regions or fast growing metropolitan areas; and on the other hand, an increased global dispersion of activities conducted within the value chains managed or coordinated by many large multinational enterprises and their business partners. The former trend has given rise to discussions of how the elite of the cultural-cognitive economy of the 21st century (in Allen Scott's terminology) or the creative class (Richard Florida's term) are now being drawn or brought back to major urban centers; while the latter trend is associated with debates over outsourcing, and the economic and social consequences of shifts in the ownership and location of distinct nodes of value chains once production systems become more fragmented and the component parts of such systems become more geographically dispersed. An increased interest in the subject of international business location has been shown by scholars in Strategic Management, in Economic Geography, and in Regional Science, as well as in our own interdisciplinary field of International Business Studies. However, as is often the case in academic research communities, these bodies of scholarship have tended to develop at something of a distance from one another, each conversing internally more than they have with one another. Location of International Business Activities aims to promote a greater conversation between those interested in the topic of Location from various different backgrounds or starting points. The articles are taken from a special issue on the theme of the Multinational in Geographic Space which was published by The Journal of International Business Studies in 2013.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781137472311"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1137472316"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 283, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT24&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-f-IaBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Location_of_International_Business_Activ-sample-epub.acsm?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Location_of_International_Business_Activ-sample-pdf.acsm?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=f-IaBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "gBD0Y2khY2MC", "etag": "Lh7a/edNlKk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gBD0Y2khY2MC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Economic and Business Consequences of the EMU", "subtitle": "A Challenge for Governments, Financial Institutions, and Firms", "authors": ["Hubert Ooghe", "Freddy Heylen", "Rudy Vander Vennet", "Jan Vermaut"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2000-09-30", "description": "The European Monetary Union (EMU) got under way on 1 January 1999. Since then 11 European countries share a common currency, the Euro, and pursue a common monetary policy managed by the European Central Bank (ECB). After forty years of economic integration, Europe has the wherewithal with which to enter the 21st century. However monetary union has implications for nearly all areas of economic activity and decision-making. Throughout the academic world researchers are fully occupied with the theoretical analysis of the impact of the Euro and the effects of incorporating the new operational framework into their economic models. Businesses and government departments are concerned primarily with the practical implementation of the single currency. For all those who play a part in the economy, it is a question of making the most of the macro and microeconomic opportunities offered by the Euro and minimizing any threats. The Economic and Business Consequences of the EMU describes the economic consequences of the introduction of the EMU and the Euro for governments, financial institutions and firms. The volume,s aims are threefold: To make a first assessment after about a year=s experience with Economic and Monetary Union; To examine the impact of EMU and the introduction of the Euro in various areas of economic policy, involving both government and the corporate sector including the banking industry; To provide an insight into the challenges that the Euro offers for the coming years with respect both to macro-economic policy and the development of the financial markets and with respect to business management.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0792379640"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780792379645"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 438, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gBD0Y2khY2MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gBD0Y2khY2MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gBD0Y2khY2MC&pg=PA125&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gBD0Y2khY2MC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Economic_and_Business_Consequences_o.html?hl=&id=gBD0Y2khY2MC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Economic_and_Business_Consequences_o-sample-epub.acsm?id=gBD0Y2khY2MC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Economic_and_Business_Consequences_o-sample-pdf.acsm?id=gBD0Y2khY2MC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gBD0Y2khY2MC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "3jmL54IV6OUC", "etag": "jnXcwLuDEQQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/3jmL54IV6OUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Better Business Regulation in a Risk Society", "authors": ["Alberto Alemanno", "Frank den Butter", "Andr\u00e9 Nijsen", "Jacopo Torriti"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-09-14", "description": "The premise of this volume is that business regulations are expected to grow in the near future as a consequence of the emergence of a \u201c(world) risk society.\u201d Risks related to terrorism, climate change, and financial crises, for example, will penetrate all conditions of life. Increasingly, the decisions and actions of some bring about risks for many in this era of globalization. Controlling these risks implies managing the world through high-quality regulation, with a particular emphasis on businesses and financial institutions. Central to this approach is the argument that a major, if not the primary, aim of regulation is to internalize externalities, or in a broader context, to repair market failure. Such repair can only be accomplished when the costs are smaller than the welfare gains. Featuring contributions from researchers and policy analysts from the fields of economics, management, law, sociology, political science, and environmental policy, this book focuses on three major topics: \u2022 Social risks and business regulation \u2022 Preconditions for better business regulation \u2022 Theoretical issues related to better business regulation Collectively, the authors demonstrate that the easier it is for regulated businesses to comply at the lowest costs possible\u2014without jeopardizing the related public goals\u2014the greater the degree of compliance. When successful, the net result is a balance of individual and collective net benefits, and by further implication, sustainable business practice and economic growth.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461444053"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461444055"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 328, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3jmL54IV6OUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3jmL54IV6OUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3jmL54IV6OUC&pg=PA1&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3jmL54IV6OUC&dq=subject:Economics+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Better_Business_Regulation_in_a_Risk_Soc.html?hl=&id=3jmL54IV6OUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3jmL54IV6OUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "J2yZ2tafzxoC", "etag": "uEZZ2JmDHGM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/J2yZ2tafzxoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Electronic Business and Education", "subtitle": "Recent Advances in Internet Infrastructures", "authors": ["Wendy Chin", "Frederic Patricelli", "V.

It argues that ecology and ethics provide limits for business within which business is legitimate and productive. By transgressing ecological and ethical limits business activities become destructive and self-defeating. Today's business model is based on and cultivates narrow self-centeredness. Both Deep Ecology and Buddhist Economics point out that emphasizing individuality and promoting the greatest fulfillment of the desires of the individual conjointly lead to destruction. Happiness is linked to wholeness, not to personal wealth. We need to find new ways of doing business, ways that respect the ecological and ethical limits of business activities.
