It offers unprecedented capabilities for information interchange and communication, but the developing world lags far behind the developed world in Internet use. Novel uses of information communications technology and the Internet, such as the One Laptop Per Child program, the Hole-in-the-Wall paradigm, and use of mobile devices offer great opportunities for closing the digital divide and revolutionizing education in the developing world. However, broadening access to the Internet will likely lead to increased problems of internet addiction, cyberbullying, and access to objectionable material. Currently, the relevance that video games have acquired as an expression of popular culture is undeniable. Video games were found to be the second most frequent activity that young people from 9 to 16 years old engage in internet. This book discusses computer games as well as the effect the internet and video games have on children and young adults.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1634632176"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781634632171"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 113, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AJDKoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AJDKoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AJDKoQEACAAJ&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AJDKoQEACAAJ&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Computer_Games_Children_and_the_Internet.html?hl=&id=AJDKoQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AJDKoQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book discusses computer games as well as the effect the internet and video games have on children and young adults."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "iH_FmamDQ8AC", "etag": "3ZAMJmMa4+s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iH_FmamDQ8AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Computer Games", "subtitle": "A Bibliography with Indexes", "authors": ["Blair Carter"], "publisher": "Nova Publishers", "publishedDate": "2002", "description": "Lists the most significant writings on computer games, including works that cover recent advances in gaming and the substantial academic research that goes into devising and improving computer games.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1590335260"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781590335260"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 157, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Computer_Games.html?hl=&id=iH_FmamDQ8AC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computer_Games-sample-epub.acsm?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computer_Games-sample-pdf.acsm?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iH_FmamDQ8AC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Lists the most significant writings on computer games, including works that cover recent advances in gaming and the substantial academic research that goes into devising and improving computer games."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nKs1vJYbHdIC", "etag": "kigIfaXJm8g", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nKs1vJYbHdIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How Computer Games Help Children Learn", "authors": ["David Williamson Shaffer"], "publisher": "Macmillan", "publishedDate": "2008-01-22", "description": "Evaluates a controversial theory about the educational potential of computer games, revealing how specific games can teach children how to develop creative thinking processes akin to those of today's successful professionals.

Up until now, however, computer games have received relatively little attention from philosophy. Seeking to remedy this, the present collection of newly written papers by philosophers and media researchers addresses a range of philosophical questions related to three issues of crucial importance for understanding the phenomenon of computer games: the nature of gameplay and player experience, the moral evaluability of player and avatar actions, and the reality status of the gaming environment. By doing so, the book aims to establish the philosophy of computer games as an important strand of computer games research, and as a separate field of philosophical inquiry. The book is required reading for anyone with an academic or professional interest in computer games, and will also be of value to readers curious about the philosophical issues raised by contemporary digital culture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400742499"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400742495"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 284, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&rdid=book-q_AVJXKbE4wC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Philosophy_of_Computer_Games-sample-epub.acsm?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Philosophy_of_Computer_Games-sample-pdf.acsm?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book fill this lacuna by bringing philosophers and media researchers together in discussions of the basic concepts needed to understand computer games."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HaaTMiz3DdkC", "etag": "sHXDTxMKYa0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HaaTMiz3DdkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Computer Games and the Social Imaginary", "authors": ["Graeme Kirkpatrick"], "publisher": "Polity", "publishedDate": "2013-10-07", "description": "Computer games have fundamentally altered the relation of self and society in the digital age.

Its ubiquity, as well as the sheer volume of hours young people spend gaming, should make it ripe for urgent academic enquiry, yet the subject was a research backwater until the turn of the millennium. Even today, as tens of millions of young people spend their waking hours manipulating avatars and gaming characters on computer screens, the subject is still treated with scepticism in some academic circles. This handbook aims to reflect the relevance and value of studying digital games, now the subject of a growing number of studies, surveys, conferences and publications. As an overview of the current state of research into digital gaming, the 42 papers included in this handbook focus on the social and cultural relevance of gaming. In doing so, they provide an alternative perspective to one-dimensional studies of gaming, whose agendas do not include cultural factors. The contributions, which range from theoretical approaches to empirical studies, cover various topics including analyses of games themselves, the player-game interaction, and the social context of gaming. In addition, the educational aspects of games and gaming are treated in a discrete section. With material on non-commercial gaming trends such as \u2018modding\u2019, and a multinational group of authors from eleven nations, the handbook is a vital publication demonstrating that new media cultures are far more complex and diverse than commonly assumed in a debate dominated by concerns over violent content.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400727779"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400727771"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 712, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&pg=PA2&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&rdid=book-lMTKQd59Y1IC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computer_Games_and_New_Media_Cultures-sample-epub.acsm?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computer_Games_and_New_Media_Cultures-sample-pdf.acsm?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lMTKQd59Y1IC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The status of <b>computer games</b> and game cultures in society is obviously in a state <br>\nof flux \u2013 also in the academic world? ... is based on (digital) <b>computer technology</b> <br>\nand usually displays a game world (or playing field) on a video screen (\u201cvideo\u201d&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LdzsWrjVn3YC", "etag": "OvFHtohmlb4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LdzsWrjVn3YC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Computer Technology for Kids 1", "publisher": "Rex Bookstore, Inc.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9712329151"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789712329159"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LdzsWrjVn3YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LdzsWrjVn3YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LdzsWrjVn3YC&pg=PA1783&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LdzsWrjVn3YC&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Computer_Technology_for_Kids_1.html?hl=&id=LdzsWrjVn3YC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LdzsWrjVn3YC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Computers</b> are used in day-to-day activities to make life much easier.

Despite the emergence of computer games as a dominant cultural industry (and the accompanying emergence of computer games as the subject of scholarly research), we know little or nothing about the ethics of computer games. Considerations of the morality of computer games seldom go beyond intermittent portrayals of them in the mass media as training devices for teenage serial killers. In this first scholarly exploration of the subject, Miguel Sicart addresses broader issues about the ethics of games, the ethics of playing the games, and the ethical responsibilities of game designers. He argues that computer games are ethical objects, that computer game players are ethical agents, and that the ethics of computer games should be seen as a complex network of responsibilities and moral duties. Players should not be considered passive amoral creatures; they reflect, relate, and create with ethical minds. The games they play are ethical systems, with rules that create gameworlds with values at play. Drawing on concepts from philosophy and game studies, Sicart proposes a framework for analyzing the ethics of computer games as both designed objects and player experiences. After presenting his core theoretical arguments and offering a general theory for understanding computer game ethics, Sicart offers case studies examining single-player games (using Bioshock as an example), multiplayer games (illustrated by Defcon), and online gameworlds (illustrated by World of Warcraft) from an ethical perspective. He explores issues raised by unethical content in computer games and its possible effect on players and offers a synthesis of design theory and ethics that could be used as both analytical tool and inspiration in the creation of ethical gameplay.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262261531"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262261537"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&pg=PA16&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2202.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2202.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&rdid=book-bO6LK2wYNXMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2202460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2202460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Ethics_of_Computer_Games-sample-epub.acsm?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Ethics_of_Computer_Games-sample-pdf.acsm?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bO6LK2wYNXMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Band Brothers.28 Game worlds in <b>computer games</b> are simulated environments, <br>\nwith some fictional elements.29 In ... use of Internet communication <b>technologies</b> <br>\nand computational <b>technologies</b> create, determining if those ethical issues are&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "X1rei66Qri8C", "etag": "Q4A4Ms8mQwA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/X1rei66Qri8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Technologies for E-Learning and Digital Entertainment", "subtitle": "Third International Conference, Edutainment 2008, Nanjing, China, June 25-27, 2008, Proceedings", "authors": ["Zhigeng Pan", "Xiaopeng Zhang", "Abdennour El Rhalibi", "Woontack Woo", "Yi Li"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2008-07-07", "description": "This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the Third International Conference on E-learning and Games, Edutainment 2008, held in Nanjing, China, in June 2008.

Adrian David Cheok argues that entertainment as an end-product is useful for interactive play, however it is also a powerful tool for learning and communication and it is also a key driver for the development of information technology. This book explores the future of entertainment technologies used for communication and describes quantum step research. It will inform and inspire readers to create their own radical inventions and innovations that are not incremental, but which break through ideas and non-obvious solutions. One of the main explorations is the examination of how new forms of computer interaction can lead to radical new forms of technology and art for entertainment computing.

How can we influence the outcome? This action-oriented book identifies the key issues, explores the evidence, and suggests some answers. Avoiding both utopianism and despair, the book presents the voices of technology enthusiasts and skeptics, as well as social activists. The book is organized into three parts. Part I examines the issues in their socio-technical, economic, and historical contexts. Part II--the core of the book--proposes five initiatives for using computers and electronic communications to benefit low-income urban communities: - to provide access to the new technologies in ways that enable low-income people to become active producers rather than passive users;- to use the new technologies to improve the dialogue between public agencies and low-income neighborhoods;- to help low-income youth to exploit the entrepreneurial potential of information technologies;- to develop approaches to education that take advantage of the educational capabilities of the computer;- to promote the community computer: applications of computers and communications technology that foster community development. Part III presents a synthesis of the various topics. Its main questions are, What are the prospects and problems of initiatives to enable the poor to benefit from the new technologies? and What federal, state, and municipal policies would enhance the prospects for success?

Contributors to this volume maintain that computer games are not simply toys, but rather circulate as commodities, new media technologies, and items of visual culture that are embedded in complex social practices. Apart from placing games within longer arcs of cultural history and broader critical debates, the contributors to this volume all adopt a pedagogical and theoretical approach to studying games and gameplay, drawing on the interdisciplinary resources of the humanities and social sciences, particularly new media studies. In eight essays, the authors develop rich and nuanced understandings of the aesthetic appeals and pleasurable engagements of digital gameplay. Topics include the role of \u201ccheats\u201d and \u201ceaster eggs\u201d in influencing cheating as an aesthetic phenomenon of gameplay; the relationship between videogames, gambling, and addiction; players\u2019 aesthetic and kinaesthetic interactions with computing technology; and the epistemology and phenomenology of popular strategy-based wargames and their relationship with real-world military applications.

The increasing role of relatively recent developments such as the internet, mobile telephony and computer gaming, which complement the narrative representation of more traditional media, seems to have acted as a catalyst to unfreeze the standard types of story form that had been appearing on screens for over a hundred years. Storytelling has taken on new forms, in the physical format(s) of the narrative material, the place or device where it is experienced, and the way it is accessed by the viewer \u2013 in particular, a viewer who might now also be a creator, modifier, or active participant in the represented audiovisual experience. Including texts by leading media scholars Erkki Huhtamo and Ryszard W. Kluszczynski, this book offers both historical and contemporary analyses of a variety of these \u201cexpanding practices in audiovisual narrative\u201d. Chapters discuss mobile and locative (and hybrid) narrative media; the connection between computer gaming and more traditional forms of storytelling and game-playing; the use of computational algorithms to organise and access narrative content; and explain how the traditional documentary film form is being transformed by the potential of the audience to participate in, or change the form of, a non-fictional narrative. Historically, the work of Luc Courchesne and Rad\u00faz \u010cin\u010dera is analysed, as is the media-archaeological context of interactivity, pushing buttons, and group experiences. Narrative forms will undoubtedly continue their process of expansion and evolution, such that one can never truly represent the \u201cstate of the art\u201d of current practice in audiovisual digital media. Nevertheless, the articles presented here offer useful source material to inform scholars and practitioners from a variety of related fields about certain historical, cultural and theoretical aspects of the evolution of the narrative form in the digital age.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781443869065"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1443869066"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 210, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6380.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6380.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-TDZQBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6380790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6380790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Expanding_Practices_in_Audiovisual_Narra-sample-pdf.acsm?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TDZQBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "2 Here I am using \u201cdigital games\u201d as an umbrella term for both \u201c<b>computer games</b>\u201d <br>\nand \u201c<b>video games</b>. ... particular kinds of <b>technologies</b> while \u201cdigital games\u201d <br>\nindicates that the games in question are implemented in a (<b>computer</b>) <b>technology</b> <br>\nthat&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9njZ482OYfwC", "etag": "/0jfcPXGu4E", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9njZ482OYfwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games", "authors": ["Alberto Menache"], "publisher": "Morgan Kaufmann", "publishedDate": "2000", "description": "Motion capture is a technique for recording a performance and then translating it into mathematical terms.

Press", "publishedDate": "2010-08-13", "description": "An exploration of the way videogames mount arguments and make expressive statements about the world that analyzes their unique persuasive power in terms of their computational properties. Videogames are an expressive medium, and a persuasive medium; they represent how real and imagined systems work, and they invite players to interact with those systems and form judgments about them. In this innovative analysis, Ian Bogost examines the way videogames mount arguments and influence players. Drawing on the 2,500-year history of rhetoric, the study of persuasive expression, Bogost analyzes rhetoric's unique function in software in general and videogames in particular. The field of media studies already analyzes visual rhetoric, the art of using imagery and visual representation persuasively. Bogost argues that videogames, thanks to their basic representational mode of procedurality (rule-based representations and interactions), open a new domain for persuasion; they realize a new form of rhetoric. Bogost calls this new form \"procedural rhetoric,\" a type of rhetoric tied to the core affordances of computers: running processes and executing rule-based symbolic manipulation. He argues further that videogames have a unique persuasive power that goes beyond other forms of computational persuasion. Not only can videogames support existing social and cultural positions, but they can also disrupt and change these positions themselves, leading to potentially significant long-term social change. Bogost looks at three areas in which videogame persuasion has already taken form and shows considerable potential: politics, advertising, and learning.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262261944"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262261944"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Games & Activities"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&pg=PA59&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GC7MD17YvJEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2202.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2202.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&rdid=book-GC7MD17YvJEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2202460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2202460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Persuasive_Games-sample-epub.acsm?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Persuasive_Games-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GC7MD17YvJEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The most important distinction mirrors the difference between persuasive games <br>\nand serious games.

Especially in the health education domain, there are now many reports of the use of video games intended to produce changes in players' knowledge, attitudes or behaviours that will transfer to 'real life' settings outside the context of the game. The authors of this book analyse the learning models implicit in health games described in the literature, and relates these to established learning models in order to illustrate the nature of the gaps between current game designs and relevant learning theory and technology. This analysis provides a systematic framework for identifying principles of game design that are soundly based both in theory and research evidence. Examples are provided from recent game designs. This book also reports on whether computer games can be put to good use for mathematics educational purposes for young teenagers. The authors believe that computer games can be used as a complement for making routine practice more varied, more enjoyable and more effective. In addition, digital epistemic games are computer-based games that mediate mental, intellectual, knowledge-oriented activities.

Now we see in the past quarter-century how the philosophy of science has been profoundly in fluenced by historical studies of the sciences, and no longer concerned so single-mindedly with the analysis of theory and explanation, with the re lation between hypotheses and experimental observation. Now also we see the traditional historical studies of technology supplemented by phi losophical questions, and no longer so plainly focussed upon contexts of application, on invention and practical engineering, and on the mutually stimulating relations between technology and society. Further, alas, the neat division of intellectual labor, those clearly drawn distinctions be tween science and technology, between the theoretical and the applied, between discovery and justification, between internalist and externalist approaches . . . all, all have become muddled! Partly, this is due to internal revolutions within the philosophy and his tory of science (the first result being recognition of their mutual rele vance). Partly, however, this state of 'muddle' is due to external factors: science, at the least in the last half-century, has become so intimately connected with technology, and technological developments have cre ated so many new fields of scientific (and philosophical) inquiry that any critical reflection on scientific and technological endeavors must hence forth take their interaction into account.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400945128"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400945124"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA336&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=armLBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5463.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5463.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-armLBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5463400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5463400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Philosophy_and_Technology_II-sample-epub.acsm?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Philosophy_and_Technology_II-sample-pdf.acsm?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A phenomenological biography of an encounter with <b>computers</b> by a descriptive <br>\nsociologist.

In doing so, the book establishes a more solid foundation for making better and more complex analyses of experience creation, paving the way for the development of analytically based and innovative experiences in experience firms and institutions.

Murphy"], "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "publishedDate": "2011-03-17", "description": "Now if I just remembered where I put that original TV play device--the universal remote control . . . Television is a global industry, a medium of representation, an architectural component of space, and a nearly universal frame of reference for viewers. Yet it is also an abstraction and an often misunderstood science whose critical influence on the development, history, and diffusion of new media has been both minimized and overlooked. How Television Invented New Media adjusts the picture of television culturally while providing a corrective history of new media studies itself. Personal computers, video game systems, even iPods and the Internet built upon and borrowed from television to become viable forms. The earliest personal computers, disguised as video games using TV sets as monitors, provided a case study for television's key role in the emergence of digital interactive devices. Sheila C. Murphy analyzes how specific technologies emerge and how representations, from South Park to Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog, mine the history of television just as they converge with new methods of the making and circulation of images. Past and failed attempts to link television to computers and the Web also indicate how services like Hulu or Netflix On-Demand can give rise to a new era for entertainment and program viewing online. In these concrete ways, television's role in new and emerging media is solidified and finally recognized.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813550947"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0813550947"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1mHsq2_s8qEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1mHsq2_s8qEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1mHsq2_s8qEC&pg=PA50&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1mHsq2_s8qEC&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_Television_Invented_New_Media.html?hl=&id=1mHsq2_s8qEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_Television_Invented_New_Media-sample-pdf.acsm?id=1mHsq2_s8qEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1mHsq2_s8qEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>computing</b> and mass media contain important contributions from amateurs and <br>\nhobbyists, the widespread public ...

Remedies ranging from family dynamics to teacher-student interactions to the controversial question of the gender organization of schools and school systems are proposed. Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide: *considers the authors' original research as well as recently published work by other leading scholars; *documents that girls are at a marked disadvantage in their ability to learn about and profit from information technology in our educational system; *sets the problem of computer anxiety in a rich context of social psychological theories, including stereotype threat, self-fulfilling prophecy, social comparison and attribution theory; and *offers suggestions that parents, teachers, and school systems can implement to overcome the digital divide. The book is intended to appeal to students and researchers in the social and behavioral sciences, education, human factors, and computer science interested in gender differences in general, and in human-computer interaction, in particular.

The author analyzes narrative via an original categorization of story forms in games. He also discusses video games as works of science fiction, including their characteristic themes and the links between them and other forms of science fiction. Delve into a Collection of Science Fiction Games The beginning chapters explore game design and the history of science-fictional video games.

They had also - signed a binary image array processor and programming language, complete with a user\u2019s guide, to facilitate designing software for this one-of-a-kindprocessor. The overall system enabled programmable real-time image processing at video rate for many operations. I had the whole lab to myself. I designed software that detected an object in the eldofview,trackeditsmovementsinrealtime,anddisplayedarunningdescription of the events in English. For example: \u201cAn object has appeared in the upper right corner...Itismovingdownandtotheleft...Nowtheobjectisgettingcloser...The object moved out of sight to the left\u201d\u2014about like that.

COVERAGE Part I offers an overview of the field and conceptualizations of media effects, along with a range of quantitative and qualitative methodologies used in the study of media effects. Part II focuses on prominent theoretical approaches to the study of media effects from a more societal perspective, tracing their historical contexts, theoretical developments, criticisms and controversies, and the impact of the new media environment on current and future research. Part III emphasizes the various factors that influence the critical functions of message selection and processing central to a host of mass media application contexts. Part IV reflects a dominant trend in the media effects literature\u2014that of persuasion and learning\u2014and traces related theoretical perspectives through the various contexts in which media may have such effects. Part V explores the contexts and audiences that have been traditional foci of media effects research, such as children, violence, body image, and race, addressing the theories most applicable to those contexts. Part VI highlights a concern central and unique to the communication discipline\u2014message medium\u2014and how it influences effects ranging from what messages are attended to, how we spend our time, and even how we think.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781483374888"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1483374882"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 656, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=scvuAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=scvuAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=scvuAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA610&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=scvuAwAAQBAJ&dq=Video+Games+computers+technology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_SAGE_Handbook_of_Media_Processes_and.html?hl=&id=scvuAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_SAGE_Handbook_of_Media_Processes_and-sample-pdf.acsm?id=scvuAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=scvuAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... <b>Technology</b> Communicatory utility, 255\u2013256 Compensatory principal, 121\u2013122 <br>\n<b>Computer games</b>, 16 See also Digital games; Games; <b>Video games Computer</b>-<br>\nmediated communication (CMC), 148 adaptive/<b>technology</b> structuration and, 498<br>\n&nbsp;..."}}]
