The author views his travels through his childhood binoculars, backward, of course, as he writes about the wondrous, magical, and bizarre experiences that can only happen with a backpack, a good pair of walking shoes, and a sense of curiosity.

They have traveled back every year and lovingly chronicled each experience in detailed letters to Kalpana's sisters in India. The letters follow the daily routine in remote bush camps, covering the details of camp life along with the excitement and thrill of walking safaris, canoe trips, and game drives. One can almost hear the hippos by night and smell the fresh lavender along the path, as Tuthill describes the nightly \"sundowners\" enjoyed with her beloved husband, and details the spectacular views and experiences they shared together.

But unlike his illustrious successors, this quiet tenant farmer's son from the Scottish Borders travelled alone; relieved of his meager possessions, he was soon wholly dependant on local hospitality. In what he called \"a plain unvarnished tale\" he related horrific ordeals with admirable detachment - never more tested than on his return journey through Bamako, now the capital of Mali. The Road to Kano - Hugh Clapperton In one of exploration's unhappier sagas two Scots, Captain Hugh Clapperton and Dr. Walter Oudney, were saddled with the unspeakable Major Dixon Denham on a three year journey to Lake Chad and beyond. Clapperton mapped much of northern Nigeria and emerged with credit. Major Denham also excelled himself, twice absconding, then accusing Oudney of incompetence and Clapperton of buggery. Happily the Major was absent in 1824, after nursing his dying friend, Clapperton became the first European to reach Kano. Down the Niger - Richard Lander As Clapperton's manservant, Lander attended his dying master on his 1825 expedition to the Niger and was then commissioned, with his brother John, to continue the exploration of the river. The mystery of its lower course was finally solved when in 1831 they sailed down through Nigeria to the delta and the sea. Unassuming Cornishmen, the Landers approached their task with a refreshing confidence in goodwill of Africans. It paid of in a knife-edge encounter at the confluence of the Benoue, although Richard subsequently paid the price with his life. Arrival in Timbuktu - Heinrich Barth Born in Hamburg, Barth was already an experienced traveler and a methodical scholar when in 1850 he joined a British expedition to investigate Africa's internal slave trade. From Tripoli the expedition crossed the Sahara to Lake Chad. Its leader died but Barth continued on alone, exploring vast tract of the Sahel from northern Cameroon to Mali. Timbuktu, previously visited only by A.G. Laing and Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9, provided the climax as Barth, in disguise, approached the forbidden city by boat from the Niger. My Ogow\u00e9 Fans - Mary Kingsley Self-educated while she nursed her elderly parents, Mary Kingsley had known only middle-class English domesticity until venturing to West Africa in 1892. Her parents had died and, unmarried, she determined to study \"fish and fetish\" for the British Museum. Her 1894 ascent of Gabon's Ogow\u00e9 River (from Travels in West Africa, 1897) established her a genuine pioneer and an inimitable narrator. She died six years later while nursing prisoners during the Boer War.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472100054"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472100050"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 160, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Travel"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT4&dq=Africa+Travel&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 125.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 125.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DOWdBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 125080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 125080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Mammoth_Book_of_Travel_in_Dangerous-sample-epub.acsm?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DOWdBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Park&#39;s 1795\u20137 odyssey in search of the Niger first awakened the world to the <br>\nfeasibility ofa white man penetrating subSaharan <b>Africa</b>.But unlike his illustrious <br>\nsuccessors, this quiet tenant farmer&#39;s sonfromthe Scottish Borders travelledalone;<br>\n&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "wuSdBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "y0yHoEwKRMs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wuSdBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Mammoth Book of Travel in Dangerous Places: East and Central Africa", "authors": ["John Keay"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2012-06-07", "description": "Among the Sudanese - James Bruce Bruce reached the source of the Blue Nile in 1771, a century before the search for the source of the White Nile became headline news. His descriptions of the cruelties and orgies at Gondar, the Ethiopian capital, were greeted with disbelief; so was his account of the Sudanese rulers, and their queens, at Sennar. He was later shown to be an accurate observer as well as the eighteenth century's most intrepid traveller. Not the Source of the Nile - Richard Francis Burton In Burton a brilliant mind and dauntless physique were matched with a restless spirit and a deeply troubled soul to produce the most complex of characters. Contemptuous of other mortals, including Speke, his companion and rival, he found solace only in the extremities of erudition and adventure. A Glimpse of Lake Victoria - John Hanning Speke In July 1858, while returning from Lake Tanganyika with Burton, Speke made a solo excursion to the north in search of an even larger lake reported by an Arab informant. Although partially blind and unable to ascertain its extent, he named this lake \"Victoria\" and boldly declared it the long sought source of the White Nile. The Reservoir of the Nile - Samuel White Baker Amongst professional explorers and big game hunters, none was as successful as Baker. A bluff and plausible figure, wealthy and resourceful, he conducted his explorations on the grand scale, invariably reached his goal and invariably reaped the rewards. Last Days - David Livingstone Livingstone was nurtured in poverty and religious fervour. He reached southern Africa as a missionary doctor but, more suited to solitary exploration, edged north in a series of pioneering journeys into the interior. Encounters on the Upper Congo - Henry Morton Stanley Stanley made his name as an explorer by tracking down Livingstone in 1871. But obscure Welsh origins, plus the adoption of US citizenship and professional journalism, did not endear him to London's geographical establishment. His response was to out-travel all contemporaries, beginning with the first ever coast-to-coast crossing of equatorial Africa. A Novice at Large - Joseph Thomson Barely twenty and just out of Edinburgh University, Thompson was unexpectedly employed on the Royal Geographical Society's 1878 expedition to the Central African lakes. Unlike Burton he admired Africans; unlike Stanley he would not fight them. His motto - \"he who goes slowly, goes safely; he who goes safely, goes far\" - was never more seriously tested that when, just six weeks inland from Dar es Salaam, his first expedition lost Keith Johnston, its leader and Thompson's only European companion.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472100061"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472100069"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 160, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Travel"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT36&dq=Africa+Travel&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 199.42, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 139.59, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-wuSdBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 199420000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 139590000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Mammoth_Book_of_Travel_in_Dangerous-sample-epub.acsm?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wuSdBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "He reached southern <b>Africa</b> asa missionary doctor but, more suited to solitary <br>\nexploration, edgednorth ina series ofpioneering journeys into the interior.

It brings together analyses of a unique mix of data sources and evaluations of public policies and development projects to recommend ways to increase agricultural productivity in Africa. This book is timely in light of the recent and ongoing growth recovery across the continent. The good news is that agricultural productivity in Africa increased at a moderate rate between 1961 and 2012, although there are variations in the rate of growth in land, labor, and total factor productivities depending on country and region. Differences in input use and capital intensities in agricultural production in the various farming systems and agricultural productivity zones also affect advancements in technology. One conclusion based on the book\u2019s research findings derives from the substantial spatial variation in agricultural productivity. For areas with similar agricultural productivity growth trends and factors, what works well in one area can be used as the basis for formulating best-fit, location-specific agricultural policies, investments, and interventions in similar areas. This finding along with others will be of particular interest to policy- and decisionmakers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780896298811"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0896298817"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 386, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ESvDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ESvDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1ESvDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA142&dq=Africa+Travel&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ESvDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ESvDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 0, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 0, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ESvDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1ESvDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api"}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "ALL_PAGES", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1ESvDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "East Africa has the best market access, with 9.3 hours of average travel time, <br>\nwhile West Africa has the worst\u2014almost double East <b>Africa&#39;s travel</b> time.

Press of Mississippi", "publishedDate": "2001", "description": "Attracted to remote lands by his interest in the postcolonial struggle, Richard Wright (1908-1960) became one of the few African Americans of his time to engage in travel writing. He went to emerging nations not as a sightseer but as a student of their cultures, learning the politics and the processes of social transformation. When Wright fled from the United States in 1946 to live as an expatriate in Paris, he was exposed to intellectual thoughts and challenges that transcended his social and political education in America. Three events broadened his world view- his introduction to French existentialism, the rise of the Pan-Africanist movement to decolonize Africa, and Indonesia's declaration of independence from colonial rule in 1945. During the 1950s as he traveled to emerging nations his encounters produced four travel narratives-Black Power (1953), The Color Curtain (1956), Pagan Spain (1956), and White Man, Listen! (1957). Upon his death in 1960, he left behind an unfinished book on French West Africa, which exists only in notes, outlines, and a draft. Written by multinational scholars, this collection of essays exploring Wright's travel writings shows how in his hands the genre of travel writing resisted, adapted, or modified the forms and formats practiced by white authors. Enhanced by nine photographs taken by Wright during his travels, the essays focus on each of Wright's four separate narratives as well as upon his unfinished book and reveal how Wright drew on such non-Western influences as the African American slave narrative and Asian literature of protest and resistance. The essays critique Wright's representation of customs and people and employ a broad range of interpretive modes, including the theories of formalism, feminism, and postmodernism, among others. Wright's travel books are proved here to be innovative narratives that laid down the roots of such later genres as postcolonial literature, contemporary travel writing, and resistance literature. Virginia Whatley Smith is an associate professor of English at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Her work has appeared in African American Review, Mississippi Quarterly, and MLA Approaches to Teaching Wright's 'Native Son.'", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1578063477"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781578063475"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 237, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J7LdADbgvgsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J7LdADbgvgsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J7LdADbgvgsC&pg=PA20&dq=Africa+Travel&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J7LdADbgvgsC&dq=Africa+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Richard_Wright_s_Travel_Writings.html?hl=&id=J7LdADbgvgsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=J7LdADbgvgsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Wright eventually wrote on <b>Africa</b>, but his travelogue entitled Black Power (1954) <br>\nis one of his most criticized books, especially by <b>Africans</b> who feel betrayed and <br>\nmisrepresented.

We shall begin our journey in Cape Town, South Africa in the fall of 1964. During the following ten months we will travel and camp along Africas Great North Road. A variety of recently created nations and peoples, a few still struggling to be free, will be visited, among them, South Africa, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and the Congo. There are, at present, more than 700 separate tribes living south of the Great Sahara Desert. Obviously all of them cannot be included. However, we will visit and camp-out with the typical African where he lives, whether it be an Afrikaner living in one of the exclusive multi-level homes cut into the rock cliffs overlooking the Bay of Cape Town surrounded by twelve-foot walls capped with broken glass and razor wire or a Wanderobo tribesman dressed in a loincloth and carrying a bow and sheath of poisoned arrows met along a primitive dusty track running through the Bush country of Tanzania. Our self-contained VW camper gave us the freedom to camp along the streets of any city or village or along the track where Native Africans were living much as they have for many hundreds of years. Please be prepared, watching people and so-called wild animals can take many hours and, in some instances, the supply of daylight runs out. Frequently camp was made along the track out in the Bush and was visited by elephants during the night or a pride of lions stopping by to sharpen their claws on our tires. In one instance several elephants stripped branches off a tree under which we were camped not one of them touched the camper!", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1475926987"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781475926989"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 572, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Travel"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wpZDDq00p18C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wpZDDq00p18C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wpZDDq00p18C&pg=PR13&dq=Africa+Travel&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wpZDDq00p18C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wpZDDq00p18C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 323.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 226.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wpZDDq00p18C&rdid=book-wpZDDq00p18C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 323320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 226320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Africa_s_Great_North_Road_in_a_Vw_Camper-sample-pdf.acsm?id=wpZDDq00p18C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wpZDDq00p18C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "From Brooklyn, New York travel was by freighter to Cape Town, South <b>Africa</b>. <br>\n<b>Travel</b> overland from Cape Town was by a 1960, 40HP VW Camper renamed by <br>\nEmma, \u201cThe Turtle\u201d.

For his details he relied exclusively on his memory, cultivated by the system of a theological education.

After a preliminary visit to the Canary Islands, Kingsley decided to travel to the west coast of Africa. The only non-African women who regularly embarked on (often dangerous) journeys to Africa were usually the wives of missionaries, government officials, or explorers. Exploration and adventure were not seen as fitting roles for women in the Victorian era. Yet, when Mary Kingsley's invalid parents died within six weeks of each other, she followed in her explorer father's footsteps and traveled to Africa against her society's every convention. Here is her lively and witty account of that journey, an immediate bestseller when it first came out in 1897 and every bit as gripping today. Kingsley's complicated and indomitable character shines through in each sentence, as she describes hacking, marching, and climbing her way through the continent.

The discovery is unprecedented, and heralded as the greatest fossil discovery ever made on the African continent and that from a site already famous for being the birthplace of humankind. Discover the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site with 47 stunning pictures, some of them of the infamous Sterkfontein and Wonder Caves, as well as the Origins Centre in Johannesburg and the Maropeng Centre at the Cradle.

It is a story of blood, sweat, toil and tears. It is a story of triumph and occasional disaster. Of nights out under the stars, of searing heat and rain, of endless miles of Africa and of pressing on and never surrendering whatever the odds. Mostly however it is the story of one mans courage and determination to escape the mundane and see the continent he loves and feels so much a part of. It is the story of the human warmth he encounters, and occasionally human wrath and hostility as he crosses troubled countries and borders. Riaan Manser was born in 1973 in Pretoria. He grew up in Zululand and attended John Ross College in Richards Bay. After studying Human Resource Management he took a job in the medical industry. He has been a lifesaver, a surfer and a rugby player. When he took his bicycle to ride around Africa it was as a commitment to do something entirely extraordinary with his life.

The photos that were taken at the time were then found, so the idea of putting them together in print came to mind. The diary has three main elements: 1. Three and a half months with a group of other travellers in two Landrovers starting from London and finishing in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).2. A search for work in Rhodesia but ending up in Cape Town. This includes experiences of trying to find work in these two countries and day to day life. 3. Further travels in Southern Africa in organised trips, using public transport and by hitchhiking on my own. The places visited included well known locations such as Victoria Falls, African game parks, Table Mountain etc, and also some less known places such as the spot where Livingstone's heart was buried and Cecil Rhodes' grave. A trip down a gold mind is also documented. Challenges thrown up include many punctures and breakdowns, the heat of the Sahara and rough roads in the rain forest. There are many anecdotes about the things that happened and the people encountered.

Famous for being in the wrong places at just the right times, Ryszard Kapuscinski arrived in Africa in 1957, at the beginning of the end of colonial rule - the \"sometimes dramatic and painful, sometimes enjoyable and jubilant\" rebirth of a continent. The Shadow of the Sun sums up the author's experiences (\"the record of a 40-year marriage\") in this place that became the central obsession of his remarkable career. From the hopeful years of independence through the bloody disintegration of places like Nigeria, Rwanda and Angola, Kapuscinski recounts great social and political changes through the prism of the ordinary African. He examines the rough-and-ready physical world and identifies the true geography of Africa: a little-understood spiritual universe, an African way of being. He looks also at Africa in the wake of two epoch-making changes: the arrival of AIDS and the definitive departure of the white man. Kapuscinski's rare humanity invests his subjects with a grandeur and a dignity unmatched by any other writer on the Third World, and his unique ability to discern the universal in the particular has never been more powerfully displayed than in this work.

With their wars officially over, Tim Butcher sets out on a journey across both countries, trekking for 350 miles through remote rainforest and malarial swamps. Just as he followed H M Stanley through the Congo - a journey described in his bestseller Blood River - this time he pursues a trail blazed by Graham Greene in 1935 and immortalised in the travel classic Journey Without Maps. Greene took 26 bearers, a case of scotch, and hammocks in which he and his cousin Barbara were carried. Tim walks every blistering inch to gain an extraordinary ground-level view of a troubled and overlooked region. As a journalist in Africa, Tim came to know both countries well although the wars made trips to the jungle hinterland far too risky. This is where he now heads, exploring how rebel groups thrived in the bush for so long and whether the devil of war has truly been chased away. He encounters other 'devils', masked figures guarding the spiritual secrets of jungle communities. Some are no more threatening than schoolmasters but others are much more sinister, relying on ritual cannibalism as a source of their magical power. Tim encounters these devils on an epic journey that demands courage, doggedness and good fortune. Chasing the Devil is a dramatic travel book touching on one of the most fraught parts of the globe at a unique moment in its history. Weaving history and anthropology with personal narrative - as well as new discoveries about Greene - it is as exciting as it is enlightening.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781407087047"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1407087045"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Travel"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.16.7.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JyOSugSth-gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JyOSugSth-gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JyOSugSth-gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Africa+Travel&hl=&cd=112&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JyOSugSth-gC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JyOSugSth-gC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 500.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 250.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JyOSugSth-gC&rdid=book-JyOSugSth-gC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 500320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 250160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chasing_the_Devil-sample-epub.acsm?id=JyOSugSth-gC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JyOSugSth-gC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is where he now heads, exploring how rebel groups thrived in the bush for so long and whether the devil of war has truly been chased away."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WnBdDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "esPQShLozbs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WnBdDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lonely Planet Tanzania", "authors": ["Lonely Planet", "Mary Fitzpatrick", "Ray Bartlett", "David Else", "Anthony Ham", "Helena Smith"], "publisher": "Lonely Planet", "publishedDate": "2018-06-01", "description": "Lonely Planet: The world\u2019s number one travel guide publisher* Lonely Planet Tanzania is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Godwin's parents are liberal whites, his mother a governement-employed doctor, his father an engineer. Through his innocent, young eyes, the story of the beginning of the end of white rule in Africa unfolds. The memoir follows Godwin's personal journey from the eve of war in Rhodesia to his experience fighting in the civil war that he detests to his adventures as a journalist in the new state of Zimbabwe, covering the bloody return to Black rule. With each transition Godwin's voice develops, from that of a boy to a young man to an adult returning to his homeland. This tale of the savage struggle between blacks and whites as the British Colonial period comes to an end is set against the vividly painted background of the myserious world of South Africa.",
