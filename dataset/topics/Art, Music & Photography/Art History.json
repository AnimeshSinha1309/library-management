Evidence for the role of homosexuality in artistic creation has often not survived, in part because the direct expression of homosexuality has often been condemned in Western societies. Gay and Lesbian Studies in Art History presents examples of contemporary art historical research on homoeroticism and homosexuality in the visual arts (chiefly painting and sculpture) of the Western tradition from the ancient to the modern periods. Chapters explore the dynamic interrelation of sexuality and visual art and emphasize problems of historical evidence and interpretation and the need to reconstruct social and cultural realities sometimes quite different from our own. Gay and Lesbian Studies in Art History addresses contemporary art historians\u2019interest in studying sexuality in the visual arts, examining such questions as: What are some of the present-day reasons for, and problems of, this research? How is it related to other research areas within art history and to wider public debates about the meaning, value, and propriety of works of art? While the book examines a variety of research problems and theoretical perspectives, most chapters focus on the historical interpretation of a particular work of art, artist, or visual convention. Chapters present new documentation of the importance of homosexuality in the production and reception of artworks in the Western tradition, develop models for approaching the question of how sexuality and visual creation are related, and explore researchers\u2019experiences and obligations in working in the area of gay and lesbian studies in art history today. Contributing authors stress problems of historical evidence and reconstruction; the social and cultural construction of homosexuality; and the active role of visual conventions in shaping perceptions of homosexuals, homosexuality, and homosexual desire. They discuss both the biography of artists and the significance of individual works of art and the social reception and circulation of works of art in the context of wider religious, legal, medical, political, and economic relations. The book may revise readers\u2019beliefs about the significance and value of a number of works of art hitherto forgotten, neglected, under-appreciated, or misinterpreted.

A monumental achievement and encyclopaedic in scope, it was a comprehensive catalogue of fashion terms from the mid-medieval period up to 1900. It was reissued and updated several times, for the last time in 1976. For decades it has served as a bible for costume historians. The Dictionary of Fashion History completely updates and supplements the Cunningtons' landmark work to bring it up to the present day. Featuring additional terms and revised definitions, this new edition represents an essential reference for costume historians, students of fashion history, or anyone involved in creating period costume for the theatre, film or television.

Today, it continues to adapt and grow as new technologies and viewing platforms become available, and remains an integral cultural and aesthetic entertainment experience for people the world over. Cinema developed against the backdrop of the two world wars, and over the years has seen smaller wars, revolutions, and profound social changes. Its history reflects this changing landscape, and, more than any other art form, developments in technology. In this Very Short Introduction, Nowell-Smith looks at the defining moments of the industry, from silent to sound, black and white to color, and considers its genres from intellectual art house to mass market entertainment.

He moves effortlessly between contemporary issues\u2014the rise of global and minority art and its consequences for Western art history, installation and video art, and the troubled institution of the art museum\u2014and questions central to art history's definition of itself, such as the distinction between high and low culture, art criticism versus art history, and the invention of modernism in art history.

Grouped into three sections, articles examine the sites where art history is taught and studied, the role of institutions in conferring legitimacy, the relationship between modernism and art history, and the systems that define and control it. From museums and universities to law courts and photography studios, the contributors explore a range of different institutions, revealing the complexity of their interaction and their impact on the discipline of art history.\" --BOOK JACKET.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415228689"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415228688"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 329, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FWj0HnQ-f_oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FWj0HnQ-f_oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FWj0HnQ-f_oC&pg=PA260&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FWj0HnQ-f_oC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Art_History_and_Its_Institutions.html?hl=&id=FWj0HnQ-f_oC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FWj0HnQ-f_oC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "JUcX4-WFxOYC", "etag": "3Oih9zoWHc8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JUcX4-WFxOYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Illustrated History of Natural Disasters", "authors": ["Jan Koz\u00e1k", "Vladimir Cerm\u00e1k"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2010-03-14", "description": "This book tells the story of the Earth itself, explaining the interplay of its gradual geologi- levolution, presented as a generally slow and safe process, with the sudden manifestations of natural hazards, which involve disasters that affect the environment and lead to huge material damage and human losses.

However, he has had not only to furnish himself with food, water, building materials, and energy to protect himself against occasional natural adversities. Protecting himself from them meant comprehending their causes, and the essential core of his understanding was in recording and depicting them.

Since its initiation in 1985, CHArt (Computers and the History of Art) has set out to promote interaction between the rapidly developing new Information Technology and the study and practice of Art. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that this interaction has led, not just to the provision of new tools for the carrying out of existing practices, but to the evolution of unprecedented activities and modes of thought. This collection of papers represents the variety, innovation and richness of significant presentations made at the CHArt Conferences of 2001 and 2002. Some show new methods of teaching being employed, making clear in particular the huge advantages that IT can provide for engaging students in learning and interactive discussion. It also shows how much is to be gained from the flexibility of the digital image \u201a\u00c4\u00ec or could be gained if the road block of copyright is finally overcome. Others look at the impact on collections and archives, showing exciting ways of using computers to make available information about collections and archives and to provide new accessibility to archives. The way such material can now be accessed via the internet has revolutionized the search methods of scholars, but it has also made information available to all. However the internet is not only about access. Some papers here show how it also offers the opportunity of exploring the structure of images and dealing with the fascinating possibilities offered by digitisation for visual analysis, searching and reconstruction. Another challenging aspect covered here are the possibilities offered by digital media for new art forms. One point that emerges is that digital art is not some discreet practice, separated from other art forms. It is rather an approach that can involve all manner of association with both other art practices and with other forms of presentation and enquiry, demonstrating that we are witnessing a revolution that affects all our activities and not one that simply leads to the establishment of a new discipline to set alongside others.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781841501161"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1841501166"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 123, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&pg=PT13&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 973.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 486.75, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&rdid=book-VdX6MYM0bHEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 973500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 486750000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Digital_Art_History-sample-epub.acsm?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Digital_Art_History-sample-pdf.acsm?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VdX6MYM0bHEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "owgcDRTKLxUC", "etag": "egq3kfNcSNQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/owgcDRTKLxUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Giving Preservation a History", "subtitle": "Histories of Historic Preservation in the United States", "authors": ["Max Page", "Randall Mason"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "\"Historic preservation has been one of the broadest and longest-lasting land-use reform efforts in this country.

In pursuing his argument, the author explores such diverse materials and themes as: the testimonies of Holocaust survivors; the works of such artists and writers as Charlotte Salomon, Christian Boltanski, and Armando; and the question of what it means to live in a house built by a jew who was later transported to the death camps. He shows that reenactment, as an artistic project, also functions as a critical strategy, one that, unlike historical methods requiring a mediator, speaks directly to us and lures us into the Holocaust. We are then placed in the position of experiencing and being the subjects of that history. We are there, and history is present--but not quite. A confrontation with Nazism or with the Holocaust by means of a re-enactment takes place within the representational realm of art. Our access to this past is no longer mediated by the account of a witness, by a narrator, by the eye of a photographer. We do not respond to a re-presentation of the historical event, but to a presentation or performance of it, and our response is direct or firsthand in a different way.

It discusses the challenge of using verbal and written language to analyse a visual form. Dana Arnold also examines the many different ways of writing about art, and the changing boundaries of the subject of art history. Topics covered include the canon of Art History, the role of the gallery, 'blockbuster' exhibitions, the emergence of social histories of art (Feminist Art History or Queer Art History, for example), the impact of photography, and the development of Art History using artefacts such as the altarpiece, the portrait, or pornography, to explore social and cultural issues such as consumption, taste, religion, and politics. Importantly, this book explains how the traditional emphasis on periods and styles originates in western art production and can obscure other critical approaches, as well as art from non western cultures.

Global Design History moves us past this limited view of globalism, broadening our sense of this key term in history and theory. Individual chapters focus our attention on objects, and the stories they can tell us about cultural interactions on a global scale. They place these concrete things into contexts, such as trade, empire, mediation, and various forms of design practice. Among the varied topics included are: the global underpinnings of Renaissance material culture the trade of Indian cottons in the eighteenth-century the Japanese tea ceremony as a case of \u2018import substitution\u2019 German design in the context of empire handcrafted modernist furniture in Turkey Australian fashions employing \u2018ethnic\u2019 motifs an experimental UK-Ghanaian design partnership Chinese social networking websites the international circulation of contemporary architects. Featuring work from leading design historians, each chapter is paired with a \u2018response\u2019, designed to expand the discussion and test the methodologies on offer. An extensive bibliography and resource guide will also aid further research, providing students with a user friendly model for approaches to global design. Global Design History will be useful for upper-level undergraduate and postgraduate students, academics and researchers in design history and art history, and related subjects such as anthropology, craft studies and cultural geography.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781136833083"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1136833080"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6mdoB_yYfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6mdoB_yYfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=S6mdoB_yYfkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=S6mdoB_yYfkC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Design_History.html?hl=&id=S6mdoB_yYfkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Global_Design_History-sample-epub.acsm?id=S6mdoB_yYfkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=S6mdoB_yYfkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "MDy8zIN9mRcC", "etag": "lVJSjuI4+wM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MDy8zIN9mRcC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Methods and Theories of Art History", "authors": ["Anne D'Alleva"], "publisher": "Laurence King Publishing", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "This is an analysis of complex forms of art history.

Its main argument is that under Napoleon, French history painting, especially battle painting, encountered a series of questions as to its nature andfunction. These questions arose in part from the (often contradictory) demand of a propaganda-machine operating within a postrevolutionary crisis of political legitimation, but also from changes in artistic taste which both retained and re-directed an earlier notion of the civic responsibilities ofthe history painter. This is a resolutely interdisciplinary book: drawing on perspectives from political thought and history, military theory and practice and art history, which centres on the work of the painter, Antoine-Jean Gros, and his controversial painting, La Bataille d'Eylau.`Detailed and highly intelligent . . . this book is a significant addition to the literature on French art of the early nineteenth century.'

This book explores why the ancient Greeks started to write art history and how the writing of art history transformed the social functions of art in the Greek world. It looks at the invention of the genre of portraiture and the social uses to which portraits were put in the city state. Later chapters explore how artists sought to enhance their status by writing theoretical treatises and producing works of art intended for purely aesthetic contemplation, which ultimately gave rise to the writing of art history and to the development of art collecting. The study, which is illustrated throughout and draws on contemporary perspectives in the sociology of art, will prompt the student of classical art to rethink fundamental assumptions about Greek art and its cultural and social implications.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521846141"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521846145"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 331, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmbctV2X-sEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmbctV2X-sEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qmbctV2X-sEC&pg=PA31&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qmbctV2X-sEC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Art_History_in_Ancient.html?hl=&id=qmbctV2X-sEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qmbctV2X-sEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "BpuOdmHOi3AC", "etag": "gAnj5WChGvM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BpuOdmHOi3AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A History of Arthurian Scholarship", "authors": ["Norris J.

It examines the uses that surrealist artists and writers made of ideas and images associated with the French Revolution, describing a complex relationship between surrealism's avant-garde revolt and its powerful sense of history and heritage. Focusing on both texts and images by key figures such as Louis Aragon, Georges Bataille, Jacques-Andr\u00e9 Boiffard, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Robert Desnos, Max Ernst, Max Morise, and Man Ray, this book situates surrealist material in the wider context of the literary and visual arts of the period through the theme of revolution. It raises important questions about the politics of representing French history, literary and political memorial spaces, monumental representations of the past and critical responses to them, imaginary portraiture and revolutionary spectatorship.

Harvey"], "publisher": "Univ. Press of Mississippi", "publishedDate": "1994", "description": "The comic strip was created by rival newspapers of the Hearst and the Pulitzer organizations as a device for increasing circulation. In the United States it quickly became an institution that soon spread worldwide as a favorite form of popular culture. What made the comic strip so enduring? This fascinating study by one of the few comics critics to develop sound critical principles by which to evaluate the comics as works of art and literature unfolds the history of the funnies and reveals the subtle art of how the comic strip blends words and pictures to make its impact. Together, these create meaning that neither conveys by itself. The Art of The Funnies offers a critical vocabulary for the appreciation of the newspaper comic strip as an art form and shows that full awareness of the artistry comes from considering both the verbal and the visual elements of the medium. The techniques of creating a comic strip - breaking down the narrative, composition of the panel, planning the layout - have remained constant since comic strips were originated. Since 1900 with Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland key cartoonists have relied on the union of words and pictures to give the funnies their continuing appeal. This art has persisted in such milestone achievements as Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff, George McManus's Bringing Up Father, Sidney Smith's The Gumps, Roy Crane's Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie, Chester Gould's Dick Tracy, Zack Mosley's Smilin' Jack, Harold Foster's Tarzan, Alex Raymond's Secret Agent X-9, Jungle Jim, and Flash Gordon, Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates, E. C. Segar's Popeye, George Herriman's Krazy Kat, and Walt Kelly's Pogo. In more recent times with Mort Walker's Beetle Bailey, Charles Schulz's Peanuts. Johnny Hart's B.C., T.K. Ryan's Tumbleweeds, Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury, and Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes, the artform has evolved with new developments, yet the aesthetics of the funnies remain basic. The Art of The Funnies unearths new information and weighs the influence of syndication upon the medium. Though the funnies go in ever new directions, perceiving the interdependency of words and pictures, as this book shows, remains the key to understanding the art.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0878056742"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780878056743"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 252, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.0.4.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sb374j7kI1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sb374j7kI1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb374j7kI1sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb374j7kI1sC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Art_of_the_Funnies.html?hl=&id=sb374j7kI1sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sb374j7kI1sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6NHus97wfY4C", "etag": "0OZYmAz+9gU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6NHus97wfY4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Natural History of the Traditional Quilt", "authors": ["John Forrest", "Deborah Blincoe"], "publisher": "University of Texas Press", "publishedDate": "2011-01-19", "description": "Traditional quilts serve many purposes over the course of a useful life. Beginning as a beautiful bed covering, a quilt may later function as a ground cover at picnics until years of wear relegate it to someone's ragbag for scrap uses. Observing this life cycle led authors John Forrest and Deborah Blincoe to the idea that quilts, like living things, have a natural history that can be studied scientifically. They explore that natural history through an examination of the taxonomy, morphology, behavior, and ecology of quilts in their native environment\u2014the homes of humans who make, use, keep, and bestow them. The taxonomy proposed by Forrest and Blincoe is rooted in the mechanics of replicating quilts so that it can be used to understand evolutionary and genetic relationships between quilt types. The morphology section anatomizes normal and abnormal physical features of quilts, while the section on conception and birth in the life cycle discusses how the underlying processes of replication intersect with environmental factors to produce tangible objects. This methodology is applicable to many kinds of crafts and will be of wide interest to students of folklore, anthropology, and art history.

Are computers really as antihistorical as they often seem? Drawing on phenomenology\u2019s investigation of time and history, Sensations of History uses encounters with new media art to inject more life into these questions, making profound contributions to our understanding of the digital age in the larger scope of history. Sensations of History combines close textual analysis of experimental new media artworks with in-depth discussions of key texts from the philosophical tradition of phenomenology. Through this inquiry, author James J. Hodge argues for the immense significance of new media art in examining just what historical experience means in a digital age. His beautiful, aphoristic style demystifies complex theories and ideas, making perplexing issues feel both graspable and intimate. Highlighting underappreciated, vibrant work in the fields of digital art and video, Sensations of History explores artists like Paul Chan, Phil Solomon, John F. Simon, and Barbara Lattanzi. Hodge\u2019s provocative interpretations, which bring these artists into dialogue with well-known works, are perfect for scholars of cinema, media studies, art history, and literary studies. Ultimately, Sensations of History presents the compelling case that we are not witnessing the end of history\u2014we are instead seeing its rejuvenation in a surprising variety of new media art.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781452960586"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1452960585"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 232, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT116&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2381.02, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2381.02, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-JW2uDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2381020000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2381020000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sensations_of_History-sample-epub.acsm?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sensations_of_History-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JW2uDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "H6TFV4sReMIC", "etag": "TSP5geSfoJk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/H6TFV4sReMIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Rethinking Art History", "subtitle": "Meditations on a Coy Science", "authors": ["Donald Preziosi"], "publisher": "Yale University Press", "publishedDate": "1989", "description": "A general overview of the theoretical and institutional history of the discipline of art history.

It places the profession in its social, academic, and political context and shows that historians of the period have been unfairly maligned as amateurish and primitive in comparison to their more celebrated successors. Pim den Boer begins by sketching the contours of French historiography in the nineteenth century, examining the quantity of historical writing, its subject matter, and who wrote it. He traces the growing influence of professional historians. He shows the increasing involvement of the national government in historical studies, paying special attention to the impact of political factions, ranging from ultraroyalists to radical republicans. He explores how historical research and teaching changed at schools and universities. And he shows how nineteenth-century historians' keen understanding of the past and of historical methodology laid the foundations for historiography in the twentieth century. archives, including official documents, confidential reports, and personal letters. Den Boer makes use of statistical, biographical, and methodological analysis and demonstrates comprehensive knowledge of both minor historians and leading scholars, including Charles Seignobos and Charles-Victor Langlois.

The articles explore the representation of history in manga from disciplines that include such diverse fields as literary studies, politics, history, cultural studies, linguistics, narratology, and semiotics. Despite this diversity of approaches all academics from these respective fields of study agree that manga pose a peculiarly contemporary appeal that transcends the limitation imposed by traditional approaches to the study and teaching of history. The representation of history via manga in Japan has a long and controversial historiographical dimension. Thereby manga and by extension graphic art in Japanese culture has become one of the world's most powerful modes of expressing contemporary historical verisimilitude. The strategy of combining the narrative elements of writing with graphic art, the extensive narrative story-manga and its Western equivalent of the graphic novel, reflects the relatively new soft power of 'global' media, which have the potential to display history in previously unimagined ways. Boundaries of space and time in manga become as permeable as societies and cultures across the world. Each of the articles in this book investigates the authorship of history by looking at various different attempts to render Japanese history through the popular cultural media of the story-manga. As Carol Gluck, Tessa Morris-Suzuki, Susan Napier and others have shown, it has never been easyto encapsulate the complex narrative of emperor-based cyclical Japanese historical periods. The contributors to this volume elaborate how manga and by extension graphic art rewrites, reinvents and re-imagines the historicity and dialectic of bygone epochs in postwar/contemporary Japan. \"--", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415694230"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "041569423X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 273, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3lsmpp29FFoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3lsmpp29FFoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3lsmpp29FFoC&pg=PA1&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3lsmpp29FFoC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Manga_and_the_Representation_of_Japanese.html?hl=&id=3lsmpp29FFoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3lsmpp29FFoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "1dmIih8Zk2AC", "etag": "URNrmDka9d4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1dmIih8Zk2AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Technologies of History", "subtitle": "Visual Media and the Eccentricity of the Past", "authors": ["Steve F.

Photography, History, Difference brings together an international group of scholars to reflect on contemporary efforts to take a different approach to photography and its histories. What are the benefits and challenges of writing a consolidated, global history of photography? How do they compare with those of producing more circumscribed regional or thematic histories? In what ways does the recent emphasis on geographic and national specificity encourage or exclude attention to other forms of difference, such as race, class, gender, and sexuality? Do studies of \"other\" photographies ultimately necessitate the adoption of nontraditional methodologies, or are there contexts in which such differentiation can be intellectually unproductive and politically suspect? The contributors to the volume explore these and other questions through historical case studies; interpretive surveys of recent historiography, criticism, and museum practices; and creative proposals to rethink the connections between photography, history, and difference.

Demanding frankly the referential detachment of the objects under study, the book proposes a stratified, multi-causal account of art history that addresses postmodern concerns while saving it from its errors of self-refutation. Building from the very basic distinction between intransitive being and transitive knowing, objects can be affirmed as real while our knowledge of them is held to be fallible. Several focused chapters address basic problems while introducing philosophical reflection into art history. These include basic ontological distinctions between society and culture, general and \u201cspecial\u201d history, the discontinuity of cultural objects, the importance of definition for special history, scales, facets and fiat objects as forms of historical structure, the nature of evidence and proof, historical truth and controversies. Stressing Critical Realism as the stratified, multi-causal approach needed for productive research today in the academy, this book creates the subject of the ontology of art history and sets aside a theoretical space for metaphysical reflection, thus clarifying the usually muddy distinction between theory, methodology, and historiography in art history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415531511"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415531519"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 168, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O9zCpcV1lZUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O9zCpcV1lZUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=O9zCpcV1lZUC&pg=PA43&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=O9zCpcV1lZUC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Realist_Theory_of_Art_History.html?hl=&id=O9zCpcV1lZUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=O9zCpcV1lZUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EQkeAAAAQBAJ", "etag": "3VXkwnSe1cQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EQkeAAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Oral History in the Visual Arts", "authors": ["Matthew Partington", "Linda Sandino"], "publisher": "A&amp;C Black", "publishedDate": "2013-08-15", "description": "Interviews are becoming an increasingly dominant research method in art, craft, design, fashion and textile history.

Although regarded as an essential element of fashionable dress from the Renaissance into the twentieth century, the corset was also frequently condemned as an instrument of torture and the cause of ill health. Why did women continue to don steel and whalebone corsets for four hundred years? And why did they finally stop? This book offers fascinating and often surprising answers to these questions. Valerie Steele, one of the world\u2019s most respected fashion historians, explores the cultural history of the corset, demolishing myths about this notorious garment and revealing new information and perspectives on its changing significance over the centuries. Whereas most historians have framed the history of the corset in terms of oppression vs. liberation and fashion vs. health and comfort, Steele contends that women\u2019s experiences of corsetry varied considerably and cannot be fully understood within these narrow frames. Drawing on extensive research in textual, visual, and materials sources, the author disproves the beliefs that the corset was dangerously unhealthy and was designed primarily for the oppression of women. Women persisted in wearing corsets - despite powerful male authorities trying to dissuade them - because corsetry had positive connotations of social status, self-discipline, youth, and beauty. In the twentieth century the garment itself fell out of fashion but, Steele points out, it has become internalized as women replace the boned corset with diet, exercise, and plastic surgery.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780300099539"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0300099533"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 199, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uk6I0-MDXVQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uk6I0-MDXVQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uk6I0-MDXVQC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uk6I0-MDXVQC&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Corset.html?hl=&id=uk6I0-MDXVQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uk6I0-MDXVQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Dau0AAAAIAAJ", "etag": "nJq8knH8zbg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Dau0AAAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Tattoo History", "subtitle": "A Source Book : an Anthology of Historical Records of Tattooing Throughout the World", "authors": ["Steve Gilbert"], "publisher": "powerHouse Books", "publishedDate": "2000", "description": "An exhaustingly thorough, lavishly illustrated collection of historical records of tattooing throughout the world, from ancient times to the present.

Yet there are other traces of the past available to historians: the material things that people have chosen, made, and used. This book examines how material culture can enhance historians' understanding of the past, both worldwide and across time. The successful use of material culture in history depends on treating material things of many kinds not as illustrations, but as primary evidence. Each kind of material thing-and there are many-requires the application of interpretive skills appropriate to it. These skills overlap with those acquired by scholars in disciplines that may abut history but are often relatively unfamiliar to historians, including anthropology, archaeology, and art history. Creative historians can adapt and apply the same skills they honed while studying more traditional text-based documents even as they borrow methods from these fields. They can think through familiar historical problems in new ways. They can also deploy material culture to discover the pasts of constituencies who have left few or no traces in written records. The authors of this volume contribute case studies arranged thematically in six sections that respectively address the relationship of history and material culture to cognition, technology, the symbolic, social distinction, and memory. They range across time and space, from Paleolithic to Punk.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780197500125"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0197500129"}],

Books such as The Hare with Amber Eyes and A History of the World in 100 Objects indicate the growing popularity of this way of understanding the past. In History and Its Objects, Peter N. Miller uncovers the forgotten origins of our fascination with exploring the past through its artifacts by highlighting the role of antiquarianism\u2014a pursuit ignored and derided by modem academic history\u2014in grasping the significance of material culture.From the efforts of Renaissance antiquarians, who reconstructed life in the ancient world from coins, inscriptions, seals, and other detritus, to amateur historians in the nineteenth century working within burgeoning national traditions, Miller connects collecting\u2014whether by individuals or institutions\u2014to the professionalization of the historical profession, one which came to regard its progenitors with skepticism and disdain. The struggle to articulate the value of objects as historical evidence, then, lies at the heart both of academic history-writing and of the popular engagement with things. Ultimately, this book demonstrates that our current preoccupation with objects is far from novel and reflects a human need to reexperience the past as a physical presence.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781501708244"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1501708244"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 312, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Antiques & Collectibles"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nbi8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nbi8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nbi8DgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nbi8DgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Art+History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/History_and_Its_Objects.html?hl=&id=Nbi8DgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Nbi8DgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "hl-4BQAAQBAJ", "etag": "FqcLLLybQvs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hl-4BQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A History of Greek Art", "authors": ["Mark D.

Each section focuses on a key issue: art as history; aesthetics; form, content, and style; anthropology; meaning and interpretation; authorship and identity; and the phenomenon of globalization.
