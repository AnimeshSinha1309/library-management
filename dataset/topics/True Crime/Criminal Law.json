It emphasises, in contrast to orthodox texts, the tensions and contradictions at the law's heart. The author outlines the themes of responsibility, rationality and justice which govern the orthodox criminal law text. He traces these to the early nineteenth century reform of the criminal law and notes conflicts within reform ideologies relating to the idea of the 'responsible individual'. He then takes the reader through the bulk of the criminal law's 'general part' showing how conflicts from reform ideology emerge within criminal law. An historical and political logic underlies its illogicalities, giving it its 'shape'. The author presents a sceptical critique of the liberal positivist tradition in criminal law scholarship, and a social analysis of both its practical necessity and intellectual impossibility. He shows how the ideology of individual legal justice was imposed as a means of excluding alternative political voices, while recognising its importance for the survival of the liberal polity.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521606012"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521606011"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Y9A_yy2ub8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Y9A_yy2ub8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_Y9A_yy2ub8C&pg=PA26&dq=subject:Criminal+Law&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_Y9A_yy2ub8C&dq=subject:Criminal+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Crime_Reason_and_History.html?hl=&id=_Y9A_yy2ub8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_Y9A_yy2ub8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZgSgQgAACAAJ", "etag": "ozLX3PESEfc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZgSgQgAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Law of Extradition and Mutual Assistance", "subtitle": "International Criminal Law, Practice and Procedure", "authors": ["Clive Nicholls", "Clare Montgomery", "Julian B.

But what does it mean when imprisonment and evangelization actually go hand in hand, or at least appear to? What do \"faith-based\" prison programs mean for the constitutional separation of church and state, particularly when prisoners who participate get special privileges? In Prison Religion, law and religion scholar Winnifred Fallers Sullivan takes up these and other important questions through a close examination of a recent trial challenging the constitutionality of a faith-based residential rehabilitation program in an Iowa state prison, a trial in which she served as an expert witness for the prisoner-plaintiffs. Using the trial to illuminate the interrelationship of American law and religion today, Prison Religion argues that the plaintiffs' case unintentionally shows that separation of church and state is no longer possible because religious authority has radically shifted from institutions to individuals, making it difficult to define religion, let alone disentangle it from the state. In the course of advancing this unconventional view, Prison Religion casts new light on church-state law, the debate over government-funded faith-based programs, and the predicament of prisoners who have precious little choice about what kind of rehabilitation they receive, if they are offered any at all.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "069113359X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780691133591"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 305, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DBjDoQijEdIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DBjDoQijEdIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DBjDoQijEdIC&pg=PA227&dq=subject:Criminal+Law&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DBjDoQijEdIC&dq=subject:Criminal+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Prison_Religion.html?hl=&id=DBjDoQijEdIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Prison_Religion-sample-epub.acsm?id=DBjDoQijEdIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Prison_Religion-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DBjDoQijEdIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DBjDoQijEdIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Jbk_AAAAIAAJ", "etag": "eidFqQ/CDNE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Jbk_AAAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Treatise on the Law of Crimes (Clark & Marshall)", "authors": ["William Lawrence Clark", "William Lawrence Marshall", "Melvin F.

Its success over numerous editions, both at community colleges as well as in four-year college criminal justice programs, is proof this text works as an authoritative source on criminal law as well as a teaching text that communicates with students. The book covers substantive criminal law and explores its principles, sources, distinctions, and limitations. Definitions and elements of crimes are explained, and defenses to crimes are thoroughly analyzed.

This book provides a comprehensive, accessible yet analytically challenging account of the institutional and legal developments in this field to date.

While, broadly speaking, the authors welcome the objectives of EU criminal law, they call for a profound rethinking of how the good of criminal justice however defined is to be delivered to those living in the EU. At present, despite sometimes commendable initiatives from the institutions responsible, the actual framing and implementation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) suffers from a failure to properly consider the theoretical implications of providing the good of criminal justice at the EU level.

Schonsheck"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "1994-01-31", "description": "When thinking about justified criminalization - whether some action may morally be made a criminal offense - philosophers tend to rely upon `balancing'. Arguments favoring and opposing criminalization are `weighed' on a simple beam balance; the `weightier' reasons prevail. Jonathan Schonsheck argues that this methodology is deeply flawed; among other infirmities, it fosters the neglect of items essential to a defensible decision. He urges the adoption of `filtering' - a multi-step procedure which directs one to discuss the moral authority of the state, to consider measures less coercive than a criminal statute, and to investigate the pragmatic consequences of criminalization. This procedure, he argues, imposes a structure on disputes which facilitates philosophical progress. `Filtering' is then applied to an array of public policy issues, including laws which require the use of automobile seat belts and motorcycle helmets, and laws which prohibit the use of certain psychoactive substances (`drugs'). Additionally, the book addresses a number of more theoretical issues in the philosophy of the criminal law. Throughout, it engages the work of leading philosophers: Derek Parfit, Cass R.

Arneson, and especially Joel Feinberg.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0792326636"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780792326632"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 312, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UzRRtZJIo_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UzRRtZJIo_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UzRRtZJIo_YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UzRRtZJIo_YC&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Criminalization.html?hl=&id=UzRRtZJIo_YC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/On_Criminalization-sample-epub.acsm?id=UzRRtZJIo_YC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/On_Criminalization-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UzRRtZJIo_YC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UzRRtZJIo_YC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Throughout, it engages the work of leading philosophers: Derek Parfit, Cass R.

As global society grows ever more interdependent, international crime is increasingly regarded as a serious threat. Now is the time for the international community to produce more comprehensive solutions to prevent, punish & deter crimes under international law. In this book, the author focuses on recent developments in codification & implementation to evaluate prospects for the emergence of a unified system of international criminal law, characterized by broad & coherent material coverage, as well as fair & effective institutional implementation. To this end, he sketches the normative contours of international criminal law by exploring the history, content & legal status of the relevant norms against the background of the work of the International Law Commission. He then surveys patterns in existing means of implementation at both the inter-State & international levels, examining key issues relating to the acquisition of custody over the alleged offender, the role of the extradition system & the use of international criminal tribunals. Finally, the author identifies the essential properties for the emergence of a good system of international criminal law & locates the development & future prospects of this field within the main historical dynamics of international legal cooperation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9041104720"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789041104724"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 486, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dbb8eQH-vbQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dbb8eQH-vbQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dbb8eQH-vbQC&pg=PA229&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&cd=84&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dbb8eQH-vbQC&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Emerging_System_of_International_Cri.html?hl=&id=Dbb8eQH-vbQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Dbb8eQH-vbQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "CHAPTER IV ADVENT OF NORMATIVE HIERARCHY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW <br>\nAND ITS RELATION TO INDIVIDUAL CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY In order for <br>\n<b>criminal law</b> to function as an effective system, there must exist a legal authority&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "-9q0UguDPI8C", "etag": "PMV4JI+Lowg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/-9q0UguDPI8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Mental Condition in Criminal Law", "subtitle": "Forensic Psychiatric and Psychological Assessment in a Residential Setting", "authors": ["Frans Koenraadt", "Antoine Willem Michiel Mooij", "Jos Mooij"], "publisher": "Rozenberg Publishers", "publishedDate": "2007-12-31", "description": "In the Netherlands the vast majority of forensic mental health assessment on an in-patient basis is carried out at the Pieter Baan Centre, Utrecht, which has the legal status of a house of detention and observation centre.

It offers an account of how the rules and principles found within legal materials provide practical opportunities for responding to, rather than merely following the law. This opens up a richer notion of legal doctrine than has been acknowledged in earlier representations of the workings of legal rules and principles. It also leads to a rejection of some of the established views on the roles of judges and academics, and provides the incentive for a more rigorous assessment of the serious challenge made by a 'critical' perspective on the criminal law. The intimate connection between the use of legal materials and the practice of definition is explored through a number of detailed studies. These deal with some of the apparently intractable problems concerning the definition of theft, and changes to the definition of recklessness culminating in the recent decision of the House of Lords in R v G. Theoretical insights on the different features of the process of definition and a remodelling of culpability issues are combined to question the conventional intellectual apparatus of the criminal law. The approach developed within the book offers a more realistic appraisal of the feasibility of reform, and of expectations for the principle of legality within the criminal law.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781841130712"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1841130710"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 219, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ejtsLYICiDcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ejtsLYICiDcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ejtsLYICiDcC&pg=PA187&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ejtsLYICiDcC&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Definition_in_the_Criminal_Law.html?hl=&id=ejtsLYICiDcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Definition_in_the_Criminal_Law-sample-epub.acsm?id=ejtsLYICiDcC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ejtsLYICiDcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Criminal.

Fletcher"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "1998-09-03", "description": "In the United States today criminal justice can vary from state to state, as various states alter the Modern Penal Code to suit their own local preferences and concerns. In Eastern Europe, the post-Communist countries are quickly adopting new criminal codes to reflect their specific national concerns as they gain autonomy from what was once a centralized Soviet policy. As commonalities among countries and states disintegrate, how are we to view the basic concepts of criminal law as a whole? Eminent legal scholar George Fletcher acknowledges that criminal law is becoming increasingly localized, with every country and state adopting their own conception of punishable behavior, determining their own definitions of offenses. Yet by taking a step back from the details and linguistic variations of the criminal codes, Fletcher is able to perceive an underlying unity among diverse systems of criminal justice. Challenging common assumptions, he discovers a unity that emerges not on the surface of statutory rules and case law but in the underlying debates that inform them. Basic Concepts of Criminal Law identifies a set of twelve distinctions that shape and guide the controversies that inevitably break out in every system of criminal justice. Devoting a chapter to each of these twelve concepts, Fletcher maps out what he considers to be the deep structure of all systems of criminal law. Understanding these distinctions will not only enable students to appreciate the universal fundamental ideas of criminal law, but will enable them to understand the significance of local details and variations. This accessible illustration of the unity of diverse systems of criminal justice will provoke and inform students and scholars of law and the philosophy of law, as well as lawyers seeking a better understanding of the law they practice.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199729212"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199729210"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&pg=PA3&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 980.99, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 490.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&rdid=book-eCa55NQ8UpIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 980990000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 490500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basic_Concepts_of_Criminal_Law-sample-epub.acsm?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basic_Concepts_of_Criminal_Law-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eCa55NQ8UpIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Criminal law</b> has become codified law.

Here in English translation is the Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure of the largest of the fifteen Soviet Republics--containing the basic criminal law of the Soviet Union and virtually the entire criminal law applicable in Russia--and the Law on Court Organization. These two codes and the Law, which went into effect o January 1, 1961, are among the chief products of the Soviet law reform movement which began after Stalin's death, and are a concrete reflection of the effort to establish legality and prevent a return to Stalinist arbitrariness and terror. In a long introductory essay Harold Berman, a leading authority on Soviet law, stresses the extent to which the codes are expressed in authentic soviet legal language, based in part on the pre-Revolutionary Russian past but oriented to Soviet concepts, conditions, and policies. He outlines the historical background of the new codes, with a detailed listing of the major changes reflected in them, interprets their significance, places them within the system of Soviet law as a whole, and discusses some of the principal similarities and differences between Soviet criminal law and procedure and that of Western Europe and of the United States.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0674826361"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780674826366"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 399, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC&pg=PA106&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC&dq=Criminal+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Soviet_Criminal_Law_and_Procedure.html?hl=&id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Soviet_Criminal_Law_and_Procedure-sample-epub.acsm?id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Nx0gnXpMbnsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "9 The Role of the Legal Profession in <b>Criminal Law</b> and Procedure All Soviet <br>\nlegal personnel \u2014 procurators, judges, jurisconsults, advocates, law professors, <br>\nlegal research workers, and others \u2014 are called &quot;jurists&quot; (iuristy), as, indeed, are <br>\nall&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CS8Axu2ewRIC", "etag": "6qn7sXHO/3U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CS8Axu2ewRIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "International Criminal Law", "authors": ["Bantekas", "Dr Susan Nash"], "publisher": "Cavendish Publishing", "publishedDate": "2003-09-09", "description": "This book explores criminal issues from an international law perspective.

It is designed for anyone interested in exploring the basics of criminal law for personal, academic, or professional reasons. High-profile criminal trials have placed criminal law in the national spotlight. While these trials may contain straightforward factual circumstances, often the legal issues surrounding the criminal charges and defenses are complex and confusing. This book explains the basics of criminal law in an easy-to-understand format designed especially for the nonlawyer who has an interest in criminal law. The book approaches criminal law by discussing basic crimes and their elements to help readers understand the necessary requirements for charging and prosecuting crimes. To aid in understanding many of the concepts, the book includes numerous hypothetical situations that place some of the more difficult concepts in an everyday context, thereby making them more understandable.

Although current plea bargaining practices may be theoretically unsupportable and can give rise to severe victim dissatisfaction, the author argues that the practice is justified as a means of increasing the proportion of international offenders who can be prosecuted.

This is the first text to bridge both fields as it presents psychological research and theory relevant to each phase of criminal justice processes. The materials are divided into three parts that follow a comprehensive introduction. The introduction analyses the major legal themes and values that guide criminal justice processes and points to the many psychological issues they raise. Part I examines how the legal system investigates and apprehends criminal suspects. Topics range from the identification, searching and seizing to the questioning of suspects. Part II focuses on how the legal system establishes guilt. To do so, it centres on the process of bargaining and pleading cases, assembling juries, providing expert witnesses, and considering defendants' mental states.

It fosters discussions of controversial issues and delivers abridged case law decisions that target the essence of appellate rulings. Grounded in the model penal code, making the text national in scope, this volume examines: Why the criminal codes originated, and the moral, religious, spiritual, and human influences that led to our present system How crimes are described in the modern criminal justice model The two essential elements necessary for criminal culpability: actus reus (the act committed or omitted) and mens rea (the mind and intent of the actor) Offenses against the body resulting in death, including murder, manslaughter, felony murder, and negligent homicide Nonterminal criminal conduct against the body, including robbery, kidnapping, false imprisonment, assault, and hate crimes Sexual assault, rape, necrophilia, incest, and child molestation Property offenses, such as larceny/theft, bribery, forgery, and embezzlement Crimes against the home, including burglary, trespass, arson, and vandalism The book also examines controversial public morality issues such as prostitution, drug legalization, obscenity, and pornography. The final two chapters discuss inchoate offenses, where the criminal act has not been completed, and various criminal defenses such as legal insanity, entrapment, coercion, self-defense, and mistake of fact or law.

On the one hand, the criminal process is based on the protection of society; on the other hand, human rights implies respect for all individuals implicated in that process, be they victim, witness or accused. A third difficulty arises in relation to the new influence of European law. While the right to judge has long appeared to be the most obvious indication of national sovereignty, it is now subject to supranational control & a State can be censured by the European Court of Human Rights. Part One of this volume analyses the period of reform in various Eastern & Western European countries; Part Two explores the debate among jurists, historians, sociologists & philosophers on the subject of the criminal trial in a democratic society. Finally, Part Three reflects on the issue within the context of the European Community & the European Council & explores the question of a future model for the European criminal trial.
