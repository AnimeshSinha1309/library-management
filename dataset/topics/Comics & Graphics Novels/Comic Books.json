Along the way you will meet the hustlers, hucksters, hacks, and visionaries who made the American comic book what it is today.

A wide range of comic/film adaptations are explored, including superheroes (Spider-Man), comic strips (Dick Tracy), realist and autobiographical comics (American Splendor, Ghost World), and photo-montage comics (Mexico's El Santo). Essayists discuss films beginning with the 1978 Superman. That success led filmmakers to adapt a multitude of comic books for the screen including Marvel's Uncanny X-Men, the Amazing Spider-Man, Blade, and the Incredible Hulk as well as alternative graphic novels such as From Hell, V for Vendetta, and Road to Perdition.

At times the connection is cosmetic-as perhaps with Wonder Woman's Amazonian heritage-and at times it is almost irrelevant-as with Hercules' starfaring adventures in the 1982 Marvel miniseries. But all of these make implicit or explicit claims about the place of classics in modern literary culture. Classics and Comics is the first book to explore the engagement of classics with the epitome of modern popular literature, the comic book. This volume collects sixteen articles, all specially commissioned for this volume, that look at how classical content is deployed in comics and reconfigured for a modern audience. It opens with a detailed historical introduction surveying the role of classical material in comics since the 1930s. Subsequent chapters cover a broad range of topics, including the incorporation of modern theories of myth into the creation and interpretation of comic books, the appropriation of characters from classical literature and myth, and the reconfiguration of motif into a modern literary medium. Among the well-known comics considered in the collection are Frank Miller's 300 and Sin City, DC Comics' Wonder Woman, Jack Kirby's The Eternals, Neil Gaiman's Sandman, and examples of Japanese manga. The volume also includes an original 12-page \"comics-essay,\" drawn and written by Eisner Award-winning Eric Shanower, creator of the graphic novel series Age of Bronze.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199734191"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199734194"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 265, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LuUVDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LuUVDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LuUVDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LuUVDAAAQBAJ&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Classics_and_Comics.html?hl=&id=LuUVDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LuUVDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This volume collects sixteen articles, all specially commissioned for this volume, that look at how classical content is deployed in comics and reconfigured for a modern audience."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WOdlDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "iPXJnueU4ZI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WOdlDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "1000 Facts about Comic Books Vol. 3", "authors": ["James Egan"], "publisher": "Lulu.com", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780244606299"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0244606293"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WOdlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WOdlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WOdlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WOdlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/1000_Facts_about_Comic_Books_Vol_3.html?hl=&id=WOdlDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WOdlDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "XKhgy4xU5e8C", "etag": "jSFNhZUprm0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/XKhgy4xU5e8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Comic Books as History", "subtitle": "The Narrative Art of Jack Jackson, Art Spiegelman, and Harvey Pekar", "authors": ["Joseph Witek"], "publisher": "Univ.

The book intertwines aesthetic issues and critical biographies with the concerns of production, distribution, and audience reception, making it one of the few interdisciplinary studies of the art form. A thorough introduction by translators and comics scholars Bart Beaty and Nick Nguyen brings the book up to date with explorations of the latest innovations, particularly the graphic novel. The book is organized into three sections: a concise history of the evolution of the comic book form in America; an overview of the distribution and consumption of American comic books, detailing specific controversies such as the creation of the Comics Code in the mid-1950s; and the problematic legitimization of the form that has occurred recently within the academy and in popular discourse. Viewing comic books from a variety of theoretical lenses, Gabilliet shows how seemingly disparate issues\u2014creation, production, and reception\u2014are in fact connected in ways that are not necessarily true of other art forms. Analyzing examples from a variety of genres, this book provides a thorough landmark overview of American comic books that sheds new light on this versatile art form.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781628469998"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1628469994"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yOujDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yOujDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yOujDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yOujDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yOujDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2642.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2403.25, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yOujDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yOujDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2642300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2403250000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yOujDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Originally published in France and long sought in English translation, Jean-Paul Gabilliet&#39;s Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books documents the rise and development of the American comic book industry from the 1930s ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2GNaoeiY51EC", "etag": "HqqGooZb1zI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2GNaoeiY51EC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Icons of the American Comic Book", "subtitle": "From Captain America to Wonder Woman", "authors": ["Randy Duncan", "Matthew J.

In Heroines of Comic Books and Literature: Portrayals in Popular Culture, editors Maja Bajac-Carter, Norma Jones, and Bob Batchelor have selected essays by award-winning contributors that offer a variety of perspectives on the representations of heroines in today\u2019s society. Focused on printed media, this collection looks at heroic women depicted in literature, graphic novels, manga, and comic books. Addressing heroines from such sources as the Marvel and DC comic universes, manga, and the Twilight novels, contributors go beyond the account of women as mothers, wives, warriors, goddesses, and damsels in distress. These engaging and important essays situate heroines within culture, revealing them as tough and self-sufficient females who often break the bounds of gender expectations in places readers may not expect. Analyzing how women are and have been represented in print, this companion volume to Heroines of Film and Television will appeal to scholars of literature, rhetoric, and media as well as to broader audiences that are interested in portrayals of women in popular culture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781442231481"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1442231483"}],

Practitioners of both traditional religions and new religious movements have begun to employ comics as a missionary tool, while humanists and religious progressives use comics' unique fusion of text and image to criticize traditional theologies and to offer alternatives. Addressing the increasing fervor with which the public has come to view comics as an art form and Americans' fraught but passionate relationship with religion, Graven Images explores with real insight the roles of religion in comic books and graphic novels. In essays by scholars and comics creators, Graven Images observes the frequency with which religious material\u0097in devout, educational, satirical, or critical contexts\u0097occurs in both independent and mainstream comics. Contributors identify the unique advantages of the comics medium for religious messages; analyze how comics communicate such messages; place the religious messages contained in comic books in appropriate cultural, social, and historical frameworks; and articulate the significance of the innovative theologies being developed in comics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780826430267"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0826430260"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 366, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Graven_Images.html?hl=&id=X1QGu16o0OoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Graven_Images-sample-epub.acsm?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Addressing the increasing fervor with which the public has come to view comics as an art form and Americans&#39;

Gilmore", "Matthias Stork"], "publisher": "Rowman & Littlefield", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06", "description": "In the age of digital media, superheroes are no longer confined to comic books and graphic novels. Their stories are now featured in films, video games, digital comics, television programs, and more. In a single year alone, films featuring Batman, Spider-Man, and the Avengers have appeared on the big screen. Popular media no longer exists in isolation, but converges into complex multidimensional entities. As a result, traditional ideas about the relationship between varying media have come under striking revision. Although this convergence is apparent in many genres, perhaps nowhere is it more persistent, more creative, or more varied than in the superhero genre. Superhero Synergies: Comic Book Characters Go Digital explores this developing relationship between superheroes and various forms of media, examining how the superhero genre, which was once limited primarily to a single medium, has been developed into so many more. Essays in this volume engage with several of the most iconic heroes\u2014including Batman, Hulk, and Iron Man\u2014through a variety of academic disciplines such as industry studies, gender studies, and aesthetic analysis to develop an expansive view of the genre\u2019s potency. The contributors to this volume engage cinema, comics, video games, and even live stage shows to instill readers with new ways of looking at, thinking about, and experiencing some of contemporary media\u2019s most popular texts. This unique approach to the examination of digital media and superhero studies provides new and valuable readings of well-known texts and practices. Intended for both academics and fans of the superhero genre, this anthology introduces the innovative and growing synergy between traditional comic books and digital media.", "industryIdentifiers":

Many of the stories written and drawn by people like Carl Barks (Donald Duck, Uncle Scrooge), John Stanley (Little Lulu), and Walt Kelly (Pogo) repay reading and rereading by educated adults even today, decades after they were published as disposable entertainment for children. Such triumphs were improbable, to say the least, because midcentury comics were so widely dismissed as trash by angry parents, indignant librarians, and even many of the people who published them. It was all but miraculous that a few great cartoonists were able to look past that nearly universal scorn and grasp the artistic potential of their medium. With clarity and enthusiasm, Barrier explains what made the best stories in the Dell comic books so special.

This trend, now in its second decade, has blossomed into Hollywood's leading genre. From superheroes to Spartan warriors, The Comic Book Film Adaptation offers the first dedicated study to examine how comic books moved from the fringes of popular culture to the center of mainstream film production. Through in-depth analysis, industry interviews, and audience research, this book charts the cause-and-effect of this influential trend. It considers the cultural traumas, business demands, and digital possibilities that Hollywood faced at the dawn of the twenty-first century. The industry managed to meet these challenges by exploiting comics and their existing audiences. However, studios were caught off-guard when these comic book fans, empowered by digital media, began to influence the success of these adaptations. Nonetheless, filmmakers soon developed strategies to take advantage of this intense fanbase, while codifying the trend into a more lucrative genre, the comic book movie, which appealed to an even wider audience. Central to this vibrant trend is a comic aesthetic in which filmmakers utilize digital filmmaking technologies to engage with the language and conventions of comics like never before. The Comic Book Film Adaptation explores this unique moment in which cinema is stimulated, challenged, and enriched by the once-dismissed medium of comics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781626745155"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1626745153"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r4zdBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r4zdBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=r4zdBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r4zdBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r4zdBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2642.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2399.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r4zdBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-r4zdBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2642300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2399200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=r4zdBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The Comic Book Film Adaptation explores this unique moment in which cinema is stimulated, challenged, and enriched by the once-dismissed medium of comics."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "fm8mRsBP3YkC", "etag": "NwLO+QcBILs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fm8mRsBP3YkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Comics", "authors": ["Coulton Waugh"], "publisher": "Univ.

Essays take diverse theoretical perspectives such as cultural studies, political economy, feminist criticism, queer studies, and mythic analysis, all focusing on the relationship of comics to issues of social division.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0820452491"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780820452494"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 303, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7vdlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7vdlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7vdlAAAAMAAJ&q=Comic+Books&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=44&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7vdlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Comics_Ideology.html?hl=&id=7vdlAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7vdlAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Superman&#39;s role in romanticizing commercialism; sexual violence in Japanese manga comics; Wonder Woman as Americanized immigrant; reader&#39;s reactions to the gay superhero Northstar; Dilbert as a workplace revolutionary; the Punisher&#39;s ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "z70bAQAAIAAJ", "etag": "r1IOUMP18zA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/z70bAQAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ron Goulart's Great History of Comic Books", "authors": ["Ron Goulart"], "publisher": "McGraw-Hill/Contemporary", "publishedDate": "1986", "description": "Looks at individual publishers, comic book genres, characters, and trends in comic book stories and artwork", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "STANFORD:36105038079757"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 314, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z70bAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z70bAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=z70bAQAAIAAJ&q=Comic+Books&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=45&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=z70bAQAAIAAJ&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Ron_Goulart_s_Great_History_of_Comic_Boo.html?hl=&id=z70bAQAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=z70bAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Looks at individual publishers, comic book genres, characters, and trends in comic book stories and artwork"}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "SSM4r36KjuQC", "etag": "/9stcoeNyBQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/SSM4r36KjuQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Illustrating Asia", "subtitle": "Comics, Humor Magazines, and Picture Books", "authors": ["John A.

Katsion, James J. Kimble, Christina M. Knopf, Steven E. Martin, Brad Palmer, Elliott Sawyer, Deborah Clark Vance, David E. Wilt, and Zou Yizheng One of the most overlooked aspects of the Allied war effort involved a surprising initiative--comic book propaganda. Even before Pearl Harbor, the comic book industry enlisted its formidable army of artists, writers, and editors to dramatize the conflict for readers of every age and interest. Comic book superheroes and everyday characters modeled positive behaviors and encouraged readers to keep scrapping. Ultimately, those characters proved to be persuasive icons in the war's most colorful and indelible propaganda campaign. The 10 Cent War presents a riveting analysis of how different types of comic books and comic book characters supplied reasons and means to support the war. The contributors demonstrate that, free of government control, these appeals produced this overall imperative. The book discusses the role of such major characters as Superman, Wonder Woman, and Uncle Sam along with a host of such minor characters as kid gangs and superhero sidekicks. It even considers novelty and small presses, providing a well-rounded look at the many ways that comic books served as popular propaganda.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781496810311"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1496810317"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dbnPDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dbnPDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dbnPDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dbnPDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dbnPDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2642.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2268.12, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dbnPDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-dbnPDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2642300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2268120000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dbnPDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book discusses the role of such major characters as Superman, Wonder Woman, and Uncle Sam along with a host of such minor characters as kid gangs and superhero sidekicks."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QQB1LQAACAAJ", "etag": "iGKF40MBSKM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QQB1LQAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How to Draw Dynamic Comic Books", "authors": ["Rich Buckler", "Rich Boyette"], "publisher": "Vanguard", "publishedDate": "2007-08", "description": "The well-known comic book artist offers tips on creating original heroic figures and comics, including advice on the language of storytelling and narrative technique.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1934331074"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781934331071"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QQB1LQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QQB1LQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QQB1LQAACAAJ&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QQB1LQAACAAJ&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Draw_Dynamic_Comic_Books.html?hl=&id=QQB1LQAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QQB1LQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The well-known comic book artist offers tips on creating original heroic figures and comics, including advice on the language of storytelling and narrative technique."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CYP2Cj_Gb98C", "etag": "R75h/smEQPk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CYP2Cj_Gb98C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book", "subtitle": "Unmasking the Myth of Modernity", "authors": ["Tom Andrae"], "publisher": "Univ.

Press of Mississippi", "publishedDate": "2007", "description": "Sixty years before the comics entered the American newspaper press, Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer of Geneva (1799-1846), schoolmaster, university professor, polemical journalist, art critic, landscape draftsman, and writer of fiction, travel tales, and social criticism, invented a new art form: the comic strip, or \"picture story,\" that is now the graphic novel. At first he resisted publishing what he called his \"little follies.\" When he did, they became instantly popular, plagiarized, and imitated throughout Europe and the United States. T\u00f6pffer developed a graphic style suited to his poor eyesight: the doodle, which he systematized and also theorized. The drawings, with their \"modernist\" spontaneous, flickering, broken lines, forming figures in mad hyperactivity, run above deft, ironic captions and propel narratives of surreal absurdity. The artist's maniacal protagonists mix social satire with myth. By the mid-nineteenth century, Messrs. Jabot, Festus, Cryptogame, and other members of the crazy family, comprising eight picture stories in all, were instant folk heroes. In a biographical framework, Kunzle situates the comic strips in the Genevan and European culture of the time as well as in relation to T\u00f6pffer's other work, notably his hilarious travel tales, and recounts their curious genesis (with an initial imprimatur from Goethe, no less) and their controversial success. Kunzle's study, the first in English on the writer-artist, accompanies Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer: The Complete Comic Strips, a facsimile edition of the strips themselves, with the first-ever translation of these into English. David Kunzle is a professor of art history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of many books on popular culture and graphic arts, including History of the Comic Strip: The Nineteenth Century.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781578069477"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1578069475"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 207, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPt0GVZSsU4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPt0GVZSsU4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZPt0GVZSsU4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&cd=57&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZPt0GVZSsU4C&dq=Comic+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Father_of_the_Comic_Strip.html?hl=&id=ZPt0GVZSsU4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Father_of_the_Comic_Strip-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ZPt0GVZSsU4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZPt0GVZSsU4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A critical study of the Swiss artist who created the comic strip"}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vgGNFxy602kC", "etag": "0HmYVz19mzY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vgGNFxy602kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Meaning of Superhero Comic Books", "authors": ["Terrence R.

From Captain America punching Hitler in the jaw on his very first cover, to The Punisher surviving the battle of Firebase Valley Forge, there are countless instances when the military has crossed over to the pages of comic books. Soldiers and superheroes: A veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Jason Inman re-discovered his childhood love of comic books during long days at the Tallil Air Base in southern Iraq. He couldn\u2019t help but ask why so many comic books are filled with service members. Maybe it\u2019s their loyalty to everyday citizens and the never-ending quest for justice. The men and women who lace up their books and sacrifice their lives know that battle can change a person. What kinds of soldiers were these fictional characters, and how were they changed by war? Discover the super soldiers in Marvel comics, DC comics and beyond: Super Soldiers: A Salute to the Comic Book Heroes and Villains Who Fought for Their Country looks at the intersection between war and pop culture to understand these questions and more.

been misappropriated by governments, self-interest groups, do-gooders and sinister organisations to spread their messages. World War Two comic book propaganda with Superman, Batman, and Captain America bashing up cartoon enemies was so ubiquitous that there was barely a US comic untainted by the war effort. And theres no shortage of examples from the other side of the globe. This book examines every kind of propaganda, and how positive or pernicious messages have been conveyed in the pages of comic books over the last 100 years. Subject areas include racism and xenophobia, antidrugs comics, pro-drugs comics and religious comics. Plus, there is a look at social programming; how gender roles were re-enforced in comic book stereotyping, and how comics broke free to produce a whole slew of gay superheroes, no matter how ham-fistedly written. This book is a fascinating global, visual history of some of the most contentious, outrageous, unbelievably unusual and politically charged comics ever published.

together an international roster of scholars to examine many facets of comics and graphic novels. Contributor essays provide authoritative, up-to-date overviewsof the major topics and questions within comic studies, offering readers a truly global approach to understanding the field. Essays examine: the history of the temporal, geographical, and formal development of comics, including topics like art comics, manga, comix, and the comics code; issues such as authorship, ethics, adaptation, and translating comics; connections between comics and other artistic media (drawing, caricature, film) as well as the linkages between comics and other academic fields like linguistics and philosophy; new perspectives on comics genres, from funny animal comics to war comics to romance comics and beyond. The Routledge Companion to Comics expertly organizes representative work from a range of disciplines, including media and cultural studies, literature, philosophy, and linguistics. More than an introduction to the study of comics, this book will serve as a crucial reference for anyone interested in pursuing research in the area, guiding students, scholars, and comics fans
