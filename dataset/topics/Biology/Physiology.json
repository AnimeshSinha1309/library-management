Their work shows that when given a choice of natural foods, livestock have an astoundingly refined palate, nibbling through the day on as many as fifty kinds of grasses, forbs, and shrubs to meet their nutritional needs with remarkable precision. In Nourishment Provenza presents his thesis of the wisdom body, a wisdom that links flavor-feedback relationships at a cellular level with biochemically rich foods to meet the body's nutritional and medicinal needs. Provenza explores the fascinating complexity of these relationships as he raises and answers thought-provoking questions about what we can learn from animals about nutritional wisdom. What kinds of memories form the basis for how herbivores, and humans, recognize foods? Can a body develop nutritional and medicinal memories in utero and early in life? Do humans still possess the wisdom to select nourishing diets? Or, has that ability been hijacked by nutritional \"authorities\"? Consumers eager for a \"quick fix\" have empowered the multibillion-dollar-a-year supplement industry, but is taking supplements and enriching and fortifying foods helping us, or is it hurting us? On a broader scale Provenza explores the relationships among facets of complex, poorly understood, ever-changing ecological, social, and economic systems in light of an unpredictable future. To what degree do we lose contact with life-sustaining energies when the foods we eat come from anywhere but where we live? To what degree do we lose the mythological relationship that links us physically and spiritually with Mother Earth who nurtures our lives? Provenza's paradigm-changing exploration of these questions has implications that could vastly improve our health through a simple change in the way we view our relationships with the plants and animals we eat. Our health could be improved by eating biochemically rich foods and by creating cultures that know how to combine foods into meals that nourish and satiate. Provenza contends the voices of \"authority\" disconnect most people from a personal search to discover the inner wisdom that can nourish body and spirit. That journey means embracing wonder and uncertainty and avoiding illusions of stability and control as we dine on a planet in a universe bent on consuming itself.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603588027"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603588027"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Nourishment.html?hl=&id=KM50DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "U6lFCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "sM/zHbEYaiI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/U6lFCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cerebral oxygenation in health and disease", "subtitle": "", "authors": ["Patrice Brassard", "Phil Neil Ainslie", "Niels H Secher"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "publishedDate": "2015-03-26", "description": "Scientists and clinicians interested in cerebrovascular physiology in humans now have numerous possibilities to monitor, invasively or non-invasively, the oxygenation status of cerebral tissue.

G protein\u2013 coupled receptors (GPCRs), including \u00df-adrenergic receptors, constitute the most ubiquitous superfamily of plasma membrane receptors and represent the single most important type of therapeutic drug target. Sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, which characterizes several cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and hypertension, as well as physiological ageing, has been proved to exert in the long-term detrimental effects in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. Acutely, sympathetic hyperactivity represents the response to an insult to the myocardium, aiming to compensate for decreased cardiac output. This process involves the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors by catecholamine with consequent heart rate and cardiac contractility increase. However, long-term exposure of the heart to elevated norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, originating from sympathetic nerve endings and chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland, results in further progressive deterioration in cardiac structure and function. At the molecular level, sustained sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity is responsible for several alterations including altered beta-adrenergic receptor signaling and function (down-regulation/ desensitization). Moreover, the detrimental effects of catecholamine affect also the function of different cell types including, but not limited to, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Thus, the success of beta-blocker therapy is due, at least in part, to the protection of the heart and the vasculature from the noxious effects of augmented catecholamine levels. The research topic aimed to support the progress towards understanding the role of sympathetic nervous system under physiological conditions, and the contribution of its hyperactivity in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular diseases.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889197316"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "288919731X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Adrenergic_System_in_Cardiovascular.html?hl=&id=45mxDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Yv6syPooywoC", "etag": "JZfOVYMnDqU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Yv6syPooywoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Principles of Animal Design", "subtitle": "The Optimization and Symmorphosis Debate", "authors": ["Ewald R.

HRV describes changes in heartbeat intervals, which are caused by autonomic neural regulation, i.e. by the interplay of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The most frequent application of HRV is connected to cardiological issues, most importantly to the monitoring of post-myocardial infarction patients and the prediction of sudden cardiac death. Analysis of HRV is also frequently applied in relation to diabetes, renal failure, neurological and psychiatric conditions, sleep disorders, psychological phenomena such as stress, as well as drug and addiction research including alcohol and smoking. The widespread application of HRV measurements is based on the fact that they are noninvasive, easy to perform, and in general reproducible \u2013 if carried out under standardized conditions. However, the amount of parameters to be analysed is still rising. Well-established time domain and frequency domain parameters are discussed controversially when it comes to their physiological interpretation and their psychometric properties like reliability and validity, and the sensitivity to cardiovascular properties of the variety of parameters seems to be a topic for further research. Recently introduced parameters like pNNxx and new dynamic methods such as approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis offer new potentials and warrant standardization. However, HRV is significantly associated with average heart rate (HR) and one can conclude that HRV actually provides information on two quantities, i.e. on HR and its variability. It is hard to determine which of these two plays a principal role in the clinical value of HRV. The association between HRV and HR is not only a physiological phenomenon but also a mathematical one which is due to non-linear (mathematical) relationship between RR interval and HR. If one normalizes HRV to its average RR interval, one may get \u2018pure\u2019 variability free from the mathematical bias. Recently, a new modification method of the association between HRV and HR has been developed which enables us to completely remove the HRV dependence on HR (even the physiological one), or conversely enhance this dependence. Such an approach allows us to explore the HR contribution to the clinical significance of HRV, i.e. whether HR or its variability plays a main role in the HRV clinical value. This Research Topic covers recent advances in the application of HRV, methodological issues, basic underlying mechanisms as well as all aspects of the interaction between HRV and HR.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889196524"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889196526"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VqEgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VqEgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VqEgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VqEgCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Heart_Rate_Variability_Clinical_Applicat.html?hl=&id=VqEgCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VqEgCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "e37mCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "kFkPV6Rlegc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/e37mCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Vital Circuits", "subtitle": "On Pumps, Pipes, and the Workings of Circulatory Systems", "authors": ["Steven Vogel", "Rosemary Anne Calvert"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press on Demand", "publishedDate": "1993", "description": "This book is a fascinating, often witty, and highly original guide to the heart, vessels and blood, with side trips into the neighboring fields of physics, fluid mechanics, and chemistry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780195082692"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0195082699"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 315, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e37mCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e37mCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=e37mCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=e37mCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Vital_Circuits.html?hl=&id=e37mCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=e37mCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "3brfyOghHJcC", "etag": "9lbK9G3NkYk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/3brfyOghHJcC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How the Brain Got Language", "subtitle": "The Mirror System Hypothesis", "authors": ["Michael A.

Regardless this essential function, the CB has been implicated in the sensing of other physiological signals such as changes in blood flow and glucose levels. More important, malfunction of the CB chemoreceptors has been associated with the progression and deterioration of several disease states such as hypertension, heart failure, renal failure, insulin resistance, diabetes and sleep apnea. Although the mechanisms involved in the alterations of the CB function in pathophysiology are currently under intense research, the development of therapeutic approaches to restore normal CB chemoreflex function remains unsolved. Recent studies showing the effect of CB denervation in pathophysiology have unveiled a key role of these arterial chemoreceptors in the development of autonomic imbalance and respiratory disturbances, and suggest that targeting the CB could represent a novel strategy to improve disease outcome. Unfortunately, classical pharmacotherapy intended to normalize CB function may be hard to establish since several cellular pathways are involved in the CB dysfunction. Augmented levels of angiotensin II, endothelin-1, cytokines and free radicals along with decreases in nitric oxide had all been related to the CB dysfunction. Moreover, changes in expression of angiotensin receptors, nitric oxide synthases and cytokines that take place within the CB tissue in pathological states also contribute to the enhanced CB chemoreflex drive. It has been shown in heart failure, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea that the CB becomes tonically hyper-reactive. During the progression of the disease this CB chemosensory facilitation process induces central nervous system plasticity. The altered autonomic-respiratory control leads to increased cardiorespiratory distress and the deterioration of the condition. The focus of this e-book will be to cover the role of the CB in pathophysiology and to provide new evidence of the pathways involved in the maladaptive potentiation of the CB chemoreflex function.

Most patients are worried about resuming oral intake, particularly when the surgery has altered the GI tract normal physiology removing organs (e.g. total colectomy) or part of them, or modifying the natural sequence of the different GI tract parts (e.g. after esophagectomy or pancreatectomy). Patients may also worry about the possible complications of an inappropriate alimentation. As a matter of fact, several metabolic processes can be modified by GI tract surgery (e.g. major liver resection or pancreatectomy), thus making the nutritional support essential: and the same support is fundamental in bariatric surgery, nowadays widely used for super-obese patients. There is therefore a need for a nutritional guide in surgery and in troubleshooting postoperative cases where nutrition is a major issue This book offers nutritionists insights into the possible alterations of GI tract physiology occurring after surgery, and will be a valuable resource for surgeons, gastroenterologists, coloproctologists, nutritionists and clinical specialist nurses, seeking guidance on postoperative nutrition.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030165543"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "303016554X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 148, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7139, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7139, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XAGfDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7139000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7139000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nutritional_Support_after_Gastrointestin-sample-epub.acsm?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nutritional_Support_after_Gastrointestin-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oR8hpcQwc2QC", "etag": "HvLVXHYuCfE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oR8hpcQwc2QC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Physiology Or Medicine", "subtitle": "1981-1990", "authors": ["Tore Fr\u0084ngsmyr", "Jan E.

Here we discover how the turtle\u2019s proverbial slowness helps it survive a long, cold winter under ice. How the shell not only serves as a protective home but also influences such essential functions as buoyancy control, breathing, and surviving remarkably long periods without oxygen, and how many other physiological features help define this unique animal.

Nature has shaped echolocation, an active sense that engages audiomotor feedback systems, which operates in diverse environments and situations. Echolocation production and perception vary across species, and signals are often adapted to the environment and task. In the last several decades, researchers have been studying the echolocation behavior of animals, both in the air and underwater, using different methodologies and perspectives. The result of these studies has led to rich knowledge on sound production mechanisms, directionality of the sound beam, signal design, echo reception and perception. Active control over echolocation signal production and the mechanisms for echo processing ultimately provide animals with an echoic scene or image of their surroundings. Sonar signal features directly influence the information available for the echolocating animal to perceive images of its environment. In many echolocating animals, the information processed through echoes elicits a reaction in motor systems, including adjustments in subsequent echolocation signals. We are interested in understanding how echolocating animals deal with different environments (e.g. clutter, light levels), tasks, distance to targets or objects, different prey types or other food sources, presence of conspecifics or certain predators, ambient and anthropogenic noise. In recent years, some researchers have presented new data on the origins of echolocation, which can provide a hint of its evolution. Theoreticians have addressed several issues that bear on echolocation systems, such as frequency or time resolution, target localization and beam-forming mechanisms.

Other emergent areas of 1a,25(OH)2D3 action are in the control of immune functions, cellular growth and differentiation. This fits both with the widespread expression of the VDR and the above described consequences of vitamin D deficiency. Transcriptome-wide analysis indicated that per cell type between 200 and 600 genes are primary targets of vitamin D. Since most of these genes respond to vitamin D in a cell-specific fashion, the total number of vitamin D targets in the human genome is far higher than 1,000. This is supported by the genome-wide view on VDR binding sites in human lymphocytes, monocytes, colon and hepatic cells. All genomic actions of 1a,25(OH)2D3 are mediated by the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) that has been the subject of intense study since the 1980\u2019s. Thus, vitamin D signaling primarily implies the molecular actions of the VDR. In this research topic, we present in 15 chapters different perspectives on the action of vitamin D and its receptor, such as the impact of the genomewide distribution of VDR binding loci, ii) the transcriptome- and proteome-wide effects of vitamin D, iii) the role of vitamin D in health, iv) tissue-specific functions of vitamin D and v) the involvement of vitamin D in different diseases, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, diabetes and different types of cancer.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889193493"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889193497"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Genome_wide_view_on_the_physiology_of_vi.html?hl=&id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "uNtoDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "4mCpDELsSgg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/uNtoDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Nonlinear Dynamics in Physiology", "subtitle": "A State-space Approach", "authors": ["Mark Shelhamer"], "publisher": "World Scientific", "publishedDate": "2007", "description": "This book provides a compilation of mathematical-computational tools that are used to analyze experimental data.

Thus, the material will be useful to life-science investigators on several levels, from physiologists to bioengineer.Initial chapters present background material on dynamic systems, statistics, and linear system analysis. Each computational technique is demonstrated with examples drawn from physiology, and several chapters present case studies from oculomotor control, neuroscience, cardiology, psychology, and epidemiology.

Ostojic"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "publishedDate": "2016-05-25", "description": "Physiological responses after maximal and submaximal exercise are routinely monitored in a plethora of diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, asthma, neuromuscular disorders), and normal populations (e.g. athletes, youth, elderly), while slower or irregular post-exercise recovery usually indicates poor health and/or low fitness level. Abnormal post-exercise recovery (as assessed via blunted post-exercise heart rate dynamics) helps to predict the presence and severity of coronary artery disease, while differences in recovery outcomes in athletes might discriminate between fit and unfit individuals. Disturbances in post-exercise recovery might be due to acute or persistent changes in: (1) adaptive responses mediated by the autonomic nervous system and vasodilator substances, (2) cellular bioenergetics, and/or (3) muscular plasticity. Preliminary evidence suggests possible role of time-dependent modulation of nitric oxide synthase and adenosine receptors during post-exercise recovery, yet no molecular attributes of post-exercise recovery are revealed so far. Currently several markers of post-exercise recovery are used (e.g. heart rate measures, hormone profiles, biochemical and hematological indices); however none of them meets all criteria to make its use generally accepted as the gold standard. In addition, recent studies suggest that different pharmacological agents and dietary interventions, or manipulative actions (e.g. massage, cold-water immersion, compression garments, athletic training) administered before, during or immediately after exercise could positively affect post-exercise recovery. There is a growing interest to provide more evidence-based data concerning the effectiveness and safety of traditional and novel interventions to affect post-exercise recovery. The goals of this research topic are to critically evaluate the current advances on mechanisms and clinical implications of post-exercise recovery, and to summarize recent experimental data from interventional studies. This knowledge may help to identify the hierarchy of key mechanisms, and recognize methods to monitor and improve post-exercise recovery in both health and disease.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889198559"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889198553"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Post_Exercise_Recovery_Fundamental_and_I.html?hl=&id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0MdTBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "XsVAOmqdurg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0MdTBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Nikolai Bernstein - from Reflex to the Model of the Future", "subtitle": "From Reflexes to the Model of the Future", "authors": ["Josef M.

For example, significant changes of cardiovascular control and reactivity have been highlighted as important mechanisms for the protective effect of exercise as a simple and effective, non medical therapy for many pathologies. However, despite the great number of studies performed to date (e.g. >54,000 entries in Pubmed for \u201ccardiovascular stress\u201d), important questions of the role stress has on cardiovascular function still remain. For instance, What factors account for the different cardiovascular responses between mental and physical stressors? How do these different components of the cardiovascular system interact during stress? Which cardiovascular responses to stress are the most important for identifying normal, depressed, and enhanced cardiovascular function? Can these stress-induced responses assist with patient diagnosis and prognosis? What impact does physical fitness have on the relationship between cardiovascular function and health? The current topic examined our current understanding of cardiovascular responses to stress and the significant role that physical fitness has on these responses for improved function and health.
