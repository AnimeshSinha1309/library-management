And every mother wants her daughters to be happily married. Mr and Mrs Bennet of Longbourn House, in the village of Longbourn, had five unmarried daughters. So when Mrs Bennet heard that a young man was coming to live in the neighbourhood, she was delighted'. She found out all she could about him, and hurried to tell her husband the good news.'Oh, Mr Bennet, Netherfield Hall is let at last!' Mrs Bennet cried excitedly. 'Don't you want to know who is going to live there?'No,' Mr Bennet answered, 'but I am sure you want to tell me.' 'The house is let to a young man from the north of England. His name is Bingley, he's very rich and not married. What a chance this is for our dear Jane! Everyone knows she's the most beautiful girl in Hertfordshire. She's so good-natured too. She will be an excellent wife for Mr Bingley.'I shall be very happy to have her living so near us. And in a fine house like Netherfield too! Mr Bingley plans to live there with his sister. She and Jane''Please stop a moment, Mrs Bennet,' her husband said quietly. Why are you telling me all this? Mr Bingley is a stranger. But you are saying that he has come here to marry one of our daughters!''I did not say that,' Mrs Bennet answered. 'But we must think of our daughters' future. You must call on Mr Bingley at once, Mr Bennet.''I don't think so, my dear,' Mr Bennet said calmly. 'But I'll write to this young man and give him my permission to marry Jane or whoever he chooses. Perhaps he'd like to marry my little Lizzy.''Don't tease me, please, Mr Bennet,' Mrs Bennet replied. 'I know Lizzy is your favourite daughter, but she is not as beautiful as Jane, nor as lively as Lydia.''Our girls are silly and thoughtless,' Mr Bennet said severely. 'But Lizzy is a little more sensible than the others.'Mr and Mrs Bennet were not happily married. After twenty-three years, Mr Bennet was tired of his wife's chatter and love of gossip. And Mrs Bennet had never understood her husband's sense of humour.A few days later, Mr Bennet called on Mr Bingley, without telling Mrs Bennet. She was delighted when she found out that Mr Bennet had called at Netherfield Hall.'Girls, you have such a good father!' Mrs Bennet cried. 'You will thank him for calling at Netherfield, Jane, when you are married to Mr Bingley.'You must look very beautiful at the next assembly ball, my dear,' Mrs Bennet went on, 'I'm sure that Mr Bingley will be there.'On the following Friday, the assembly rooms in the town of Meryton were crowded. Everyone stared as Mr Bingley came in with two ladies and two gentlemen.The fashionably dressed young woman with Mr Bingley was his unmarried sister, Miss Caroline Bingley. Mr Bingley's married sister, Louisa Hurst, was also there, with her husband. The other gentleman was Mr Bingley's friend, Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.Mr Bingley was a good-looking young man with a pleasant smile. Mr Darcy was tall, very handsome and from a noble family. People said he had twice as much money as Mr Bingley and a large estate in Derbyshire. He was also unmarried.At first, everyone admired Mr Darcy. But he danced only with Bingley's sisters and spoke to no one else. Mrs Bennet and her friends soon agreed that, although Mr Darcy was a fine gentleman, he was much too proud.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=q-b9sgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Beautiful Disaster Signed Limited Edition", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["Jamie McGuire"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 432, "ratingsCount": 1, "averageRating": 5, "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2012-11-27", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2dKp8VsPm30C&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:Beautiful+Disaster&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dKp8VsPm30C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "Travis Maddox, Eastern University's playboy, makes a bet with good girl Abby that if he loses, he will remain abstinent for a month, but if he wins, Abby must live in his apartment for the same amount of time.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2dKp8VsPm30C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Twilight", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["Kristen Heitzmann"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 352, "ratingsCount": 10, "averageRating": 4, "publisher": "Bethany House", "publishedDate": "2002-07-01", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=R35zBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA197&dq=name:Twilight&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R35zBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "A powerful contemporary novel that reunites two former high school sweethearts.

Gone with the Wind is often placed in the literary subgenre of the historical romance novel. The epic romance tale set in and around Atlanta, Georgia during the American Civil War has remained a bestseller, even before the equally popular film starring Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh was made in 1939. The novel has also been described as an early classic of the erotic historical genre, because it is thought to contain some degree of pornography. The novel tells of archetypal Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara as she grows from a young woman into maturity against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Like many of the early 20th century Southern writers, Mitchell portrays an idyllic image of the antebellum South. While it can be legitimately criticized for its insensitivity to the treatment of African Americans who were enslaved, Mitchell's novel demonstrates how the South was decimated by the Civil War and continued to suffer under the Northern-sanctioned Restoration.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2ubIDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Gabriel's Inferno", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["Sylvain Reynard"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 560, "ratingsCount": 67, "averageRating": 3.5, "publisher": "Penguin Group Australia", "publishedDate": "2012-08-23", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Rzg-o0kEFnAC&dq=name:Gabriel%27s+Inferno&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rzg-o0kEFnAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "From bestselling author Sylvain Reynard comes the haunting, unforgettable tale of one man's salvation and one woman's sensual awakening . . .

When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder -- much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing -- not even a smear of blood -- to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy? This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...

Part I addresses the question, What does it take for a teacher of writing to develop an identity as writer? Using case studies and teacher narratives, it guides readers to an understanding of the current status of writing as the 21st century unfolds, the role of expressive writing in developing a writing identity, the relationship of writing to genre and rhetoric, writing and professional identity, and writing as design. Part II focuses on pedagogical practice and helping writer-teachers develop a toolkit to take into their classrooms. Coverage includes building a community of writing practice; the nature of writing as process; the place of grammar; the role of information, communication and representational technologies; and how assessment, properly used, can help develop writing.

But things aren't so great at home and Bianca, desperate for a distraction, ends up kissing Wesley. Worse, she likes it.

The Third Coming will take place when Christ, the son of David comes down on the Mount of Olives to rule the earth for a millennium. The Second Coming is on. The author Bro. Deva Evu Lawrie had had an experience of peace with God early in life at the age of eight. He had been a keen observer in the ministry of his father. He was a student of the famous Madras Christian College, Tambaram, Chennai. He became a full-time minister of religion when he was eighteen. He had been working with his dad since then. There was a great turning point when his dad, Bro. Paulaseer Lawrie, was preaching at Chicago, USA. He had a great experience of God coming down into him when man first landed on the moon on July 20, 1969. The sky opened, and he could see and feel a great and terrific power enter into his life (Luke 3: 2122). In these pages, Bro. Deva Evu Lawrie, the author, shows that most of the prophecies and things concerning the Second Coming have been fulfilled in the ministry of Bro. Paulaseer Lawrie of India. He cites mostly from the Holy Scriptures. He wants the readers to go through the book carefully so that they do not miss the glory that God had foreordained for us in this generation.

Since empowerment is a very vital act of mentorship that fosters self-identity and ameliorates an individuals quality of life, ignorance is bliss only when the knowledge of God is not involved. Its through our relationship with God that we come to find our purpose, gain confidence, become courageous and suppress our fears in life as we progress towards our destiny. As we seek to find our God mandated purpose in our lives, its very imperative to know that life comes in phases where victory of your present stage invigorates your progress in the next stage. Nevertheless, our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. Its our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Most of the times we ask ourselves; who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and successful? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your constrained thinking does not serve or impact the world. Your life is not a mistake. Every human being has a purpose which should dictate him or her to live a purpose driven life. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. Its not just in some of us; its in everyone. As we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to follow suit.

Now exiled from his angelic brethren, he reluctantly joins the Chicago league of talyan-immortal warriors possessed by repentant demons-as his only chance to reclaim his sword and his place in the holy sphericanum. Bella McGreay, mysterious mistress of the Mortal Coil night club, has also danced around an uneasy affiliation with the talyan. She has secrets of her own to keep, and as the days shorten toward the winter solstice, shadows are deepening all around. Even as she barricades herself against the joys-and terrors-of the Christmas season, she'll have to decide whether the shadows or her secrets are more dangerous. Bella and Cyril have good reason to fear evil when an old enemy returns to torment them and the Chicago league. Only together will they find a way to the light after the darkest night. \"Praise for the Marked Souls novels\" \"DARK AND SEXY AND INTENSE.\" New York Times Bestselling Author Nalini Singh \"WONDERFULLY ADDICTIVE!\" New York Times Bestselling Author Gena Showalter \"A CHILLING, COMPLEX, AND UTTERLY BELIEVABLE WORLD.\" Award-winning Author Jeri Smith Ready \"[A] RICH CROSSOVER URBAN FANTASY.\" Publishers Weekly", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9tRXqCp3MtoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Lock and Key", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "authors": ["Sarah Dessen"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 448, "ratingsCount": 112, "averageRating": 4, "publisher": "Penguin UK", "publishedDate": "2009-04-02", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A-YOchFFmHkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:Lock+and+Key&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A-YOchFFmHkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "Ruby Cooper likes to expect the worst.
