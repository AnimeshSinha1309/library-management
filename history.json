It also illustrates how two displays of American naval and munitions power had an impact on Japan comparable to the September 11, 2001 assaults on America. Linking his study with two contemporary films on Iwo Jima, the author illustrates how the 1940s were an era of costly triumph that can still inspire national pride in American citizens.

The architect was Daniel H. Burnham, the driving force behind the White City, the massive, visionary landscape of white buildings set in a wonderland of canals and gardens. The killer was H. H. Holmes, a handsome doctor with striking blue eyes. He used the attraction of the great fair - and his own devilish charms - to lure scores of young women to their deaths. While Burnham overcame politics, infighting, personality clashes and Chicago's infamous weather to transform the swamps of Jackson Park into the greatest show on Earth, Holmes built his own edifice just west of the fairground. He called it the World's Fair Hotel. In reality it was a torture palace, a gas chamber, a crematorium.

James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory. The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This \"new birth of freedom,\" as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict. This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing \"second American Revolution\" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "A Short History of Nearly Everything", "categories": ["Science"], "authors": ["Bill Bryson"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 672, "ratingsCount": 3469, "averageRating": 4, "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2010-03-02", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:A+Short+History+of+Nearly+Everything&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "Bill Bryson describes himself as a reluctant traveller, but even when he stays safely at home he can't contain his curiosity about the world around him.

In the early decades of the 20th century, German artists, writers, philosophers, scientists, and engineers were leading their freshly-unified country to new and undreamed of heights, and by 1933, they had won more Nobel prizes than anyone else and more than the British and Americans combined. But this genius was cut down in its prime with the rise and subsequent fall of Adolf Hitler and his fascist Third Reich-a legacy of evil that has overshadowed the nation's contributions ever since. Yet how did the Germans achieve their pre-eminence beginning in the mid-18th century? In this fascinating cultural history, Peter Watson goes back through time to explore the origins of the German genius, how it flourished and shaped our lives, and, most importantly, to reveal how it continues to shape our world. As he convincingly demonstarates, while we may hold other European cultures in higher esteem, it was German thinking-from Bach to Nietzsche to Freud-that actually shaped modern America and Britain in ways that resonate today.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nvUY0YwuKF0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Changing Name of Mount Rainier", "categories": ["Rainier, Mount (Wash.)"], "authors": ["United States.

From Antony Beevor, the internationally bestselling author of D-Day and The Battle of Arnhem. In August 1942, Hitler's huge Sixth Army reached the city that bore Stalin's name. In the five-month siege that followed, the Russians fought to hold Stalingrad at any cost; then, in an astonishing reversal, encircled and trapped their Nazi enemy. This battle for the ruins of a city cost more than a million lives. Stalingrad conveys the experience of soldiers on both sides, fighting in inhuman conditions, and of civilians trapped on an urban battlefield. Antony Beevor has itnerviewed survivors and discovered completely new material in a wide range of German and Soviet archives, including prisoner interrogations and reports of desertions and executions.

At the height of its power, it stretched over three continents and produced marvels of architecture, literature, science, and warfare.

The Japanese army swept into the ancient city of Nanking (what was then the capital of China), and within weeks, more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and soldiers were systematically raped, tortured, and murdered. In this seminal work, Iris Chang, whose own grandparents barely escaped the massacre, tells this history from three perspectives: that of the Japanese soldiers, that of the Chinese, and that of a group of Westerners who refused to abandon the city and created a safety zone, which saved almost 300,000 Chinese.

It offers a scintillating view of those dramatic and fateful days when much of the modern world was sketched out, when countries were created\u2014Iraq, Yugoslavia, Israel\u2014whose troubles haunt us still. Winner of the Samuel Johnson Prize \u2022 Winner of the PEN Hessell Tiltman Prize \u2022 Winner of the Duff Cooper Prize Between January and July 1919, after \u201cthe war to end all wars,\u201d men and women from around the world converged on Paris to shape the peace. Center stage, for the first time in history, was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who with his Fourteen Points seemed to promise to so many people the fulfillment of their dreams. Stern, intransigent, impatient when it came to security concerns and wildly idealistic in his dream of a League of Nations that would resolve all future conflict peacefully, Wilson is only one of the larger-than-life characters who fill the pages of this extraordinary book. David Lloyd George, the gregarious and wily British prime minister, brought Winston Churchill and John Maynard Keynes. Lawrence of Arabia joined the Arab delegation. Ho Chi Minh, a kitchen assistant at the Ritz, submitted a petition for an independent Vietnam. For six months, Paris was effectively the center of the world as the peacemakers carved up bankrupt empires and created new countries. This book brings to life the personalities, ideals, and prejudices of the men who shaped the settlement. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China, and dismissed the Arabs. They struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews. The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; above all they failed to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made the scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. She refutes received ideas about the path from Versailles to World War II and debunks the widely accepted notion that reparations imposed on the Germans were in large part responsible for the Second World War.

An act of terrorism of staggering efficiency, it fulfilled its every aim: it would liberate Bosnia from Habsburg rule and it created a powerful new Serbia, but it also brought down four great empires, killed millions of men and destroyed a civilization. What made a seemingly prosperous and complacent Europe so vulnerable to the impact of this assassination?

His legend as the Great Emancipator has grown to mythic proportions as hundreds of books, a national holiday, and a monument in Washington, D.C., extol his heroism and martyrdom. But what if most everything you knew about Lincoln were false? What if, instead of an American hero who sought to free the slaves, Lincoln were in fact a calculating politician who waged the bloodiest war in american history in order to build an empire that rivaled Great Britain's? In The Real Lincoln, author Thomas J. DiLorenzo uncovers a side of Lincoln not told in many history books--and overshadowed by the immense Lincoln legend. Through extensive research and meticulous documentation, DiLorenzo portrays the sixteenth president as a man who devoted his political career to revolutionizing the American form of government from one that was very limited in scope and highly decentralized\u2014as the Founding Fathers intended\u2014to a highly centralized, activist state. Standing in his way, however, was the South, with its independent states, its resistance to the national government, and its reliance on unfettered free trade. To accomplish his goals, Lincoln subverted the Constitution, trampled states' rights, and launched a devastating Civil War, whose wounds haunt us still. According to this provacative book, 600,000 American soldiers did not die for the honorable cause of ending slavery but for the dubious agenda of sacrificing the independence of the states to the supremacy of the federal government, which has been tightening its vise grip on our republic to this very day. In The Real Lincoln, you will discover a side of Lincoln that you were probably never taught in school\u2014a side that calls into question the very myths that surround him and helps explain the true origins of a bloody, and perhaps, unnecessary war.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5B9qs5dAnuwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Endurance", "categories": ["History"], "authors": ["Alfred Lansing"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 416, "ratingsCount": 62, "averageRating": 4.5, "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=R1o4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:Endurance:+Shackleton%27s+Incredible+Voyage&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R1o4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "Discover one of the greatest adventure stories of the modern age: the harrowing tale of British explorer Ernest Shackleton's 1914 attempt to reach the South Pole.

Three months later she became sole empress of the largest empire on earth. She was 33 years old. She ruled Russia as a benevolent autocrat for 34 years,fighting the Turks abroad and rebellion at home, and shepherding her people through the upheavals of the French Revolution.

Empire of the Summer Moon spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second is the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled backward by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. Against this backdrop Gwynne presents the compelling drama of Cynthia Ann Parker, a nine-year-old girl who was kidnapped by Comanches in 1836. She grew to love her captors and became infamous as the \"White Squaw\" who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860. More famous still was her son Quanah, a warrior who was never defeated and whose guerrilla wars in the Texas Panhandle made him a legend. S. C. Gwynne's account of these events is meticulously researched, intellectually provocative, and, above all, thrillingly told.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mLSeBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Seven Years in Tibet", "categories": ["Travel"], "authors": ["Heinrich Harrer"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 336, "ratingsCount": 9, "averageRating": 3.5, "publisher": "HarperCollins UK", "publishedDate": "2010-06-24", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0UbQ_UOZrMYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:Seven+Years+in+Tibet&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0UbQ_UOZrMYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "A landmark in travel writing, this is the incredible true story of Heinrich Harrer\u2019s escape across the Himalayas to Tibet, set against the backdrop of the Second World War.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0UbQ_UOZrMYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Manhunt", "categories": ["Assassination"], "authors": ["James L.

Relatively few records have been found regarding Hamilton\u2019s birth, childhood, and origins in the West Indies. Alexander Hamilton \u201crarely . . . dwelt upon his personal history\u201d and never recorded his life\u2019s story. Most of Hamilton\u2019s correspondence prior to 1777 was lost during the American Revolution. This has resulted in many gaps in Alexander Hamilton\u2019s biography, which has given rise to much conjecture regarding the details of his life. Relying on new research and extensive analysis of the existing literature, Michael E. Newton presents a more comprehensive and accurate account of Alexander Hamilton\u2019s formative years. Despite being orphaned as a young boy and having his birth be \u201cthe subject of the most humiliating criticism,\u201d Alexander Hamilton used his intelligence, determination, and charisma to overcome his questionable origins and desperate situation. As a mere child, Hamilton went to work for a West Indian mercantile company. Within a few short years, Hamilton was managing the firm\u2019s St. Croix operations. Gaining the attention of the island\u2019s leading men, Hamilton was sent to mainland North America for an education, where he immediately fell in with the country\u2019s leading patriots. After using his pen to defend the civil liberties of the Americans against British infringements, Hamilton took up arms in the defense of those rights. Earning distinction in the campaign of 1776\u201377 at the head of an artillery company, Hamilton attracted the attention of General George Washington, who made him his aide-de-camp. Alexander Hamilton was soon writing some of Washington\u2019s most important correspondence, advising the commander-in-chief on crucial military and political matters, carrying out urgent missions, conferring with French allies, negotiating with the British, and helping Washington manage his spy network. As Washington later attested, Hamilton had become his \u201cprincipal and most confidential aid.\u201d After serving the commander-in-chief for four years, Hamilton was given a field command and led the assault on Redoubt Ten at Yorktown, the critical engagement in the decisive battle of the War for Independence. By the age of just twenty-five, Alexander Hamilton had proven himself to be one of the most intelligent, brave, hard-working, and patriotic Americans. Alexander Hamilton: The Formative Years tells the dramatic story of how this poor immigrant emerged from obscurity and transformed himself into the most remarkable Founding Father. In riveting detail, Michael E. Newton delivers a fresh and fascinating account of Alexander Hamilton\u2019s origins, youth, and indispensable services during the American Revolution.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9GvpCQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Citizen Soldiers", "categories": ["History"], "authors": ["Stephen E.

Sledge\u2019s acclaimed first-person account of fighting at Peleliu and Okinawa returns to thrill, edify, and inspire a new generation. An Alabama boy steeped in American history and enamored of such heroes as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene B. Sledge became part of the war\u2019s famous 1st Marine Division\u20143rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Even after intense training, he was shocked to be thrown into the battle of Peleliu, where \u201cthe world was a nightmare of flashes, explosions, and snapping bullets.\u201d By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic.

What began as a small community of peasants camped among marshes and hills ended up ruling the known world. Rubicon paints a vivid portrait of the Republic at the climax of its greatness - the same greatness which would herald the catastrophe of its fall. It is a story of incomparable drama. This was the century of Julius Caesar, the gambler whose addiction to glory led him to the banks of the Rubicon, and beyond; of Cicero, whose defence of freedom would make him a byword for eloquence; of Spartacus, the slave who dared to challenge a superpower; of Cleopatra, the queen who did the same. Tom Holland brings to life this strange and unsettling civilization, with its extremes of ambition and self-sacrifice, bloodshed and desire. Yet alien as it was, the Republic still holds up a mirror to us. Its citizens were obsessed by celebrity chefs, all-night dancing and exotic pets; they fought elections in law courts and were addicted to spin; they toppled foreign tyrants in the name of self-defence.

From the turn-of-the-century discovery of nuclear energy to the dropping of the first bombs on Japan, Richard Rhodes\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning book details the science, the people, and the socio-political realities that led to the development of the atomic bomb. This sweeping account begins in the 19th century, with the discovery of nuclear fission, and continues to World War Two and the Americans\u2019 race to beat Hitler\u2019s Nazis. That competition launched the Manhattan Project and the nearly overnight construction of a vast military-industrial complex that culminated in the fateful dropping of the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Reading like a character-driven suspense novel, the book introduces the players in this saga of physics, politics, and human psychology\u2014from FDR and Einstein to the visionary scientists who pioneered quantum theory and the application of thermonuclear fission, including Planck, Szilard, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, Meitner, von Neumann, and Lawrence. From nuclear power\u2019s earliest foreshadowing in the work of H.G.

Nikola Tesla invented the radio, robots, and remote control. His electric induction motors run our appliances and factories, yet he has been largely overlooked by history. In Tesla, Richard Munson presents a comprehensive portrait of this farsighted and underappreciated mastermind. When his first breakthrough\u2014alternating current, the basis of the electric grid\u2014pitted him against Thomas Edison\u2019s direct-current empire, Tesla\u2019s superior technology prevailed. Unfortunately, he had little business sense and could not capitalize on this success. His most advanced ideas went unrecognized for decades: forty years in the case of the radio patent, longer still for his ideas on laser beam technology. Although penniless during his later years, he never stopped imagining. In the early 1900s, he designed plans for cell phones, the Internet, death-ray weapons, and interstellar communications. His ideas have lived on to shape the modern economy. Who was this genius? Drawing on letters, technical notebooks, and other primary sources, Munson pieces together the magnificently bizarre personal life and mental habits of the enigmatic inventor. Born during a lightning storm at midnight, Tesla died alone in a New York City hotel. He was an acute germaphobe who never shook hands and required nine napkins when he sat down to dinner. Strikingly handsome and impeccably dressed, he spoke eight languages and could recite entire books from memory. Yet Tesla\u2019s most famous inventions were not the product of fastidiousness or linear thought but of a mind fueled by both the humanities and sciences: he conceived the induction motor while walking through a park and reciting Goethe\u2019s Faust. Tesla worked tirelessly to offer electric power to the world, to introduce automatons that would reduce life\u2019s drudgery, and to develop machines that might one day abolish war. His story is a reminder that technology can transcend the marketplace and that profit is not the only motivation for invention. This clear, authoritative, and highly readable biography takes account of all phases of Tesla\u2019s remarkable life.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gMQ6DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Salt", "categories": ["History"], "authors": ["Mark Kurlansky"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 496, "ratingsCount": 68, "averageRating": 3.5, "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2011-09-30", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YbT64n3wYhoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:Salt:+A+World+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YbT64n3wYhoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "Homer called it a divine substance.

He was a rebel and nonconformist from boyhood days. His character, creativity and imagination were related, and they drove both his life and his science. In this marvellously clear and accessible narrative, Walter Isaacson explains how his mind worked and the mysteries of the universe that he discovered. Einstein's success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marvelling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a worldview based on respect for free spirits and free individuals. All of which helped make Einstein into a rebel but with a reverence for the harmony of nature, one with just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to transform our understanding of the universe. This new biography, the first since all of Einstein's papers have become available, is the fullest picture yet of one of the key figures of the twentieth century.

One of the defining battles of the war, D-Day is scored into the imagination as the moment when the darkness of the Third Reich began to be swept away. This is the story of D-Day, told through the voices of over 1,000 survivors - from high-ranking Allied and German officers, to the paratroopers who landed in Normandy before dawn, the infantry who struggled ashore and the German troops who defended the coast.Cornelius Ryan captures the horror and the glory of D-Day, relating in emotive and compelling detail the years of inspired tactical planning that led up to the invasion, its epic implementation and every stroke of luck and individual act of heroism that would later define the battle.In the words of its author, The Longest Day is a story not of war, but of the courage of man.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fHMCwgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "His Excellency", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "authors": ["Joseph J.

Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator. Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and--after his murder--three more with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since. Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra's supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost.

The British Wars is a story of revolution and reaction, inspiration and disenchantment, of progress and catastrophe, and Schama's evocative narrative brings it vividly to life.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7kxBr71v3vAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "A People's Tragedy", "categories": ["Russia"], "authors": ["Orlando Figes"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 923, "ratingsCount": null, "averageRating": null, "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "1997", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ety5B4feoDoC&dq=name:A+People%27s+Tragedy:+The+Russian+Revolution:+1891-1924&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ety5B4feoDoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "Russia under the old regime - The crisis of authority - Russia in revolution (February 1917-March 1918) - The civil war and the making of the Soviet system (1918-24); Lenin - Marx - Stalin - Kerensky - Trotskysk_____________", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ety5B4feoDoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Eastern Europe!", "categories": ["History"], "authors": ["Tomek E.

When the legendary Romulus killed his brother Remus and founded the city of Rome in 753 BCE, Plovdiv -- today the second-largest city in Bulgaria -- was already thousands of years old. Indeed, London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Madrid, Brussels, Amsterdam are all are mere infants compared to Plovdiv. This is just one of the paradoxes that haunts and defines the New Europe, that part of Europe that was freed from Soviet bondage in 1989 which is at once both much older than the modern Atlantic-facing power centers of Western Europe while also being in some ways much younger than them. Even those knowledgeable about Western Europe often see Eastern Europe as terra incognita, with a sign on the border declaring \"Here be monsters.\" This book is a gateway to understanding both what unites and separates Eastern Europeans from their Western brethren, and how this vital region has been shaped by, but has also left its mark on, Western Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Ideal for students, businesspeople, and those who simply want to know more about where Grandma or Grandpa came from, Eastern Europe! is a user-friendly guide to a region that is all too often mischaracterized as remote, insular, and superstitious.

The Last Lion: Visions of Glory follows the first fifty-eight years of Churchill's life--the years that mold him into the man who will become one of the most influential politicians of the twentieth century. In this, the first volume, Manchester follows Churchill from his birth to 1932, when he began to warn against the re-militarization of Germany. Born of an American mother and the gifted but unstable son of a duke, his childhood was one of wretched neglect. He sought glory on the battlefields of Cuba, Sudan, India, South Africa and the trenches of France. In Parliament he was the prime force behind the creation of Iraq and Jordan, laid the groundwork for the birth of Israel, and negotiated the independence of the Irish Free State. Yet, as Chancellor of the Exchequer he plunged England into economic crisis, and his fruitless attempt to suppress Gandhi's quest for Indian independence brought political chaos to Britain. Throughout, Churchill learned the lessons that would prepare him for the storm to come, and as the 1930's began, he readied himself for the coming battle against Nazism--an evil the world had never before seen.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cOzN2Eb8UnEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Cicero", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "authors": ["Anthony Everitt"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 364, "ratingsCount": 19, "averageRating": 4, "publisher": "Random House Incorporated", "publishedDate": "2003", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EjiWacFZk68C&dq=name:Cicero:+The+Life+and+Times+of+Rome%27s+Greatest+Politician&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EjiWacFZk68C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "A lively portrait of the quintessential Roman politician describes the life and times of the ancient statesman, based on the witty and candid letters that Cicero wrote to his friend Atticus in which he described the events and personalities that shaped the final days of Republican Rome.

Combining royal biography, romance, and political assassination, the story unfolds against a backdrop of glittering privilege and an Imperial Court consumed with hatred, taking readers from Bohemian castles to the horrors of Nazi concentration camps in a compelling, fascinating human drama. As moving as the fabled romance of Nicholas and Alexandra, as dramatic as Mayerling, Sarajevo resonates with love and loss, triumph and tragedy in a vibrant and powerful narrative. It lays bare the lethal circumstances surrounding that fateful Sunday morning in 1914, examining not only the Serbian conspiracy that killed Franz and Sophie and sparked the First World War but also insinuations about the hidden powers in Vienna that may well have sent them to their deaths. With a Foreword from the Archduke's great-granddaughter, Princess Sophie von Hohenberg, and drawing on a wide variety of unpublished sources and with unique access to previously restricted Hungarian and Czech archives, including Sophie's diaries and family papers, King and Woolmans have written the most comprehensive account of this momentous event available in English. In doing so, they offer readers an intriguing and startlingly revisionist look at this most famous of Archdukes, his family, and their momentous collision with destiny in 1914.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jct6AAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "The Prize", "categories": ["Social Science"], "authors": ["Daniel Yergin"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 928, "ratingsCount": 13, "averageRating": 4.5, "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=C6pGQvVqNAoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:The+Prize:+The+Epic+Quest+for+Oil,+Money,+and+Power&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C6pGQvVqNAoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "The Prize recounts the panoramic history of oil -- and the struggle for wealth power that has always surrounded oil.

Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War.
