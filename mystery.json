Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case. It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the \"soul of pampered self-absorption\"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YjxITJFUDhoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "A Time To Kill", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["John Grisham"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 752, "ratingsCount": 79, "averageRating": 4, "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2010-04-21", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xp39K0c0IaEC&pg=PA546&dq=name:A+Time+to+Kill&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xp39K0c0IaEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "_______________________________________ THE MULTI-MILLION COPY BESTSELLER John Grisham's first and most shocking novel, adapted as a film starring Samuel L.

Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today.

Her discovery plunges her into a world she never dreamed of - a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an evil hidden in the depths of history. In those few quiet moments, she unwittingly assumes a quest she will discover is her birthright - a hunt for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the Dracula myth.

'Quite extraordinary....Kostova is a natural storyteller....She has refashioned the vampire myth into a compelling contemporary novel, a late-night page-turner' - San Francisco Chronicle 'Filled with fascinating details of archaic vampire lore, the splendours of the Ottoman Empire and the beauty of the Romanian countryside' - Times Literary Supplement", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dMixWjnhEZYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Crime and Punishment", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["Fyodor Dostoevsky"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 605, "ratingsCount": null, "averageRating": null, "publisher": "Read Books Ltd", "publishedDate": "2019-02-08", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bBl5CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=name:Crime+and+Punishment&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bBl5CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "\u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d is an 1866 novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. The narrative concerns the inner anguish of Rodion Raskolnikov, a poor ex-student in Saint Petersburg who conceives a murderous plan to steal from a notorious pawnbroker. However, after the deed is done he deteriorates into a feverish state and begins to fret obsessively. In his delirium, Rodion wanders the streets of the city unknowingly drawing attention to himself and his connection to the crime. A masterpiece that places you into the confused mind of a misguided murderer, Dostoevsky's \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d is a classic of Russian literature not to be missed by any lover of fiction. Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821 \u2013 1881) was a Russian novelist, essayist, short story writer, journalist, and philosopher. His literature examines human psychology during the turbulent social, spiritual and political atmosphere of 19th-century Russia, and he is considered one of the greatest psychologists in world literature. A prolific writer, Dostoevsky produced 11 novels, three novellas, 17 short stories and numerous other works. Many vintage books such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially-commissioned new biography of the author.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bBl5CgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "In the Name of Friendship: Deguy, Derrida and Salut", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "authors": null, "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 556, "ratingsCount": null, "averageRating": null, "publisher": "BRILL", "publishedDate": "2017-11-27", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WIJ1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&dq=name:The+Poet&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WIJ1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "In the Name of Friendship: Deguy, Derrida and Salut explores the friendship between poetry and philosophy in the works of Michel Deguy and Jacques Derrida, and the cultural, political and religious implications of the name understood as a secular form of sacredness.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WIJ1DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Feminismos.

While Burnham overcame politics, infighting, personality clashes and Chicago's infamous weather to transform the swamps of Jackson Park into the greatest show on Earth, Holmes built his own edifice just west of the fairground.

They murdered him for a 48,000$ life insurance with a double indemnity clause in it. Both of them also had an affair before they decided to murder Ruth's husband. Judd Gray was a corset salesman. Present to the trial was James M. Cain, at that time working as a reporter. Many believe that this case gave Cain the idea for one of his most famous novels, Double Indemnity. Several signs lead to that conclusion. First of all Ruth was unhappily married and began an affair with a salesman. Secondly her husband had already been married once, before he married Ruth, but his first wife died of pneumonia. Furthermore, the two of them had a daughter named Lorraine, who shares the same first two letters in her name with the Lola in Double Indemnity, daughter of Mr. and Ms. Nirdlinger. Moreover Ruth's husband was killed for the money of his life insurance, which contained a double indemnity clause. And last but not least they tried to disguise the murder as an accident, to collect on the double indemnity (see www.examiner.com). Many say that Double Indemnity was one of Cain's masterpieces, and it was made into a movie, which was named after the novel. It is even said, by some, to have heavily influenced the roman noir genre, as the movie is said to have had a great impact on the film noir genre (see Skenazy, 34/134; Marling, 263). The aim of this term paper is not to give an overview of what is roman, or film noir. It is just going to point out one specific feature of both of the genres, and will try to give an explanation what makes this feature so special. The feature spoken of is the point of view (or perspective, or focalisation). First, there will be the chapters two and three concerning the theoretical background of point of view in novels and screenplays. This will be done rather briefly and roughly, because this term paper is focused more on the effect of the point of view than the way it is structured. Chapters four and five then go into detail on the point of view in Double Indemnity, novel and screenplay. Over the course of these two chapters, two special effects will be highlighted, the 'Foreshadowing' and the way in which the reader's, or the audience's estimation of the characters is influenced. This is followed in the last chapter by a conclusion.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YZ08BNJEkIkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "The Postman Always Rings Twice", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["James M.

It nearly got him put away when he was younger, but his adopted brother took the rap for that. Now the sickness that has been lying dormant for a while is about to surface again - and the consequences are brutal and devastating.
