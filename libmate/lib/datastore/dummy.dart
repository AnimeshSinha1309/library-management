'There was something else out on the sea by the rocks - something dark that seemed to lurch out of the waves . . . What could it be?' Julian, Dick and Anne are spending the holidays with their tomboy cousin George and her dog, Timothy. One day, George takes them to explore nearby Kirrin Island, with its rocky little coast and old ruined castle on the top. Over on the island, they make a thrilling discovery, which leads them deep into the dungeons of Kirrin Castle on a dangerous adventure. Who - and what - will they find there? Fantastic new cover art by Laura Ellen Anderson will draw young readers into this accessible timeless classic.",

      "One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information remains the best textbook in this exciting field of science. This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.",

It Covers Geometry, Algebra And Trigonometry Plus A Little Of Combinatorics. Number Theory And Probability. It Is Written Specifically For The Top Half Whose Ambition Is To Excel And Rise To The Peak Without Finding The Journey A Forced Uphill Task.The Undercurrent Of The Book Is To Motivate The Student To Enjoy The Pleasures Of A Mathematical Pursuit And Of Problem Solving. More Than 300 Worked Out Problems (Several Of Them From National And International Olympiads) Share With The Student The Strategy, The Excitement, Motivation, Modeling, Manipulation, Abstraction, Notation And Ingenuity That Together Make Mathematics. This Would Be The Starting Point For The Student, Of A Life-Long Friendship With A Sound Mathematical Way Of Thinking.There Are Two Reasons Why The Book Should Be In The Hands Of Every School Or College Student, (Whether He Belongs To A Mathematics Stream Or Not) One, If He Likes Mathematics And, Two, If He Does Not Like Mathematics- The Former, So That The Cramped Robot-Type Treatment In The Classroom Does Not Make Him Into The Latter; And The Latter So That By The Time He Is Halfway Through The Book, He Will Invite Himself Into The Former.",

      description:
      "This multivolume work on the analysis of algorithms has long been recognised as the definitive description of classical computer science. The four volumes published to date already comprise a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth's writings. Scientists have marvelled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his \"cookbook\" solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humour found in his books. To continue the fourth and later volumes of the set, and to update parts of the existing volumes, Knuth has created a series of small books called fascicles, which are published at regular intervals. Each fascicle encompasses a section or more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete. This fascicle covers three separate topics: Mathematical Preliminaries. Knuth writes that this portion of fascicle 5 \"extends the 'Mathematical Preliminaries' of Section 1.2 in Volume 1 to things that I didn't know about in the 1960s. Most of this new material deals with probabilities and expectations of random events; there's also an introduction to the theory of martingales.\" Backtracking: this section is the counterpart to section 7.2.1 which covered the generation of basic combinatorial patterns. This section covers non-basic patterns, ones where the developer needs to make tentative choices and then may need to backtrack when those choices need revision. Dancing Links: this section is related to 2 above. It develops an important data structure technique that is suitable for backtrack programming described above.",
