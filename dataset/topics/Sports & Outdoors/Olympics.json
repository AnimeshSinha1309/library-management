The apotheosis of this cultural form is the Olympic Games. This challenging and provocative new book explores the Olympic spectacle, from the multi-media bidding process and the branding and imaging of the Games, to security, surveillance and control of the Olympic product across all of its levels. The book argues that the process of commercialization, directed by the IOC itself, has enabled audiences to interpret its traditional objects in non-reverential ways and to develop oppositional interpretations of Olympism. The Olympics have become multi-voiced and many themed, and the spectacle of the contemporary Games raises important questions about institutionalization, the doctrine of individualism, the advance of market capitalism, performance, consumption and the consolidation of global society. With particular focus on the London Games in 2012, the book casts a critical eye over the bidding process, Olympic finance, promises of legacy and development, and the consequences of hosting the Games for the civil rights and liberties of those living in their shadow. Few studies have offered such close scrutiny of the inner workings of Olympism\u00e2e(tm)s political and economic network, and, therefore, this book is indispensible reading for any student or researcher with an interest in the Olympics, sport's multiple impacts, or sporting mega-events.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415578332"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415578337"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 258, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7c9JaG-8oOMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7c9JaG-8oOMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7c9JaG-8oOMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7c9JaG-8oOMC&dq=Olympics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Watching_the_Olympics.html?hl=&id=7c9JaG-8oOMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7c9JaG-8oOMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "With particular focus on the London Games in 2012, the book casts a critical eye over the bidding process, Olympic finance, promises of legacy and development, and the consequences of hosting the Games for the civil rights and liberties of ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QmXi_-Jujj0C", "etag": "heezydJOGic", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QmXi_-Jujj0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Encyclopedia of the Modern Olympic Movement", "authors": ["John E.

Using as a backdrop the athletic events that draw television audiences in the billions, Allen Guttmann has written an interpretive social history of the games. What did the founders of the Olympic Games intend them to mean? And what have they, in the course of a century of tumultuous change, become? Guttmann probes the political, economic, social, and even religious significance of the games, presenting the most complete and readable account to date. In the broadest sense, Guttmann argues, politics has always been a part of the Olympics, not an occasional intruder whose presence may take the form of a boycott, protest, or act of terrorism. The book includes lively accounts of individual competitions. An early marathon through the streets of Paris, for example, brought complaints from the U.S. team that the course had been designed to allow French contestants to take shortcuts. Guttmann also provides insight into the behind-the-scenes maneuvering involved in site selection, as well as little-known facts about the general history of the games and about longtime IOC leader Avery Brundage.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "PSU:000023340466"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 191, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q23ZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q23ZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q23ZAAAAMAAJ&q=Olympics&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q23ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Olympics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Olympics.html?hl=&id=q23ZAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=q23ZAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book includes lively accounts of individual competitions."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cjn6srhMhbMC", "etag": "RSU1vNwHIw4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cjn6srhMhbMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Global Television And The Politics Of The Seoul Olympics", "authors": ["James F.

It's also well writen\u2026.Perhaps no book of the season will show us so briefly and entertainingly just how complete is our inheritance from the Greeks, vulgarity and all.\" --The Washington Post From the Trade Paperback edition.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781588363824"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1588363821"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.6.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&pg=PR17&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 581.45, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 290.72, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&rdid=book-B2VPMUBAxUUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 581450000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 290720000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Naked_Olympics-sample-epub.acsm?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Naked_Olympics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=B2VPMUBAxUUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Introduction: From Olympia to London GREEK PATRIOTS MAY look askance at <br>\nLondon hosting its third <b>Olympic</b> Games\u2014the only world city to do so in modern <br>\ntimes, in 1908, 1948, and now 2o12\u2014while the land of the event&#39;s ancient origins<br>\n&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "zr99d6AGPPIC", "etag": "glth0UJPJGs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zr99d6AGPPIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Olympics", "subtitle": "Facts, Figures and Fun", "authors": ["Liam McCann"], "publisher": "AAPPL", "publishedDate": "2005-09", "description": "A mix of history and trivia provides coverage of the Olympic games from the early competitions in Greece right up until today, discussing both the winter and summer games of the modern-day Olympics, as well as the Paralympics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1904332404"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781904332404"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 96, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zr99d6AGPPIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zr99d6AGPPIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zr99d6AGPPIC&pg=PA41&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zr99d6AGPPIC&dq=Olympics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Olympics.html?hl=&id=zr99d6AGPPIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zr99d6AGPPIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "2001-2004: The <b>Olympic</b> Movement publishes its revenue figures.

Few events will be held in Wales and it is not predicted that Wales will benefit greatly from tourism generated by the Games. An opportunity was missed in the original bid to locate events in Wales particularly in respect of mountain biking and canoeing. In retrospect, it now seems misguided to build expensive new venues when such facilities exist in Wales. Lottery funding will be diverted from Wales to fund the Games, with a loss of an estimated \u00a3100 million, which will have a long-term effect on grassroots projects with a reduction in the number of new facilities built and possible problems in maintaining current structures. The Government has launched the London 2012 Business Network and CompeteFor, but there Welsh companies currently only account for 2 per cent of all the total number of registrations on the CompeteFor network. The most obvious benefit to Wales arises from the fact that the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London provide a unique opportunity to generate interest in sport amongst children and young people. Disability sports is a great success story for Wales and the community programme ensures that there are opportunities for children and young people with disabilities.

Traditional Olympic studies have tended to examine the Games from an outsider's perspective or as something experienced through the print media or television. In contrast, the focus presented here is on the dynamics within the host city understood as a community of interacting individuals who encounter the Games in a variety of ways through support, opposition, or even indifference but who have a profound influence on the outcome of the Games as actors and players in the Olympics as a drama. Adopting a symbolic interactionist approach, the book offers a new interpretive model through which to understand the Olympic Games by exploring the relationship between the Games and residents of the host city. Key analytical concepts such as framing, dramaturgy, the public realm, and the symbolic field are introduced and illustrated through empirical research from the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games, and it is shown how the social media and shifts in public opinion reflected interaction effects within the city.

While the mythology of the ancient games has come to exemplify the highest political, religious, community, and individual ideals of the time, the modern Olympic Games, by comparison, are widely known as an international, bi-annual sporting event where champions have the potential to earn not only glory for their country, but lucrative endorsement deals and the perks of worldwide fame. The Olympics and Philosophy examines the Olympic Movement from a variety of theoretical perspectives to uncover the connection between athleticism and philosophy for a deeper appreciation of the Olympic Pillars of Sport, Environment, and Culture. While today's Olympic champions are neither blessed by the gods nor rewarded with wreaths of olive, the original spirit and ancient ideals of the Olympic Movement endure in its modern embodiment. Editors Heather L. Reid and Michael W. Austin have assembled a team of international scholars to explore topics such as the concept of excellence, ethics, doping, gender, and race.

This original work explores the encounter between \u2018the East and the West\u2019 by analyzing the deliberate self-presentational cultural diplomacy historically required of Asian Olympic hosts. Exploring the relationship between Modern Asia and the Olympic Games, it focuses on the forgotten history of the 1940 Tokyo Olympics to reveal the complex and fascinating encounter between Japan and the world in the 1930s. The book is the first full account of this encounter and draws substantially on Japanese sources hitherto unknown in the English-speaking world. It argues that this encounter sets the scene and the tone for later Asian involvement in the Olympic Movement.

Thus, the focus was not on the success or failure of this event, but on the ways in which the Olympics Games, as international and historic events, are memorialised by observers.

The Nazi Olympics opens with an analysis of Germany\u2019s preparations for the Games and the attempts by the Nazi regime to allay the international concerns about Hitler\u2019s racist ideals and expansionist ambitions. Essays follow on the United States, Great Britain, and France -- three first-class Olympian nations with misgivings about participation -- as well as German ally Italy and future ally Japan. Other essays examine the issues at stake in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands, which opposed Hitler\u2019s politics, despite embodying his Aryan ideal.

This book is a corrective. Drawing on newly available and hitherto unused archival sources, it demonstrates that India was an important strategic outpost in the Olympic movement that started as a global phenomenon at the turn of the twentieth century. Among the questions the authors answer are: When and how did the Olympic ideology take root in India? Who were the early players and why did they appropriate Olympic sport to further their political ambitions? What explains India's eight consecutive gold medals in Olympic men\u2019s hockey between 1928 and 1956 and what altered the situation drastically, so much so that the team failed to qualify for the 2008 Beijing Games? India and the Olympics also explores why the Indian elite became obsessed with the Olympic ideal at the turn of the twentieth century and how this obsession relates to India's quest for a national and international identity. It conclusively validates the contention that the essence of Olympism does not reside in medals won, records broken or television rights sold as ends in themselves. Particularly for India, the Olympic movement, including the relevant records and statistics, is important because it provides a unique prism to understand the complex evolution of modern Indian society.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135275754"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1135275750"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 528, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E3ONAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E3ONAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E3ONAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E3ONAgAAQBAJ&dq=Olympics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/India_and_the_Olympics.html?hl=&id=E3ONAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=E3ONAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "THE INDIAN ARMY AND ITS &#39;MISSION <b>OLYMPICS</b>&#39; A full four years after he won <br>\nthe silver at the Athens <b>Olympics</b> in 2004, the face of Lt.

Owning the Olympics tests the possibilities and limits of the concept of 'media events' by analyzing the mega-event of the information age: the Beijing Olympics. . . . A good read from cover to cover.\" \u2014Guobin Yang, Associate Professor, Asian/Middle Eastern Cultures & Sociology, Barnard College, Columbia University From the moment they were announced, the Beijing Games were a major media event and the focus of intense scrutiny and speculation. In contrast to earlier such events, however, the Beijing Games are also unfolding in a newly volatile global media environment that is no longer monopolized by broadcast media. The dramatic expansion of media outlets and the growth of mobile communications technology have changed the nature of media events, making it significantly more difficult to regulate them or control their meaning. This volatility is reflected in the multiple, well-publicized controversies characterizing the run-up to Beijing 2008. According to many Western commentators, the People's Republic of China seized the Olympics as an opportunity to reinvent itself as the \"New China\"---a global leader in economics, technology, and environmental issues, with an improving human-rights record. But China's maneuverings have also been hotly contested by diverse global voices, including prominent human-rights advocates, all seeking to displace the official story of the Games. Bringing together a distinguished group of scholars from Chinese studies, human rights, media studies, law, and other fields, Owning the Olympics reveals how multiple entities---including the Chinese Communist Party itself---seek to influence and control the narratives through which the Beijing Games will be understood. digitalculturebooks is an imprint of the University of Michigan Press and the Scholarly Publishing Office of the University of Michigan Library dedicated to publishing innovative and accessible work exploring new media and their impact on society, culture, and scholarly communication.

Inspired by Theodore Roosevelt, the nation\u2019s young, spirited, and athletic president, a sports mania rampaged across the country. Eager to celebrate its history, and to display its athletic potential, the United States hosted the world at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. One part of the World\u2019s Fair was the nation\u2019s first Olympic games. Revived in Greece in 1896, the Olympic movement was also young and energetic. In fact, the St. Louis Olympics were only the third in modern times. Although the games were originally awarded to Chicago, St. Louis wrestled them from her rival city against the wishes of International Olympic Committee President Pierre de Coubertin. Athletes came from eleven countries and four continents to compete in state-of-the-art facilities, which included a ten-thousand-seat stadium with gymnasium equipment donated by sporting goods magnate Albert Spalding. The 1904 St. Louis Olympics garnered only praise, and all agreed that the games were a success, improving both the profile of the Olympic movement and the prestige of the United States. But within a few years, the games of 1904 receded in memory. They suffered a worse fate with the publication of Coubertin\u2019s memoirs in 1931. His selective recollections, exaggerated claims, and false statements turned the forgotten Olympics into the failed Olympics. This prejudiced account was furthered by the 1948 publication of An Approved History of the Olympic Games by Bill Henry, which was reviewed and endorsed by Coubertin. America\u2019s First Olympics, by George R. Matthews, corrects common misconceptions that began with Coubertin\u2019s memoirs and presents a fresh view of the 1904 games, which featured first-time African American Olympians, an eccentric and controversial marathon, and documentation by pioneering photojournalist Jessie Tarbox Beals. Matthews provides an excellent overview of the St. Louis Olympics over a six-month period, beginning with the intrigue surrounding the transfer of the games from Chicago. He also gives detailed descriptions of the major players in the Olympic movement, the events that were held in 1904, and the athletes who competed in them. This original account will be welcomed by history and sports enthusiasts who are interested in a new perspective on this misunderstood event.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10",

The studies have been updated with addenda by the original authors, and two of the articles that were originally published in German or French have been translated into English here for the first time. The studies, selected for breadth and importance of historical topics, include: Greek sport in its epic, heroic, and Bronze Age origins; the ancient Olympics in its relation to religion, politics, and diversity of competitors; Greek events in track and field and equestrian events. A companion second volume complements this one with studies on the social and economic aspects of Greek sport, the role of Greek sport in the Roman era, and forms, functions and venues of Roman spectacles.

A lucid and penetrating look at the five-ringed world, filled with Dick Pound's customary insight, frankness and wit. Inside the Olympics wins gold, silver and bronze.\" - John Powers, Boston Globe Every two years, world attention turns to the Olympic Games for a few short weeks, in a celebration of athletic excellence, competition, and national pride. But in recent years, the Olympic ideal has also been tainted by scandals, greed, and corruption-from bribery, to doing, cheating, politics, and exploitation. Never shy of the issues, Dick Pound reveals the full inside story-both good and bad-of the Games. An Olympian himself, and long-time IOC insider, Pound sheds a bright light on many controversial events and issues surrounding the Olympics, including the conduct of IOC officials, and the doping scandals that he considers the greatest threat to sports today. He also offers a fascinating look at negotiations in the high-stake worlds of television rights and corporate sponsorships, and at the politics, backstabbing, and intrigues that take place behind the scenes in the world of international sports. At times damning, at others prescriptive, sometimes amusing, but always honest and insightful, Inside the Olympics gives a rare personal view on the business, the personalities, the ideals, and the organization behind the world's greatest sporting event.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0470838701"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780470838709"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=laI4PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=laI4PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=laI4PwAACAAJ&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=laI4PwAACAAJ&dq=Olympics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Inside_the_Olympics.html?hl=&id=laI4PwAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=laI4PwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot;The only man who could have written this book has done it with candor and style.

Goldblatt brilliantly traces their history from the reinvention of the Games in Athens in 1896 to Rio in 2016, revealing how the Olympics developed into a global colossus and highlighting how they have been buffeted by (and affected by) domestic and international conflicts. Along the way, Goldblatt reveals the origins of beloved Olympic traditions (winners\u2019 medals, the torch relay, the eternal flame) and popular events (gymnastics, alpine skiing, the marathon). And he delivers memorable portraits of Olympic icons from Jesse Owens to Nadia Comaneci, the Dream Team to Usain Bolt.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780393254112"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0393254119"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 2.5, "ratingsCount": 14, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.7.7.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dxqZCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dxqZCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dxqZCgAAQBAJ&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dxqZCgAAQBAJ&dq=Olympics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Games_A_Global_History_of_the_Olympi.html?hl=&id=dxqZCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dxqZCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Goldblatt brilliantly traces their history from the reinvention of the Games in Athens in 1896 to Rio in 2016, revealing how the Olympics developed into a global colossus and highlighting how they have been buffeted by (and affected by) ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QJgYCM450lIC", "etag": "kTdnVHZxY+M", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QJgYCM450lIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Eyewitness Guides: Olympics", "subtitle": "Olympics", "authors": ["Chris Oxlade", "David Ballheimer"], "publisher": "Dorling Kindersley Ltd", "publishedDate": "2004-05-06", "description": "Do you know why athletes used to compete in the nude?

This study questions the supremacy of the IOC, arguing that there is a significant accountability deficit. Investigating the conduct of the IOC from an international legal perspective, the book moves beyond a critique of the IOC to explore potential avenues for reform, means of improving democratic procedures and increasing accountability. If the Olympics are to continue to be our most celebrated sporting event, those who organise them must be answerable to the citizens that they can potentially harm as well as benefit.

Danyel Reiche reassesses our understanding of success in sport and challenges the conventional explanations that population size and economic strength are the main determinants for a country\u2019s Olympic achievements. He presents a theory of countries\u2019 success and failure, based on detailed investigations of the relationships between a wide variety of factors that influence a country\u2019s position in the Olympic medals table, including geography, ideology, policies such as focusing on medal promising sports, home advantage and the promotion of women.

In this new edition he takes aim at the outrageous FIFA scandal, Boston\u2019s bid for the 2024 summer Olympics, and the criticism surrounding the 2015 Women's World Cup. Circus Maximus focuses on major cities, like London and Barcelona, that have previously hosted these sporting events, to provide context for cities like Tokyo and Rio de Janerio, which are currently bearing the weight of exploding expenses, corruption, and protests.

event\u2014a global celebration of exceptional athletics gilded with corporate cash. Huge corporations vie for association with the \"Olympic Image\" in the hope of gaining a worldwide marketing audience of billions. In this provocative critical study of the contemporary Olympics, Jules Boykoff argues that the Games have become a massive planned economy designed to shield the rich from risk while providing them with a spectacle to treasure. Placing political economy at the center of the analysis, and drawing on interdisciplinary research in sociology, politics, geography, history, and economics, Boykoff develops an innovative theory of \"celebration capitalism\", the manipulation of state actors as partners that drives us towards public\u2013private partnerships in which the public pays and the private profits. He argues that the Athens Games in 2004 marked the full emergence of celebration capitalism, with London 2012 representing its quintessential expression, characterized by a state of exception, unfettered commercialism, repression of dissent, questionable sustainability claims, and the complicity of the mainstream media. Controversial, challenging, and forthright, this book opens up a fascinating new avenue for understanding the contemporary Olympics in the context of global capitalist society. It is essential reading for anybody with an interest in the Olympic Games, the relationship between sport and society, or global politics and culture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135938338"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1135938334"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 184, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-MdaSAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Celebration_Capitalism_and_the_Olympic_G-sample-epub.acsm?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Celebration_Capitalism_and_the_Olympic_G-sample-pdf.acsm?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MdaSAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Controversial, challenging, and forthright, this book opens up a fascinating new avenue for understanding the contemporary Olympics in the context of global capitalist society."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xILFBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "x+9ZyVStbZA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xILFBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Politics of the Olympics", "subtitle": "A Survey", "authors": ["Alan Bairner", "Gyozo Molnar"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2010-03-09", "description": "With the ever increasing global significance of the Olympic Games, it has never been more topical to address the political issues that surround, influence and emanate from this quadrennial sporting mega event. In terms of the most recent evidence of the politics of the Olympics, the 2008 Beijing Games were riddled with political messages and content from the outset, and provided a global stage for protesters with numerous agendas. These included, to name but a few, proposed boycotts, potential terrorist attacks, the question of open media access, protests against China\u2019s political practices and attempts to interrupt the \u2018traditional\u2019 torch rally. Essays in this collection focus on numerous political aspects of the Olympics from a variety of different perspectives, with a Glossary that contains a range of politically relevant entries relating to famous and infamous Olympic athletes, Olympic movement personnel and events and broader political issues and developments which have affected the modern Games. The purpose of this anthology is not to perpetuate hatred towards the concept and practices of Olympism or to regurgitate a \u2018celebratory party line\u2019. Instead, in addition to being informative, the book offers critical engagement with the Olympics by raising awareness of the movement\u2019s political significance.

Although the games were held without major incident, the economic, environmental, political, and social outcomes for Brazil ranged from disappointing to devastating. Corruption scandals trimmed the fat profits that many local real estate developers had envisioned, and the local government was driven into bankruptcy. At the other end of the economic spectrum, some 77,000 residents of Rio's poorest neighborhoods\u2014the favelas\u2014were evicted and forced to move, in many cases as far as 20 or 30 miles to the west.

The Munich Olympics. Palestinian members of the Black September group murder eleven Israeli athletes. Nine hundred million people watch the crisis unfold on television, witnessing a tragedy that inaugurates the modern age of terror and remains a scar on the collective conscience of the world. Back in Israel, Prime Minister Golda Meir vows to track down those responsible and, in Menachem Begin\u2019s words, \u201crun these criminals and murderers off the face of the earth.\u201d A secret Mossad unit, code named Caesarea, is mobilized, a list of targets drawn up. Thus begins the Israeli response\u2013a mission that unfolds not over months but over decades. The Mossad has never spoken about this operation. No one has known the real story. Until now. Award-winning journalist Aaron Klein\u2019s incisive and riveting account tells for the first time the full story of Munich and the Israeli counterterrorism operation it spawned. With unprecedented access to Mossad agents and an unparalleled knowledge of Israeli intelligence, Klein peels back the layers of myth and misinformation that have permeated previous books, films, and magazine articles about the \u201cshadow war\u201d against Black September and other terrorist groups. Spycraft, secret diplomacy, and fierce detective work abound in a story with more drama than any fictional thriller. Burning questions are at last answered, including who was killed and who was not, how it was done, which targets were hit and which were missed. Truths are revealed: the degree to which the Mossad targeted nonaffiliated Black September terrorists for assassination, the length and full scope of the operation (far greater than previously suspected), retributive acts against Israel, and much more. Finally, Klein shows that the Israeli response to Munich was not simply about revenge, as is popularly believed. By illuminating the tactical and strategic purposes of the Israeli operation, Striking Back allows us to draw profoundly relevant lessons from one of the most important counterterrorism campaigns in history.

He is a perfectionist who once soled his shoes with rubber from Ferrari tyres because he thought it would help. He would wake up at 3 am to practise at his range at home if an idea suddenly struck him. It is from such obsession that greatness arrives. Abhinav Bindra's journey to become the first Indian to win an individual Olympic gold, and the first Indian to win a World Championship gold, is a story of single-minded passion. The Olympics has been an all-consuming journey for him ever since he was shattering beer bottles and glass ampoules in his garden in Chandigarh. No obstacle was too hard to overcome, no amount of practice too much, no experiment too futile and no defeat so severe that it made a comeback impossible. Shattered by his failure at the 2004 Athens Olympics when a gold medal seemed imminent, he changed as a shooter: from a boy who loved shooting, he became an athlete bent on redemption, a scientist who would try anything - from mapping his own brain to drinking yak milk to climbing rock walls - to win at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. His victory was not just a personal triumph, it was a gift to his nation, a breaking down of a sporting barrier that had stood for a century. Bindra's feat has taught his peers, and those yet to come, that an Olympic gold isn't an impossible dream. In ranges, on fields, in arenas, Indian athletes now own a new belief, they wear the knowledge that no challenge is beyond them. Helping to tell this remarkable story is sportswriter Rohit Brijnath, who collaborated with Bindra in producing this compelling autobigraphy of one of India's greatest sportsmen.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789350292969"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9350292963"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 264, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 251.85, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 176.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-6bPlAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 251850000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 176300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Shot_At_History_My_Obsessive_Journey_t-sample-epub.acsm?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6bPlAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Helping to tell this remarkable story is sportswriter Rohit Brijnath, who collaborated with Bindra in producing this compelling autobigraphy of one of India&#39;s greatest sportsmen."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "mRQyyxl23NUC", "etag": "W4AuZ3fBUZo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mRQyyxl23NUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Amateurs", "subtitle": "The Story of Four Young Men and Their Quest for an Olympic Gold Medal", "authors": ["David Halberstam"], "publisher": "Open Road Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-18", "description": "In \u201cone of the best books ever written about a sport,\u201d Halberstam chronicles the story of four amateur US rowers and their 1984 Olympic dream (Newsweek). In 1984, rowing was a sport continually relegated to the margins, far from the spotlights attracted by other Olympic events. That year, four men went head-to-head for the right to compete for gold as the United States\u2019 single sculler, an honor that would lead not to lucrative endorsement deals, but to the fleeting glory of the Olympic Games, and the satisfaction of ranking supreme among their competitive community of oarsmen. In pursuit of that goal, the rowers pushed through crippling pain, delaying personal relationships and careers, all for the rush of winning. Determined to understand these athletes of a seemingly bygone era, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist and author David Halberstam chronicles their bravery and obsession, delivering a dramatic human story, buzzing with adrenaline, about the lengths to which athletes will go to prove their mettle and compete on the highest level.

What are the interorganizational flows of authority and finance between them? How is work grouped, in what unit sizes, how specialized and formalized are work processes? How complex, dynamic, diversified, or friendly is their environment? What are the power issues and how do the technological processes affect these organizations? How do the OCOGs evolve in their life cycle, what pressures shape their structures and management processes and how is work co-ordinated? The examination of the Olympic Games event organization in the 10-year period, from bidding to post-games closing down, draws material from host cities to explore the types of interorganizational flows that take place at various stages for the Olympic Games to be delivered. Knowledge transfer from one host city to the next and an established organizational field also means that management practises sometimes follow some externally imposed organizing logics. The challenges faced by organizers are discussed and the tensions that a strong management template from the IOC creates are also examined. Finally, the issue of sustainability of the Olympic Games is identified along with an analysis of the ways in which the concepts of impact are appropriated by the various stakeholders involved with the Olympic Games as they attempt to influence public opinion.

The interpretive strengths of this method sharpen the analytical perspective of the chapters, with the strict requirements for the use of primary sources meaning that the contributors have conducted extensive archival research. Assuring thematic coherence, the studies assembled for this book focus on the analysis of processes of continuity, transformation, and development across four areas: sport institutions and their policies; commissions within and policies of governing bodies of sports; legacy discussions; and sport events within the summer and winter Olympic Games transformed into political and cultural spectacles.

One moment Josh Sundquist was your typical energetic and inquisitive nine year- old boy. The next, his entire life changed when he was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a particularly virulent cancer strain that would eventually claim Josh's left leg. Told in a wide-eyed, winning, heartbreaking voice, Just Don't Fall is the story of the boy Josh was and of the young man he became. His story begins in a small, close-knit Southern town, where his father-an aspiring pastor questioning his faith, and his mother-- homeschooling an ever- growing brood of children-struggle to make ends meet. Josh journeys through a dizzying array of hospitals and eventually lands at a pivotal place: the nearby mountain, where he makes his first attempt to ski. It is on the slopes, and later, on the race course, that Josh's world bursts wide open in a way no one could have ever anticipated. The inspiration to ski, however, and to become a champion, is not all that Josh has to contend with- there is adolescence to navigate, the transition from homeschool to public high school, and girls. There is an increasingly turbulent and difficult home life, with another cancer scare, a wayward brother, and dwindling finances to pay for training. Finally, there is the wild, bumpy road to the Paralympics in Turin, with a misanthropic coach, training in the Rockies, and a timeless friendship with a charismatic, imposing Brooklyn homeboy named Ralph. Through it all, Josh is forced to question his abilities, his sanity, his will, his faith in himself, and his faith in God. Because of, not despite, these myriad obstacles in his path, Josh is able to achieve a genuine grace: the grace to risk failure and to succeed. It is the grace of a young boy becoming a man and of a champion realizing his greatest dream. Josh Sundquist shows us with charm, humility and remarkable strength that even if we fall, this inner grace can lift us up and carry us over the many mountains we all must face.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781101189887"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1101189886"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 8, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uk075GoCNRoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uk075GoCNRoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Uk075GoCNRoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Olympics&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Uk075GoCNRoC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Uk075GoCNRoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 872.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 436.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Uk075GoCNRoC&rdid=book-Uk075GoCNRoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 872160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 436080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Just_Don_t_Fall-sample-epub.acsm?id=Uk075GoCNRoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Uk075GoCNRoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Told in a wide-eyed, winning, heartbreaking voice, Just Don&#39;t Fall is the story of the boy Josh was and of the young man he became."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "-kQlDgAAQBAJ", "etag": "n+YcIOhlWtk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/-kQlDgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Olympic Education", "subtitle": "An international review", "authors": ["Roland Naul", "Deanna Binder", "Antonin Rychtecky", "Ian Culpan"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2017-02-17", "description": "A fundamental component of the Olympic ideal is the concept of Olympic education.

The book includes 28 chapters with 21 national case studies of countries on every major continent, including Australia, Brasil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Spain, the UK, the US and Zambia. Each chapter examines the cultural, pedagogical, political and societal challenges of teaching Olympic education, as well as the national, individual and institutional programmes that have emerged. It explores key practical and conceptual issues, such as the incorporation of Olympic values in PE curricula, sport coaching and coach education programmes, while also taking into account the collaborative efforts of the governmental bodies, sport federations and Olympic institutions responsible for policy and implementation.
