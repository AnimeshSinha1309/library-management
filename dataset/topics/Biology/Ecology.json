Marcus. The \"Advances in Morphometries\" ASI was advertised in Nature and a number of professional journals. Announcements were sent to relevant institutions and departments throughout the world. Because NATO required that the majority of attendees be from NATO countries, the 71 persons attending represented nine NATO countries, four eastern European countries, now recognized as equal partners for AS Is, and a few participants from non-NATO countries. Participants were all active scholars in different disciplines within biology, as well as computer science, statistics, geology and paleontology. Their experience ranged from that of graduate students to senior faculty, as well as one emeritus scholar. A complete list of the those attending and their addresses, phone and FAX numbers and, where available, e-mail addresses is given in the participants list. All the local arrangements were made by Marco Corti and Anna Loy of the University of Rome \"Ia Sapienza. \" They made the initial contact with the II Ciocco conference center and then arranged for computer and Xerox rentals, design of logos, organization of posters, and publication of poster abstracts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781475790832"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "147579083X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 588, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-xwLqBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Advances_in_Morphometrics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xwLqBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "d6iwJ8FR6oIC", "etag": "GKq8R09tB1Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/d6iwJ8FR6oIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecological Economics", "subtitle": "A Practical Programme for Global Reform", "authors": ["Group of Green Economists"], "publisher": "Zed Books", "publishedDate": "1992", "description": "Analisi : ECONOMIA AMBIENTALE.

Occupying a crucial place between land and sea, these tidal ecosystems provide a valuable ecological and economic resource as important nursery grounds and breeding sites for many organisms, and as a renewable source of wood and traditional foods and medicines. Perhaps most importantly, they are accumulation sites for sediment, contaminants, carbon and nutrients, and offer significant protection against coastal erosion. This book presents a functional overview of mangrove forest ecosystems; how they live and grow at the edge of tropical seas, how they play a critical role along most of the world\u2019s tropical coasts, and how their future might look in a world affected by climate change. Such a process-oriented approach is necessary in order to further understand the role of these dynamic forests in ecosystem function, and as a first step towards developing adequate strategies for their conservation and sustainable use and management.

Our intended audience is field ecologists in general and, in particular, wildlife and fisheries biologists who are attempting to measure the extent to which real animal populations are selective in their choice of food and habitat. As such, we have made no attempt to address those aspects of theoretical ecology that are concerned with how animals might choose their resources if they acted in an optimal manner. The book is based on the concept of a resource selection function (RSF), where this is a function of characteristics measured on resourceunits such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used. We argue that this concept leads to a unified theory for the analysis and interpretation of data on resource selection and can replace many ad hoc statistical methods that have been used in the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306481512"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306481510"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Resource_Selection_by_Animals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8ES9BAAAQBAJ", "etag": "nr30iSeKmFw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8ES9BAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Spatial Database for GPS Wildlife Tracking Data", "subtitle": "A Practical Guide to Creating a Data Management System with PostgreSQL/PostGIS and R", "authors": ["Ferdinando Urbano", "Francesca Cagnacci"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2014-03-12", "description": "This book guides animal ecologists, biologists and wildlife and data managers through a step-by-step procedure to build their own advanced software platforms to manage and process wildlife tracking data. This unique, problem-solving-oriented guide focuses on how to extract the most from GPS animal tracking data, while preventing error propagation and optimizing analysis performance. Based on the open source PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial database, the software platform will allow researchers and managers to integrate and harmonize GPS tracking data together with animal characteristics, environmental data sets, including remote sensing image time series, and other bio-logged data, such as acceleration data. Moreover, the book shows how the powerful R statistical environment can be integrated into the software platform, either connecting the database with R, or embedding the same tools in the database through the PostgreSQL extension Pl/R. The client/server architecture allows users to remotely connect a number of software applications that can be used as a database front end, including GIS software and WebGIS. Each chapter offers a real-world data management and processing problem that is discussed in its biological context; solutions are proposed and exemplified through ad hoc SQL code, progressively exploring the potential of spatial database functions applied to the respective wildlife tracking case. Finally, wildlife tracking management issues are discussed in the increasingly widespread framework of collaborative science and data sharing. GPS animal telemetry data from a real study, freely available online, are used to demonstrate the proposed examples.

SPEDDING v Preface to the First Edition The agricultural systems of the world represent a very large subject. Their study involves a great deal of fairly detailed knowledge, as well as a grasp of the structures and functions of the systems themselves. This book has been written as an introduction to such a study and it concentrates on an overall view, rather than on the detail, partly because of the need to relate the latter to some larger picture in order to appreciate the relevance and significance of the detail. This problem-of seeing the relevance of component studies and the significance of physical, biological and economic detail, and indeed principles-is encountered by many agricultural students right at the beginning of their university careers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401164085"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401164088"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 190, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-sEHwCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/An_Introduction_to_Agricultural_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "E7R2q19X3toC", "etag": "K/iJTGexQeY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/E7R2q19X3toC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Population Systems", "subtitle": "A General Introduction", "authors": ["Alan A.

The Biodiversity section emphasises the vast range of life forms in tropical forests and considers the theory and practice of estimating species richness and spatial distribution, while contributions on Forest Dynamics provide a better understanding of the maintenance of this species richness. With an improved background of ideas on rainforest dynamics and biodiversity, better management and conservation strategies are possible, and some of these are explored in the papers on Socioeconomics.

As a result of alarmingly rapid declines in biodiversity in the modern era, there is a strong, worldwide desire to upgrade our monitoring systems, but little clarity on what is actually needed and how it can be assembled from the elements which are already present. This book intends to provide practical guidance to broadly-defined biodiversity observation networks at all scales, but predominantly the national scale and higher.

They spawn and die in the middle of the ocean, often associated with undersea mountains. Their tra- parent, leaf-like larvae move with ocean currents for months or years until they approach the mouths of freshwater rivers. Then they undergo a dramatic transf- mation in morphology, physiology and behavior. They move from their planktonic oceanic environment, migrate upstream and live for several years as apex fre- water predators. Then, almost impossibly, as they become sexually mature, they reverse their migration downstream to the ocean and back to spawning grounds to complete their life cycle. The dramatic changes in their life cycles are incredible. The efforts to unravel the details of their life history have been truly daunting. Much of the past research was the work of dedicated individuals who devoted their lifetime research to these fishes. Freshwater eels merit a separate chapter in almost any textbook dealing with ichthyology, marine biology or animal migration. We know a great deal about some aspects of the biology of freshwater eels. However, our understanding of their bi- ogy still resembles a work of art as much as a work of science. To some it appears like the sweeping brush strokes of a Japanese Zen landscape, to others it resembles the work of a French impressionist, and to still others it appears as magic realism.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402090950"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1402090951"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 477, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ctln9iiU9uwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&rdid=book-ctln9iiU9uwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Spawning_Migration_of_the_European_Eel-sample-epub.acsm?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Spawning_Migration_of_the_European_Eel-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ctln9iiU9uwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sMfcBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "qKwqWIfeK18", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sMfcBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Concepts of Ecosystem Ecology", "subtitle": "A Comparative View", "authors": ["Lawrence R.

Ram6n Margalef, 1968. It was a great honor for me to have been asked by Marinus Werger to write an introductory note to this very special volume. Presumably my friends and former students in Europe felt that a few words from the New World might put the results presented in this exciting book into a somewhat broader perspective. My perspective (or retrospective), however, is neither impersonal nor original; it is an eclectic reflection of recent developments in ecology and in old-field ecology in particular. The ecological generalizations and theories of Ram6n Margalef and Eugene P. Odum, as we perceived them in Prague in the early 1970s, were for some of us so attractive and promising that we even started to believe it would not take too long until we had a truly unifying general theory of ecological succession. All that was needed - we thought - were data clarifying a few controversial issues. This is how our studies of old-field succession began in 1973. We viewed old-fields as a sort of 'Drosophila' for terrestrial ecology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400924444"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400924445"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 169, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Succession_in_Abandoned_Fields-sample-pdf.acsm?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7Ar8CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "p7AsBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "N3fhiXA4odU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/p7AsBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "An Introduction to Phytoplanktons: Diversity and Ecology", "authors": ["Ruma Pal", "Avik Kumar Choudhury"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16", "description": "The book , \u2018An Introduction to Phytoplanktons - Diversity and Ecology\u2019 is very useful as it covers wide aspects of phytoplankton study including the general idea about cyanobacteria and algal kingdom.

Conservation planning has received a great deal of coverage and research as a way of conserving biodiversity yet, while theoretically successful, it has never been tested. Simple lines on maps to illustrate conservation areas are unlikely to be successful in the light of human encroachment. It may be that some form of overt display is necessary to ensure the protection of reserves. This may be signage, presence of guards/rangers or physical fencing structures. The need for some form of barrier goes beyond restricting human access. The megafauna of Africa pose a genuine threat to human survival. In southern Africa, fences keep animals in and protect the abutting human population. Elsewhere, fencing is not considered important or viable. Where poverty is rife, it won\u2019t take much to tip the balance from beneficial conservation areas to troublesome repositories of crop-raiders, diseases and killers. Conversely, in New Zealand fences are used to keep animals out. Introduced species have decimated New Zealand\u2019s endemic birds, reptiles and invertebrates, and several sites have been entirely encapsulated in mouse-proof fencing to ensure their protection. Australia faces the same problems as New Zealand, however surrounds its national parks with cattle fences. Foxes and cats are free to enter and leave at will, resulting in rapid recolonisation following poisoning campaigns. How long will these poison campaigns work before tolerance, aversion or resistance evolves in the introduced predator populations?", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461409020"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461409021"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.8.8.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15812, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15812, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&rdid=book-3aW8kIJUB1wC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15812000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15812000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Fencing_for_Conservation-sample-epub.acsm?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Fencing_for_Conservation-sample-pdf.acsm?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3aW8kIJUB1wC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "5Np9rU_0pPEC", "etag": "LKJHBRoQfhA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5Np9rU_0pPEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Design and Analysis of Long-term Ecological Monitoring Studies", "authors": ["Robert A.

Ecology, the science that underpins the technol ogy of conservation, is still too immature to provide all the wisdom that it must. It is arguable that the desire to conserve nature will in itself force the discipline of ecology to identify fundamental prob lems in its scientific goals and methods. In return, ecologists may be able to offer some insights that make conservation more practicable (Harper 1987). The idea that nature (species or communities) is worth preserv ing rests on several fundamental arguments, particularly the argu ment of nostalgia and the argument of human benefit and need. Nostalgia, of course, is a powerful emotion. With some notable ex ceptions, there is usually a feeling of dismay at a change in the sta tus quo, whether it be the loss of a place in the country for walking or rambling, the loss of a painting or architectural monument, or that one will never again have the chance to see a particular species of bird or plant.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468464269"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468464264"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 507, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yRLrBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Conservation_Biology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tLLoCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "XWICiO0VJ4s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tLLoCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Alpine Plant Life", "subtitle": "Functional Plant Ecology of High Mountain Ecosystems", "authors": ["Christian K\u00f6rner"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "Generations of plant scientists have been fascinated by alpine plant lifean ecosystem that experiences dramatic climatic gradients over a very short distance.

As such, it is supposed to have the strictest form of government protection available in Canada, with development, motorised transportation and recreational activities either tightly controlled or altogether forbidden. This has not been the case, however. Using a stunning combination of drawn and painted images, conventional and remote photography (using hidden cameras activated by heat or motion) and traditional stories told by Peigan and Stoney Nakoda people, Enns invites the reader to join her as she untangles old myths regarding Albertas heritage and reveals some uncomfortable realities facing the province in the 21st century. The wild horses, wolves, moose, deer and bears profiled in this book have had little contact with humankind. As communities, developers and governments struggle to understand the affects of conservation, recreation and development in sacred places, it is becoming more and more difficult to keep the wild in wild animals.
