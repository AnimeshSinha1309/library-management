Combining in himself the passion of an entrepreneur, the mind of a nerd, the discipline of an athlete, the curiosity of an explorer, the heart of a patriot and the soul of a philosopher, Milind has made the stunning-and apparently seamless- transition from champion swimmer to supermodel to actor to extreme sportsperson to women's fitness activist, enabler and proselytiser, all in one lifetime. How does he do it? What makes him tick? On the twenty-fifth anniversary of 'Made in India', the breakout pop music video of the 1990s that captured the apna-time-aagaya zeitgeist of post-liberalization India and made him the nation's darling across genders and generations, Milind talks about his fascinating life-controversies, relationships, the breaking of vicious habits like smoking, alcohol, rage, and more-in a freewheeling, bare-all (easy, ladies-we're talking soul-wise!) memoir. Co-authored with bestselling author Roopa Pai, MADE IN INDIA is a rare glimpse into the mind and heart of a very unusual man that will leave you thoughtful, awed and inspired.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789353057459"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9353057450"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 358.72, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 251.1, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-9GjLDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 358720000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 251100000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Made_in_India-sample-epub.acsm?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Made_in_India-sample-pdf.acsm?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9GjLDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Co-authored with bestselling author Roopa Pai, MADE IN INDIA is a rare glimpse into the mind and heart of a very unusual man that will leave you thoughtful, awed and inspired."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "BohjDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Hjis+up74iI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BohjDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "True Life Stories: The Greatest Native American Memoirs & Biographies", "subtitle": "Geronimo, Charles Eastman, Black Hawk, King Philip, Sitting Bull & Crazy Horse", "authors": ["Geronimo", "John Stevens Cabot Abbott", "Black Hawk", "Charles M.

As part of the campaign, Kaur's post made her the target of an onslaught of social media vitriol. Kaur, the daughter of a Kargil war martyr, suddenly became the focal point of a nationalism debate. Facing a trial by social media, Kaur almost retreated into herself. But she was never brought up to be silenced. 'Real bullets killed my father. Your hate bullets are deepening my resolve,' she wrote then. Today, Kaur is doubly determined not to be silent. Small Acts of Freedom is her story. This is the story of three generations of strong, passionate single women in one family, women who have faced the world on their own terms. With an unusual narrative structure that crisscrosses elegantly between the past and the present, spanning seventy years from 1947 to 2017, Small Acts of Freedom is about courage. It's about resilience, strength and love. From her grandmother who came to India from Lahore after Partition to the whirlwind romance between her parents, from her father's state funeral to her harrowing experiences since her days of student activism, Gurmehar Kaur's debut is about the fierceness of love, the power of family, and the little acts that beget big revolutions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789387326675"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9387326675"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 268.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 145.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 268820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 145160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Acts_of_Freedom-sample-epub.acsm?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Acts_of_Freedom-sample-pdf.acsm?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mJ1IDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Today, Kaur is doubly determined not to be silent.

India's independence from the British Raj was accompanied by the division of the country into India and Pakistan, a divide which resulted in unspeakable violence with the death of close to two million people.

The train was ambushed and almost all the Muslims men were killed on the spot and women abducted. Miraculously, a young Hindu put his own life in danger to save most of Zahir's family.

Courting Destiny traces the remarkable story of his life---the family's origins in the town of Bijnor in the United Provinces, the experience of growing up in a joint family in Allahabad, initial encounters with the law when the Constitution of India was being framed, the distinguished career as a lawyer and law minister, culminating in the campaign for judicial accountability. These memoirs provide a participant's account of some of the most interesting and seminal cases that laid the foundations of India's constitutional history. They include the Keshav Singh case of 1964 which led to the first standoff between the executive and the judiciary; Indira Gandhi's election case which unseated her as prime minister, leading to the imposition of the Emergency; the habeas corpus case where the Supreme Court declared that during an emergency there is no right to life or liberty and hence no recourse against illegal detention; and the parliament attack case in which the Supreme Court, while acquitting Shaukat Guru of all charges of conspiracy, convicted him on a charge for which he was never accused. Together, they offer a broad perspective of the evolution of Indian law and the interpretation of the Constitution. Courting Destiny affords us a glimpse of the many fundamental and far-reaching political and constitutional changes that took place in the decades following independence. The descriptions of Shanti Bhushan's brief involvement in party politics and his time as law minister in the post-Emergency Janata government make for a fascinating insider's account of an important phase of the nation's life. In this narration of the author's life and work, the personal, the professional and the public unfold seamlessly, never at the cost of one or the other. Written in a direct and engaging style, laced with gentle humour, Courting Destiny will appeal to all those interested in India's legal, constitutional and political history. At a time when both the Bar and the Bench are under a cloud, the illustrious sixty-year career of Shanti Bhushan will be a source of inspiration for young advocates.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789385990533"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9385990535"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 767, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 414.18, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qx1wDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 767000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 414180000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Courting_Destiny-sample-epub.acsm?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qx1wDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Courting Destiny traces the remarkable story of his life---the family&#39;s origins in the town of Bijnor in the United Provinces, the experience of growing up in a joint family in Allahabad, initial encounters with the law when the ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "NlnrBgAAQBAJ", "etag": "seCPHfFGLVM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NlnrBgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Memoirs of an Indian Woman", "authors": ["Shudha Mazumdar", "Geraldine Hancock Forbes"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2015-03-04", "description": "This vivid memoir recounts the experience of Shudha Mazumdar, a woman born at the turn of the century to Indian parents whose ideas on child rearing differed greatly.

Along the way, he recounts his passages through Aligarh University, the National School of Drama and the Film and Television Institute of India, where his luck finally began to change. And Then One Day tells a compelling tale, written with rare honesty and consummate elegance, leavened with tongue-in-cheek humour. There are moving portraits of family members, darkly funny accounts of his schooldays, and vivid cameos of directors and actors he has worked with, among them Ebrahim Alkazi, Shyam Benegal, Girish Karnad, Om Puri and Shabana Azmi. The accounts of his struggle to earn a living through acting, his experiments with the craft, his love affairs, his early marriage, his successes and failures are narrated with remarkable frankness and objective self-assessment.

When I was a few minutes old, Grandmother welcomed me into the world by writing \"Om\", which means \"I am\" in Sanskrit, on my tongue with a little finger dipped in honey. When the family priest arrived to draw up my horoscope, he scribbled astrological symbols on a long scroll and set down a name for me, Indrani, or \"queen of the heavens\". My father ignored him completely and proclaimed my name was to be Madhur (\"sweet as honey\").' So begins Madhur Jaffrey's enchanting memoir of her childhood in India. Her description of growing up a in a very large, wealthy family (half a train was booked to transport the family from Delhi to the mountains for the summer) conjures up the spirit of a long lost age. Whether climbing the mango trees in her grandparents' orchard, armed with a mixture of salt, pepper, red chillies and roasted cumin, or enjoying picnics in the foothills of the Himalayas, reached by foot, rickshaw, palanquin or horse, where meatballs stuffed with sultanas and mint leaves, cauliflowers flavoured with ginger and coriander, and spiced pooris with hot green mango pickle were devoured, food forms a major leitmotiv of this beautifully written memoir.

Many of these narratives are as-told-to autobiographies, and those who labored to set them down in writing are nearly as diverse as their subjects. Black Elk had a poet for his amanuensis; Maxidiwiac, a Hidatsa farmer who worked her fields with a bone-blade hoe, had an anthropologist. Two Leggings, the man who led the last Crow war party, speaks to us through a merchant from Bismarck, North Dakota. White Horse Eagle, an aged Osage, told his story to a Nazi historian. \u00f8 By discussing these remarkable narratives from a historical perspective, H.

There are far more uncertainties that an Indian manager has to encounter while performing his tasks-even more so in state-owned companies, often synonymous with inefficiency, than in private ones. But Krishnamurthy, through his exemplary stewardship of three enterprises, emerged as the pride of India's public sector in the 1970s and 1980s.

It shows how survivors script their life stories to reinscribe tragic tales of violence and abjection into triumphalist sagas of fortitude, resilience, industry, enterprise and success. At the same time, it reveals the silences, stutters and stammers that interrupt survivors\u2019 narrations to bring attention to the untold stories repressed in their consensual narratives. By drawing upon current research in history, memory, narrative, violence, trauma, affect, home, nation, borders, refugees and citizenship, the book analyzes the traumatizing effects of both the tangible and intangible violence of Partition by tracing the survivors\u2019 journey from refugees to citizens as they struggle to make new homes and lives in an unhomely land. Moreover, arguing that the event of Partition radically transformed the notions of home, belonging, self and community, it shows that individuals affected by Partition produce a new ethics and aesthetic of displacement and embody new ways of being in the world. An important contribution to the field of Partition studies, this book will be of interest to researchers on South Asian history, memory, partition and postcolonial studies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780429017360"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0429017367"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 248, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT36&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-sAWiDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Memories_and_Postmemories_of_the_Partiti-sample-epub.acsm?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Memories_and_Postmemories_of_the_Partiti-sample-pdf.acsm?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sAWiDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "These include the <b>biographies</b>, <b>autobiographies</b>, diaries and <b>memoirs</b> of those <br>\nwho witnessed Partition, both colonial officials (Darling 1948; Tuker 1950; <br>\nCampbell Johnson 1951; Moon 1961; Menon 1961; Philips 1962) and <b>Indian</b> <br>\npolitical&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kZWWCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "pnph0YeDPMI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kZWWCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Jackals' Wedding", "subtitle": "A Memoir of a Childhood in British India", "authors": ["Dawn Kawahara"], "publisher": "AuthorHouse", "publishedDate": "2003-01-21", "description": "Jackals Wedding, my story within a family story set in India, the land of my birth, tells of a past of puzzling opposites. \"Tigers, and oil, and tea are all I remember,\" I once blithely answered an Indian professor whod taken me for a whirl. When he stopped dead, held me at arms length and searched my eyes, I had to think twice about the superficial untruth Id blurted. There were many parts of my early life Id locked away in the dark, just like my mother, and my grandmother before her. The good things that surfaced were idealized, airbrushed into scenes worthy of Kipling, or The Little Princess. I knew the romantic version, but what was the truth? What had really happened during those years in India? How had my mother and father became ensnared in a storm and sun relationship, a \"jackals wedding,\" with my sister and me dragged along unwittingly? How had the exigencies of wartime prevented them from dealing with their own blow-ups? What was the big taboo within our family? Why so many secrets locked away, as my mothers heart had seemed locked to me? I was hungry to know the truth, so I began to dig down to the beginning through my first memories that are entwined with the unrest of the times. With a stroke of serendipity, my husband convinced me I must return to India, the land of my birth, and my childhood home in Dehra Dun. During this trip together, time spans were erased. People stepped forward to help. Images and voices and feelings came flooding back, and I was ready to examine them as Id examined the belongings that had traveled half the world in battered leather cases. Brought to light, the joys of my childhood flashed vivid and fragile as glass bangles. Fears that had lurked large as nightmare lions and scary as snakes dissolved like thunderheads shrinking and fading into a quiet sky. In Jackals Wedding, the stories of the child I was and the woman Ive become are braided with my mothers story and the stories she told.

Life among the Scorpions recounts the deeply fascinating and often tumultuous events that mark thirty years of Jaya Jaitly's political journey. From arranging relief for victims of the 1984 Sikh riots, to joining politics under firebrand leader George Fernandes, to becoming the president of Samata Party-a key ally in the erstwhile NDA Government, Jaitly's rise in Indian mainstream politics invited both awe and envy. But the going has been far from smooth. Trouble began with George Fernandes sacking Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat in 1998. Jaitly became the target. She was soon hounded by Tehelka's stings-first concerning her son-in-law-to-be Ajay Jadeja and then herself in an alleged bribery case. Eventually, Fernandes had to resign as India's Defence Minister, despite being the best, and Jaitly quit as the Samata Party President. Meanwhile, she spiritedly fought booth capturing in Bihar as well as fellow party men's egos, intervened and ensured the installation of the Samata government in Manipur. All this, even as she continued her parallel fight for the livelihood of craftsmen on the one hand, and conceptualized and ensured establishment of the first Dilli Haat (crafts market place) in 1994 on the other. With all the backstories of major events in Indian politics between 1970-2000, including her experience of dealing with the Commission of Inquiry and courts regarding the Tehelka stings, the story of Jaya Jaitly makes for a riveting read.

A large number of Indians have committed themselves to the writing of their autobiographies in English as well as in the regional languages. It is exciting to know that those in English have been produced by some of the finest minds of the country, such as Raja Rammohun Roy, Lal Behari Day, Surendra Nath Banerjea, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, P.C. Roy, S. Radhakrishnan, Sachchidanand Sinha and Nirad C. Chaudhury. It is highly fascinating to read their testimony in the shaping of modern Indian history. Even more exciting are the glimpses into their private lives and the interrelation between the portrait and the man. This study is the first comprehensive attempt to critically evaluate these works and shows how in modern times Indians begin to get over the proverbial Indian inhibition in talking of private affairs hesitatingly first and then with a devastating even embarrassing frankness. This study, in passing also tries to dispel the impression that no autobiographical tradition existed in ancient and medieval India.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781481784948"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1481784943"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 258, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 403.56, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 282.49, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&rdid=book-_U4fnGfsZT8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 403560000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 282490000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/THE_INDIAN_AUTOBIOGRAPHIES_IN_ENGLISH-sample-epub.acsm?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/THE_INDIAN_AUTOBIOGRAPHIES_IN_ENGLISH-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_U4fnGfsZT8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This study is the first comprehensive attempt to critically evaluate these works and shows how in modern times Indians begin to get over the proverbial Indian inhibition in talking of private affairs hesitatingly first and then with a ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6WzntwEACAAJ", "etag": "UiOBzsRN3Ro", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6WzntwEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Memories of Madhupur", "subtitle": "Mid-Century Vignettes from East of India", "authors": ["Samarendra Narayan Roy"], "publishedDate": "2018-06-02", "description": "As the world moved from the fifties to the next millennium, so naturally did Bihar, only in a more tumultuous way than most.

Going behind the scenes of The Big Bang Theory and into his personal experiences, Kunal introduces readers to the people who helped him grow, such as his James Bond-loving, mustachioed father.

In these memoirs he retraces his bohemian student years in Santiago; his sojourns as Chilean consul in Burma, Ceylon, and Java, in Spain during the civil war, and in Mexico; and his service as a Chilean senator. Neruda, a Communist, was driven from his senate seat in 1948, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. After a year in hiding, he escaped on horseback over the Andes and then to Europe; his travels took him to Russia, Eastern Europe, and China before he was finally able to return home in 1952. The final section of the memoirs was written after the coup in 1972 that overthrew Neruda's friend Salvador Allende. Many of the century's most important literary and artistic figures were Neruda's friends, and figure in his memoirs--Garcia Lorca, Aragon, Picasso, and Rivera, among them--and also such political leaders as Gandhi, Nehru, Mao, Castro, and Che Guevara. In his uniquely expressive prose, Neruda not only explains his views on poetry and describes the circumstances that inspired many of his poems, but he creates a revealing record of his life as a poet, a patriot, and one of the twentieth century's true men of conscience.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0374527539"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780374527532"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ekOZnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ekOZnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ekOZnQEACAAJ&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ekOZnQEACAAJ&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Memoirs.html?hl=&id=ekOZnQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ekOZnQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In these memoirs he retraces his bohemian student years in Santiago; his sojourns as Chilean consul in Burma, Ceylon, and Java, in Spain during the civil war, and in Mexico; and his service as a Chilean senator."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "snIXFwzRJDUC", "etag": "wc96ril8H9g", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/snIXFwzRJDUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Play It Again", "subtitle": "An Amateur Against The Impossible", "authors": ["Alan Rusbridger"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2013-01-17", "description": "In 2010, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, set himself an almost impossible task: to learn, in the space of a year, Chopin\u2019s Ballade No. 1 \u2013 a piece that inspires dread in many professional pianists.

My strengths and weaknesses, my successes and failures. Every individual lives a uniquely different life. Life stories are always interesting. No one leads an uneventful life. Having been a sportsman, I also want young, aspiring sportsmen to learn from my career. Like a father once said to his son: 'I made twenty mistakes in my life, you'll make twenty new ones.' In Imperfect, Sanjay Manjrekar uses his famous analytical powers to look back on his own career as a cricketer. His photographic memory takes the reader along on his journey from the dusty maidans of Mumbai to the world stage as the combative batsman faces up to the fearsome West Indian and Pakistani pace attacks. In his precise plainspeak, Sanjay reflects on his father Vijay Manjrekar and the effects of his personality on his game. He comments on the complex equations with the India greats with whom he shared the dressing room, and on the lessons learnt from his opponents. He also reveals his own excruciating obsession with batting technique, the quest for perfection, and the battle to shake off his mental shackles. Imperfect sets a new standard for cricket writing in India, with significant life lessons even for those who aren't cricket fans.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier":

Yet beyond such debate, what has not been fully understood is her life-long communion with nature and how that defined her very being. Weaving personal, political and environmental history, politician-scholar Jairam Ramesh narrates the compelling story of Indira Gandhi, the naturalist. He tells us why and how she came to make a private passion a public calling; how her views on the environment remained steadfast even as her political and economic stances changed; how her friendships with conservationists led to far-reaching decisions to preserve India\u2019s biodiversity; how she urged, cajoled and persuaded her colleagues as she took significant decisions particularly regarding forests and wildlife; and how her own finely-developed instincts and beliefs resulted in landmark policies, programmes, initiatives, laws and institutions, that have endured. Drawing extensively from unpublished letters, notes, messages and memos, Indira Gandhi: A Life in Nature offers a lively, conversational narrative of a relatively little known but fascinating aspect of Indira Gandhi\u2019s tumultuous life. Equally, the book acts as a compass to India at a time when the country faces the formidable challenge of ensuring ecological security and sustainability in its pursuit of high economic growth.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9788193355251"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "8193355253"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=44&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 588.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 370.96, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-wOYlDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 588820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 370960000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Indira_Gandhi-sample-epub.acsm?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wOYlDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Indira Gandhi, prime minister of India for sixteen years, was as charismatic as she was controversial\u2014both admired and criticized for her political judgments and actions."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kuY1glf2n0YC", "etag": "syRdM90wW9Q", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kuY1glf2n0YC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Our Moon Has Blood Clots", "subtitle": "A Memoir of a Lost Home in Kashmir", "authors": ["Rahul Pandita"], "publisher": "Random House India", "publishedDate": "2017-10-29", "description": "Rahul Pandita was fourteen years old when he was forced to leave his home in Srinagar along with his family.

Accounts of his eventful and stormy life have oscillated from eulogizing hagiographies to disparaging demonization. The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between and has unfortunately never been brought to light. Savarkar and his ideology stood as one of the strongest and most virulent opponents of Gandhi, his pacifist philosophy and the Indian National Congress. An alleged atheist and a staunch rationalist who opposed orthodox Hindu beliefs, encouraged inter-caste marriage and dining, and dismissed cow worship as mere superstition, Savarkar was, arguably, the most vocal political voice for the Hindu community through the entire course of India's freedom struggle. From the heady days of revolution and generating international support for the cause of India's freedom as a law student in London, Savarkar found himself arrested, unfairly tried for sedition, transported and incarcerated at the Cellular Jail, in the Andamans, for over a decade, where he underwent unimaginable torture. From being an optimistic advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity in his treatise on the 1857 War of Independence, what was it that transformed him in the Cellular Jail to a proponent of 'Hindutva', which viewed Muslims with suspicion? Drawing from a vast range of original archival documents across India and abroad, this biography in two parts-the first focusing on the years leading up to his incarceration and eventual release from the Kalapani-puts Savarkar, his life and philosophy in a new perspective and looks at the man with all his achievements and failings.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789353056148"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9353056144"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 624, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 897.98, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 484.91, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-E46nDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 897980000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 484910000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Savarkar-sample-epub.acsm?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Savarkar-sample-pdf.acsm?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Savarkar and his ideology stood as one of the strongest and most virulent opponents of Gandhi, his pacifist philosophy and the Indian National Congress."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LSrDDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "tUJi0rXpiiA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LSrDDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Autobiography of an Indian Princess", "authors": ["Maharani of Cooch Behar Sunity Devee"], "publisher": "Good Press", "publishedDate": "2019-12-06", "description": "\"The Autobiography of an Indian Princess\" by Maharani of Cooch Behar Sunity Devee.

Clive of India was one of the most extraordinary and colorful figures Britain ever produced. The founder of Britain's Indian empire, he was also Britain's first great guerrilla fighter by the age of twenty-seven, conqueror of Bengal at thirty-one, and avenging angel of righteousness against the greed of his own fellow-countrymen at forty-one. In his later life Parliament brought him under painful scrutiny and he ended up one of the most hated men in Britain. He died violently under still-mysterious circumstances just before his fiftieth birthday. The story of Clive can be viewed on several levels: as a spirited military adventure by a man who defied death many times, who withstood the greatest siege in British military history, and conspired to force one of the most absolute and cruellest monarchs on earth off his throne; as the morality tale of a penniless young man who became the sole ruler of a huge empire, ended up as one of the richest men in Britain and was then brought to account and driven to despair; or as the story of a plundering early poacher-turned-gamekeeper who sought to establish a moral and legal order amidst slaughter and greed. Clive today lies buried in an unknown grave in an obscure corner of rural Shropshire, a reflection of the controversy he aroused in his lifetime and that still surrounds his legacy and the manner of his death. In this lively and revealing study Robert Harvey illuminates Clive's life's journey from the green fields surrounding Market Drayton through his adventures in India, his drive to success and self-destruction, to his vicious and premature death, by suicide or murder.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781466878624"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1466878622"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 2, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=StHrAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=StHrAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=StHrAwAAQBAJ&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=StHrAwAAQBAJ&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Clive.html?hl=&id=StHrAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=StHrAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The real-life story of Robert Clive would be judged as wildly implausible if it came from the pen of a novelist.

Varoufakis sparked one of the most spectacular and controversial battles in recent political history with his attempt to renegotiate Greece\u2019s relationship with the European Union. Yet despite the mass support of the Greek people, and simple logic of his arguments, he succeeded only in provoking the fury of Europe\u2019s political, financial and media elite. Exposing the real business taking place behind the EU\u2019s closed doors, Varoufakis reveals all in this fearless, personal account. Adults In The Room is an extraordinary tale of brinkmanship, hypocrisy, collusion and betrayal that will shake the European and economic establishment to its foundations.

Triggered off by a heart attack at thirty-eight, Ravi Kailas's search takes us through the challenging, yet ultimately rewarding process of shedding the self to discover service. His story is set against the backdrop of inspirations that are deep and varied: from Vipassana meditation to Alexander the Great, from Ashoka to Chuck Feeney, from the pioneers of trusteeship like Jamsetji Tata to a deep analysis of the relevance of trusteeship to modern-day inequality across the globe. Myth of the Entrepreneur is an intimate exploration of Kailas's journey to understand what constitutes true value, and how each of us can interrogate this concept of 'value' to lead more fruitful, connected and liberated lives.

Rising from tragedy and suffering, Reshma soon made global headlines by becoming the first acid-attack survivor to walk the runway at the New York Fashion Week. Now an international anti-acid-sale activist, vlogger, model, and the face of Make Love Not Scars, Reshma works tirelessly towards empowering other acid-attack survivors like herself and has become a beacon of hope for millions. Inspiring and life-affirming, Being Reshma is the extraordinary story of this young girl from the slums of Mumbai, who overcame insurmountable odds in an unjust world and dared to change it.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781529020090"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1529020093"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 673.17, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 336.58, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qmR2DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 673170000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 336580000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Being_Reshma-sample-epub.acsm?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qmR2DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Inspiring and life-affirming, Being Reshma is the extraordinary story of this young girl from the slums of Mumbai, who overcame insurmountable odds in an unjust world and dared to change it."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "dJZznAEACAAJ", "etag": "7MqCIKqWX3k", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dJZznAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Habib Tanvir", "subtitle": "Memoirs", "authors": ["Hab\u012bba Tanav\u012bra", "Mahmood Farooqui"], "publisher": "Penguin Books", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01", "description": "As the man who brought the popular and the demotic into modern Indian theatre, Habib Tanvir is one of Asia's most important and gifted theatre directors.

Determined to never see this instance repeated, Phogat decided to do the unthinkable. Much to his neighbours\u2019 curiosity, he spent two days digging a pit in his courtyard and asked his young daughters and nieces to join him there at the break of dawn one day. Little did they know that this unusual command from their father would change their lives forever. Yet, each of their wins in the ring, every ambition he had for them, came at great personal cost. In the small village of Balali in Haryana, a state infamous for its practice of female foeticide and low literacy rates, Phogat had to battle not just deep social stigma and an apathetic government but also a disapproving family and personal tragedy to train the girls in his sport.

They cover a wide range of literary responses and genres: eighteenth-century drama, the gothic novel, verse, autobiography, history, religious writing, journalism, women's memoirs, travel writing, popular fiction, and the modernist novel. Brought together in one volume, these essays offer a small, but representative sample of the multifaceted literary and cultural traffic between Britain and India in the colonial period.

He remembers foods served at the Menominee fair and the excitement of \"sugar bush,\" maple sugar gatherings that included dances as well as hard work. Weso uses humor to tell his own story as a boy learning to thrive in a land of icy winters and summer swamps.

Few actors in Hindi cinema have had this sort of a career arc: from the gawky adolescent pining for his schoolteacher (Mera Naam Joker, 1970) to the naughty ninety-year-old (Kapoor & Sons, 2016), Rishi Kapoor has regaled audiences for close to fifty years. He won a National Award for his debut, became an overnight sensation with his first film as a leading man (Bobby, 1973), and carved a niche for himself with a string of romantic musical blockbusters in an era known for its angst-ridden films. He was the youth icon that is still the toast of the satellite TV circuit. The songs he lip-synced are the bread and butter of all radio stations even today. Then there was the second coming after a brief hiatus in the 1990s - as one of the finest actors in mainstream Hindi cinema with powerhouse performances in films like Do Dooni Chaar, D-Day, Agneepath and others. Characteristically candid, Rishi Kapoor brings Punjabi brio to the writing of Khullam Khulla. This is as up close and personal a biography as any fan could have hoped for. He writes about growing up in the shadow of a legendary father, skipping school to act in Mera Naam Joker, the workings of the musical hits of the era, an encounter with Dawood Ibrahim, his heroines (their working relationship, the gossip and the frisson that was sometimes real), his approach to his craft, his tryst with clinical depression, and more.

Instead, he returned to his great-grandfather's estate in Lebanon, a house that, over three years earlier, Shadid had begun to rebuild. House of Stone is the story of a battle-scarred home and a war correspondent's jostled spirit, and of how reconstructing the one came to fortify the other. Shadid creates a mosaic of past and present, tracing the house's renewal alongside his family's flight from Lebanon and resettlement in America.

KJo, as he is popularly called, has been a much-loved Bollywood film director, producer, actor, and discoverer of new talent. With his flagship Dharma Production, he has constantly challenged the norms, written and rewritten rules, and set trends. But who is the man behind the icon that we all know? Baring all for the first time in his autobiography, An Unsuitable Boy, KJo reminisces about his childhood, the influence of his Sindhi mother and Punjabi father, obsession with Bollywood, foray into films, friendships with Aditya Chopra, SRK and Kajol, his love life, the AIB Roast, and much more. In his trademark frank style, he talks about the ever-changing face of Indian cinema, challenges and learnings, as well as friendships and rivalries in the industry. Honest, heart-warming and insightful, An Unsuitable Boy is both the story of the life of an exceptional film-maker at the peak of his powers and of an equally extraordinary human being who shows you how to survive and succeed in life.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789385990939"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9385990934"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.15.14.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 299.72, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 143.87, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-tNbeDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 299720000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 143870000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Unsuitable_Boy-sample-epub.acsm?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Unsuitable_Boy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tNbeDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Honest, heart-warming and insightful, An Unsuitable Boy is both the story of the life of an exceptional film-maker at the peak of his powers and of an equally extraordinary human being who shows you how to survive and succeed in life."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ne4wAQAAIAAJ", "etag": "6dfNVmWQrOk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ne4wAQAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Irregular Serials & Annuals", "subtitle": "An International Directory", "publishedDate": "1986", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "STANFORD:36105117188727"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Periodicals"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ne4wAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ne4wAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ne4wAQAAIAAJ&q=Indian+biographies+memoirs&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ne4wAQAAIAAJ&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Irregular_Serials_Annuals.html?hl=&id=ne4wAQAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ne4wAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Indian</b> National Science Academy , 1 Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg , New Delhi <br>\n110002 , <b>India</b> . bibl . ... <b>Biographical Memoirs</b> of Fellows ( ISSN 0547 -

James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa\u2014'Most excellent among Women'\u2014the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her\u2014not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company. It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant. In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781101098127"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1101098120"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 512, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 13, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&pg=PT99&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 726.81, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 363.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&rdid=book-Xhr2aR-O7c0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 726810000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 363400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/White_Mughals-sample-epub.acsm?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Xhr2aR-O7c0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Love and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century <b>India</b> William Dalrymple. 104 <br>\ncompletely removed from it, while <b>biographies</b> and <b>memoirs</b> of prominent <br>\neighteenth-century British <b>Indian</b> worthies which mentioned their <b>Indian</b> wives <br>\nwere re-edited in&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TIKuDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "uTv8xeuZkx0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TIKuDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "I Am a Stranger Here Myself: An Unreliable Memoir", "authors": ["Bhaichand Patel"], "publisher": "HarperCollins", "publishedDate": "2019-10-31", "description": "From modest beginnings in Fiji, a dot in the Pacific Ocean, to the dining tables of queens and prime ministers, Bhaichand Patel's journey shows him to be the quintessential self-made man.

If for any reason at all he fails, virtually the entire public sector will have to be written off for the next twenty years,' noted the panel that chose V. Krishnamurthy as the Business India Businessman of the Year in 1987. Management of a business enterprise in India is more difficult than in other countries. There are far more uncertainties that an Indian manager has to encounter while performing his tasks-even more so in state-owned companies than in private ones. But Krishnamurthy, through his exemplary stewardship of three major enterprises, changed the rules of the game in the 1970s and 1980s. At Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, he saved the company from imminent disintegration and dispelled Indira Gandhi's impression that Indian managers did not have the ability to manage large organizations. At Maruti, he was given the responsibility of not just manufacturing a car but of modernizing the automobile industry itself. Steel Authority of India Limited was almost a sunset company when he took over, but he shook up the organization from its very foundations and put it back in a leadership position.

This volume presents a range of papers examining the Indian Army experience from the outbreak of world war in 1939 to the partition of India in 1947. With contributions from many of those at the forefront of the study of the Indian Army and Commonwealth history, the book focuses upon a period of Indian Army history not well covered by modern scholarship. As such it makes a substantial contribution across a range of subject areas, presenting a compendium of chapters examining Indian Army participation in the Second World War from North Africa to Burma, plus a variety of other topics including the evolution of wartime training, frontier operations, Churchill and the Indian Army, the Army's role in the development of post-war British counterinsurgency practice, and of particular note, several chapters examining aspects of the partition in 1947. As such, the book offers a fascinating insight into one of the most important yet least understood military forces of the twentieth century. It will be of interest not only to those seeking a fuller understanding of past campaigns, but also to those wishing to better understand the development and ethos of the present day military forces of the Indian subcontinent.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781409456537"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1409456536"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w3BmOH-sac8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w3BmOH-sac8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w3BmOH-sac8C&pg=PT65&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w3BmOH-sac8C&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indian_Army_1939_47.html?hl=&id=w3BmOH-sac8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Indian_Army_1939_47-sample-epub.acsm?id=w3BmOH-sac8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Indian_Army_1939_47-sample-pdf.acsm?id=w3BmOH-sac8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=w3BmOH-sac8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "1 an impression reinforced by Churchill&#39;s own <b>memoirs</b> anda numberof <br>\nquasihagiographic <b>biographies</b>.

His amazing story has now been turned into a major film, A Billion Dreams, in which he stars. The greatest run-scorer in the history of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013 after an astonishing 24 years at the top. The most celebrated Indian cricketer of all time, he received the Bharat Ratna Award - India's highest civilian honour - on the day of his retirement. Now Sachin Tendulkar tells his own remarkable story - from his first Test cap at the age of 16 to his 100th international century and the emotional final farewell that brought his country to a standstill. When a boisterous Mumbai youngster's excess energies were channelled into cricket, the result was record-breaking schoolboy batting exploits that launched the career of a cricketing phenomenon. Before long Sachin Tendulkar was the cornerstone of India's batting line-up, his every move watched by a cricket-mad nation's devoted followers. Never has a cricketer been burdened with so many expectations; never has a cricketer performed at such a high level for so long and with such style - scoring more runs and making more centuries than any other player, in both Tests and one-day games. And perhaps only one cricketer could have brought together a shocked nation by defiantly scoring a Test century shortly after terrorist attacks rocked Mumbai. His many achievements with India include winning the World Cup and topping the world Test rankings. Yet he has also known his fair share of frustration and failure - from injuries and early World Cup exits to stinging criticism from the press, especially during his unhappy tenure as captain.

With little money or support, he struggled to survive there. Two years later, he was earning an annual income of $250,000; by the age of twenty-six, he was a multimillionaire. Yet, worldly success was merely a way station on a journey that began years ago. As an eight-year-old, he saw a vision of God in a dream, an experience that left him with a sense of deep joy and peace. The dream triggered off his desire to meet God, to see a manifestation of the Divine. He practiced astrology, intense meditation and tantra, yet God was nowhere in sight. Deeply frustrated, he dived into materialistic pursuits to distract himself from the restlessness within. After years of living the good life, he found he could no longer ignore the old restlessness; worldly pleasures just couldn't fill the void within. He moved back to India and finally did what he had always yearned to do: renounce the world and become a monk. In the Himalayas, in terrifying silence and solitude, Om Swami practised intense meditation. Death was always close as he confronted starvation, the fierce elements and wild animals. Finally, his sadhana brought him to the ultimate realization: I am what I have been seeking. This is an astounding memoir of the making of a spiritual life in today's challenging and often confusing times.

Social Services soon intervened and at the age of 13 and he was placed in a children's home. Whilst places like children's homes are created for the protection of children it seems as though they can often be a breeding ground for the abuse and manipulation of children. His experience with a number of institutions that were put in place to prevent the harm of children has proved that there is a blatant betrayal of trust by those put in a position of authority. The lack of moral backbone that such systems employed left him and a number of other children confused about authority and the law - a defective trait that led to misguided criminal activity during our youths. His never dying determination and love for his wife made him turn the things around.

By comparing memoirs representing states that share similar demographic, ecological, and socio-economic characteristics, this historic and literary analysis reveals both commonalities and divergences among American Western memoirs. Each chapter compares two books of similar thematic concerns, ranging from regional values and rural evolution to dynamic landscapes and the experiences of American Indians.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780786451630"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0786451637"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 219, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&pg=PA124&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eNez1vVa2DcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2113.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2113.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&rdid=book-eNez1vVa2DcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2113090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2113090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Rockies_in_First_Person-sample-epub.acsm?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Rockies_in_First_Person-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eNez1vVa2DcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Indian</b>.

"Yellow Woman", "authors": ["Leslie Marmon Silko"], "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "publishedDate": "1993", "description": "In the past twenty-five years many Native American writers have retold the traditional stories of powerful mythological women: Corn Woman, Changing Woman, Serpent Woman, and Thought Woman, who with her sisters created all life by thinking it into being. Within and in response to these evolving traditions, Leslie Marmon Silko takes from her own tradition, the Keres of Laguna, the Yellow Woman. Yellow Woman stories, always female-centered and always from the Yellow Woman's point of view, portray a figure who is adventurous, strong, and often alienated from her own people. She is the spirit of woman. Ambiguous and unsettling, Silko's \"Yellow Woman\" explores one woman's desires and changes--her need to open herself to a richer sensuality. Walking away from her everyday identity as daughter, wife and mother, she takes possession of transgressive feelings and desires by recognizing them in the stories she has heard, by blurring the boundaries between herself and the Yellow Woman of myth. Silko's decision to tell the story from the narrator's point of view is traditional, but her use of first person narration and the story's much raised ambiguity brilliantly reinforce her themes. Like traditional yellow women, the narrator is unnamed. By choosing not to reveal her name, she claims the role of Yellow Woman, and Yellow Woman's story is the one Silko clearly claims as her own. The essays in this collection compare Silko's many retellings of Yellow Woman stories from a variety of angles, looking at crucial themes like storytelling, cultural inheritances, memory, continuity, identity, interconnectedness, ritual, and tradition. This casebook includes an introduction by the editor, a chronology, an authoritative text of the story itself, critical essays, and a bibliography for further reading in both primary and secondary sources. Contributors include Kim Barnes, A. LaVonne Ruoff, Paula Gunn Allen, Patricia Clark Smith, Bernard A.

Dilip Kumar (born as Yousuf Khan), who began as a diffident novice in Hindi cinema in the early 1940s, went on to attain the pinnacle of stardom within a short time. He came up with spellbinding performances in one hit film after another \u2013 in his almost six-decade-long career \u2013 on the basis of his innovative capability, determination, hard work and never-say-die attitude. In this unique volume, Dilip Kumar traces his journey right from his birth to the present. In the process, he candidly recounts his interactions and relationships with a wide variety of people not only from his family and the film fraternity but also from other walks of life, including politicians. While seeking to set the record straight, as he feels that a lot of what has been written about him so far is \u2018full of distortions and misinformation\u2019, he narrates, in graphic detail, how he got married to Saira Banu, which reads like a fairy tale! Dilip Kumar relates, matter-of-factly, the event that changed his life: his meeting with Devika Rani, the boss of Bombay Talkies, when she offered him an acting job. His first film was Jwar Bhata (1944). He details how he had to learn everything from scratch and how he had to develop his own distinct histrionics and style, which would set him apart from his contemporaries. After that, he soon soared to great heights with movies such as Jugnu, Shaheed, Mela, Andaz, Deedar, Daag and Devdas. In these movies he played the tragedian with such intensity that his psyche was adversely affected. He consulted a British psychiatrist, who advised him to switch over to comedy. The result was spectacular performances in laugh riots such as Azaad and Kohinoor, apart from a scintillating portrayal as a gritty tonga driver in Naya Daur. After a five-year break he started his \u2018second innings\u2019 with Kranti (1981), after which he appeared in a series of hits such as Vidhaata, Shakti, Mashaal, Karma, Saudagar and Qila.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789381398968"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9381398968"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 462, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 2, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1321.18, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 660.59, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-J2UZBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1321180000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 660590000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dilip_Kumar-sample-epub.acsm?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dilip_Kumar-sample-pdf.acsm?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=J2UZBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In this unique volume, Dilip Kumar traces his journey right from his birth to the present."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sE4tLgEACAAJ", "etag": "VWRRcA2/h4k", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sE4tLgEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Bad Indians", "subtitle": "A Tribal Memoir", "authors": ["Deborah A.

a unique, comprehensive, and authoritative guide to the oral and written literatures of Native Americans. It lays the perfect foundation for understanding the works of Native American writers. Divided into three major sections, Native American Oral Literatures, The Historical Emergence of Native American Writing, and A Native American Renaissance: 1967 to the Present, it includes 22 lengthy essays, written by scholars of the Association for the Study of American Indian Literatures. The book features reports on the oral traditions of various tribes and topics such as the relation of the Bible, dreams, oratory, humor, autobiography, and federal land policies to Native American literature. Eight additional essays cover teaching Native American literature, new fiction, new theater, and other important topics, and there are bio-critical essays on more than 40 writers ranging from William Apes (who in the early 19th century denounced white society's treatment of his people) to contemporary poet Ray Young Bear. Packed with information that was once scattered and scarce, the Handbook of Native American Literature -a valuable one-volume resource-is sure to appeal to everyone interested in Native American history, culture, and literature.

I find that her act of weaving and my act of writing are organically linked. The weave is similar. It is the weave of pain, suffering, and agony that links us.\" Activist and award-winning writer Urmila Pawar recounts three generations of Dalit women who struggled to overcome the burden of their caste. Dalits, or untouchables, make up India's poorest class. Forbidden from performing anything but the most undesirable and unsanitary duties, for years Dalits were believed to be racially inferior and polluted by nature and were therefore forced to live in isolated communities. Pawar grew up on the rugged Konkan coast, near Mumbai, where the Mahar Dalits were housed in the center of the village so the upper castes could summon them at any time. As Pawar writes, \"the community grew up with a sense of perpetual insecurity, fearing that they could be attacked from all four sides in times of conflict. That is why there has always been a tendency in our people to shrink within ourselves like a tortoise and proceed at a snail's pace.\" Pawar eventually left Konkan for Mumbai, where she fought for Dalit rights and became a major figure in the Dalit literary movement. Though she writes in Marathi, she has found fame in all of India. In this frank and intimate memoir, Pawar not only shares her tireless effort to surmount hideous personal tragedy but also conveys the excitement of an awakening consciousness during a time of profound political and social change.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231520577"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231520573"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.9.9.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y4TAzsQNgJkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y4TAzsQNgJkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=y4TAzsQNgJkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=111&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=y4TAzsQNgJkC&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Weave_of_My_Life.html?hl=&id=y4TAzsQNgJkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Weave_of_My_Life-sample-epub.acsm?id=y4TAzsQNgJkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Weave_of_My_Life-sample-pdf.acsm?id=y4TAzsQNgJkC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=y4TAzsQNgJkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The weave is similar.

Today he is widely recognized as a founder and shaper of twentieth-century Native American literature. Twenty Thousand Mornings is Mathews\u2019s intimate chronicle of his formative years. Written in 1965-67 but only recently discovered, this work captures Osage life in pre-statehood Oklahoma and recounts many remarkable events in early-twentieth-century history. Born in Pawhuska, Osage Nation, Mathews was the only surviving son of a mixed-blood Osage father and a French-American mother. Within these pages he lovingly depicts his close relationships with family members and friends. Yet always drawn to solitude and the natural world, he wanders the Osage Hills in search of tranquil swimming holes\u2014and new adventures. Overturning misguided critical attempts to confine Mathews to either Indian or white identity, Twenty Thousand Mornings shows him as a young man of his time. He goes to dances and movies, attends the brand-new University of Oklahoma, and joins the Air Service as a flight instructor during World War I\u2014spawning a lifelong fascination with aviation. His accounts of wartime experiences include unforgettable descriptions of his first solo flight and growing skill in night-flying. Eventually Mathews gives up piloting to become a student again, this time at Oxford University, where he begins to mature as an intellectual. In her insightful introduction and explanatory notes, Susan Kalter places Mathews\u2019s work in the context of his life and career as a novelist, historian, naturalist, and scholar. Kalter draws on his unpublished diaries, revealing aspects of his personal life that have previously been misunderstood. In addressing the significance of this posthumous work, she posits that Twenty Thousand Mornings will challenge, defy, and perhaps redefine studies of American Indian autobiography.\u201d", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780806187488"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0806187484"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 360, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.7.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indian+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=113&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mply7iUmAXEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1940.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1940.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&rdid=book-Mply7iUmAXEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1940090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1940090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Twenty_Thousand_Mornings-sample-epub.acsm?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Twenty_Thousand_Mornings-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Mply7iUmAXEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In addressing the significance of this posthumous work, she posits that Twenty Thousand Mornings will challenge, defy, and perhaps redefine studies of American Indian autobiography.\u201d"}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2HAgDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "EjixqQLJMeQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2HAgDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Autobiography", "authors": ["Jawaharlal Nehru"], "publisher": "Penguin UK", "publishedDate": "2004-05-07", "description": "Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, was a great personality who also wrote a number of inspiring and knowledgeable books.
