Today, certification relies as much on evaluation of the software development process as it does on the system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s properties. While the latter are preferable, the complexity of these systems usually makes them extremely difficult to evaluate. To explore these and related issues, the National Coordination Office for Information technology Research and Development asked the NRC to undertake a study to assess the current state of certification in dependable systems. The study is in two phases: the first to frame the problem and the second to assess it. This report presents a summary of a workshop held as part of the first phase.

In Digital Archaeology, expert practitioner Michael Graves has written the most thorough, realistic, and up-to-date guide to the principles and techniques of modern digital forensics. Graves begins by providing a solid understanding of the legal underpinnings of and critical laws affecting computer forensics, including key principles of evidence and case law. Next, he explains how to systematically and thoroughly investigate computer systems to unearth crimes or other misbehavior, and back it up with evidence that will stand up in court. Drawing on the analogy of archaeological research, Graves explains each key tool and method investigators use to reliably uncover hidden information in digital systems. His detailed demonstrations often include the actual syntax of command-line utilities. Along the way, he presents exclusive coverage of facilities management, a full chapter on the crucial topic of first response to a digital crime scene, and up-to-the-minute coverage of investigating evidence in the cloud. Graves concludes by presenting coverage of important professional and business issues associated with building a career in digital forensics, including current licensing and certification requirements. Topics Covered Include Acquiring and analyzing data in ways consistent with forensic procedure Recovering and examining e-mail, Web, and networking activity Investigating users\u2019 behavior on mobile devices Overcoming anti-forensics measures that seek to prevent data capture and analysis Performing comprehensive electronic discovery in connection with lawsuits Effectively managing cases and documenting the evidence you find Planning and building your career in digital forensics Digital Archaeology is a key resource for anyone preparing for a career as a professional investigator; for IT professionals who are sometimes called upon to assist in investigations; and for those seeking an explanation of the processes involved in preparing an effective defense, including how to avoid the legally indefensible destruction of digital evidence.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780132853798"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0132853795"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 600, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PR18&dq=Certification+computers+technology&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3480.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3480.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BYNuAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3480740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3480740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Microsoft <b>Certified</b> Systems Engineer (MCSE): Microsoft <b>certification</b> of <br>\nprofessional excellence in managing Microsoft ... <b>certification</b> of expertise in <br>\n<b>computer</b> hardware instal- lation and maintenance offered by the <b>Computing</b> <br>\n<b>Technology</b>&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WKoZBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "f4DA2SrpNiw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WKoZBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lab Manual for Andrews' A+ Guide to Hardware, 6th", "authors": ["Jean Andrews"], "publisher": "Cengage Learning", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01", "description": "The Lab Manual is a valuable tool designed to enhance your lab experience.

Reflecting recent updates to the Certified Authorization Professional (CAP\u00ae) Common Body of Knowledge (CBK\u00ae) and NIST SP 800-37, the Official (ISC)2\u00ae Guide to the CAP\u00ae CBK\u00ae, Second Edition provides readers with the tools to effectively secure their IT systems via standard, repeatable processes. Derived from the author\u2019s decades of experience, including time as the CISO for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the National Science Foundation\u2019s Antarctic Support Contract, the book describes what it takes to build a system security authorization program at the organizational level in both public and private organizations. It analyzes the full range of system security authorization (formerly C&A) processes and explains how they interrelate. Outlining a user-friendly approach for top-down implementation of IT security, the book: Details an approach that simplifies the authorization process, yet still satisfies current federal government criteria Explains how to combine disparate processes into a unified risk management methodology Covers all the topics included in the Certified Authorization Professional (CAP\u00ae) Common Body of Knowledge (CBK\u00ae) Examines U.S. federal polices, including DITSCAP, NIACAP, CNSS, NIAP, DoD 8500.1 and 8500.2, and NIST FIPS Reviews the tasks involved in certifying and accrediting U.S. government information systems Chapters 1 through 7 describe each of the domains of the (ISC)2\u00ae CAP\u00ae CBK\u00ae.

These applications included those that focus on human performance and the adequacy of human performance; in these contexts, raters were asked to focus on the knowledge and skills that underlie competent performance. Researchers also examined applications that focus on the impact of environmental agents on life and the ecology; in these cases, raters began with the knowledge that more (or less) of a substance is better and, as for NAEP, the judgment task was to determine \"how good is good enough.\" They wished to examine parallels in the objectives, empirical grounding, judgmental requirements, and policy tensions for standard setting in NAEP and in other domains. These papers were commissioned to examine the current state of affairs and residual issues with respect to achievement-level setting in NAEP and to help determine whether the models and methods used in other disciplines have useful application to education. It is important to note that the papers represent the authors' views, not necessarily those of the committee or National Research Council. This issue and the workshop discussion point out a number of analogies between the objectives, requisite data, judgment requirements and policy issues for NAEP and other applications.

This manual is designed to provide information to help readers study for and pass CompTIA's A+ Core Operating System Technology Certification Exam. Every effort has been made to make this manual as complete and accurate as possible. Just reviewing the table of contents, you will see that through TotalRecall Publications, I was given the freedom to build on what I have learned from running a Voc Tech school. For example, the chapter numbers are written in Base 2. This wasn't done to annoy you. The goal is through reinforcement, learn binary math, since that is how much of computing works. In this release, I teamed up with another alpha geek, and all around \"I want all the data\" person, Tcat Houser. The end result is you will not find another A+ Operating System Technology book with more geekie details, if you need them.

It is also an effective study guide for many radiography courses! Written in outline format, each review of a subject is followed by questions related specifically to that area. Two mock ARRT exams are included in the book, and online exams include a pool of over 1,400 review questions that may be randomly combined to generate a virtually limitless number of mock ARRT exams. From noted radiography educator William J. Callaway, this edition also provides advice on writing resumes and cover letters, interviewing, employer expectations, and continuing education requirements to help you make the transition to a successful career. Review of the five major subject areas covered on the ARRT exam, in an outline format, helps you concentrate on the most important information. Over 2,400 review questions in the book and online offer practice with a multiple-choice format similar to the ARRT exam. Thorough coverage of digital and computed radiography reflects the increased emphasis of these topics on the Registry exam. Online mock exams let you practice in tutorial mode -- with immediate feedback after each question -- or in exam mode, with feedback only after you complete the entire test. Online study tools include study tips for difficult questions and electronic flashcards with formulas, key terms, and important topics. Rationales for correct and incorrect answers are included in the appendix. Career preparation advice includes writing resumes and cover letters, tips for interviewing, a look at what employers expect, career advancement, basic financial planning, and continuing education requirements. Updates reflect the latest ARRT exam changes with expanded coverage of computed and direct radiography, a review of computed tomography along with questions, and an additional 200-question exam in the Review Activities and Challenge Tests chapter. Online access to mock exams. Job search preparation includes tips on how to submit online applications and resumes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780323170284"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0323170285"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 296, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.13.9.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&pg=PA219&dq=Certification+computers+technology&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5413.84, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5413.84, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&rdid=book-zpgzAjjdHVsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5413840000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5413840000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Mosby_s_Comprehensive_Review_of_Radiogra-sample-epub.acsm?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Mosby_s_Comprehensive_Review_of_Radiogra-sample-pdf.acsm?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zpgzAjjdHVsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Because <b>certification</b> requirements and educational programs are subject to <br>\nchange for various reasons, the interested ... anatomy, patient care, nuclear <br>\nphysics and instrumentation, <b>computer technology</b>, biochemistry, <br>\nradiopharmacology,&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "5h3ZF7bOx0kC", "etag": "9dKZgcvYq6s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5h3ZF7bOx0kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Advances in Banking Technology and Management: Impacts of ICT and CRM", "subtitle": "Impacts of ICT and CRM", "authors": ["Ravi, Vadlamani"], "publisher": "IGI Global", "publishedDate": "2007-10-31", "description": "Banking across the world has undergone extensive changes thanks to the profound influence of developments and trends in information communication technologies, business intelligence, and risk management strategies.

It is from both of these perspectives that we approached the preparation of this volume. Our purpose is to provide training professionals in business and industry, and students of human resources development with an overview of current models and issues in educational evaluation. The book is organized around three themes: context, models, and issues. The chapters in the context section are intended to provide the reader with an understanding of the social, organizational, and interpersonal factors that provide background and give meaning to evaluation practice. The models section brings together contributions from some of the most influential thinkers and practitioners in the field. The chapters in this section provide perspective on the dominant themes and emergent trends from individuals who have been, and continue to be, the drivers of those trends. Contributions to the issues section highlight some pervasive themes as well as illuminate new areas of concern and interest that will affect how we assess learning interventions in the organizations of today and tomorrow.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401148504"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401148503"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 390, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA380&dq=Certification+computers+technology&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book--bSvBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Evaluating_Corporate_Training_Models_and-sample-epub.acsm?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Evaluating_Corporate_Training_Models_and-sample-pdf.acsm?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-bSvBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "CD-ROMs, 281 <b>Certification</b>, 337\u2013356 definition of 340, 341t evaluation issues in, <br>\n343\u2013349 (See also <b>Certification</b>, ... 188 <b>Computer</b>-based training, 280, 280t <br>\n<b>Computer</b> literacy, 5 <b>Computer technology</b>, 6 Conceptual models, 44 Conduct,&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "p_dQBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "k0NX8hLhoC8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/p_dQBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Technology Fix", "subtitle": "The Promise and Reality of Computers in Our Schools", "authors": ["William D. Pflaum"], "publisher": "ASCD", "publishedDate": "2004-02-15", "description": "During the technology boom of the 1980s and 1990s, computers seemed set to revolutionize education. Do any of these promises sound familiar? * Technology would help all students learn better, thanks to multimedia programs capable of adapting to individual needs, learning styles, and skill levels. * Technology would transform the teacher's role from a purveyor of a one-size-fits-all curriculum to a facilitator of student exploration. * Technology would replace static textbooks with dynamic, interactive learning resources that were always up-to-date. * Technology would boost test scores, as engaged and motivated students acquired advanced skills, problem-solving abilities, and a growing thirst for knowledge. By 2001, educational materials developer William D. Pflaum had begun to suspect that technology was not the all-purpose solution it had seemed. He decided to see how computers were really being used in U.S. classrooms and embarked on a yearlong road trip to a cross-section of elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the nation. In this book, he recounts his journey. Although he did find technology application to admire, too often he found broken promises: millions spent for little measurable gain, problems instead of solutions, a fix instead of a fix. This inside look at computer use in our schools shares the voices, experiences, triumphs, and frustrations of educators and students in urban, rural, and suburban settings. The author provides insight into the key roles that computers currently play in the classroom and clarifies what we must do ensure that the promise of technology is fulfilled . . . and that students truly benefit.
