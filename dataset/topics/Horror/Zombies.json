They emerge from foggy cemeteries, frozen barrows, loamy bogs, cursed mines, and gore-spattered operating rooms to prey on the living. But these zombies don't just eat people. They help painters and writers save their faltering careers. They unwittingly push humankind on the quest for fire. They topple evil capitalists and their corporate empires. They fight crime.

This currently very influential idea is a threat to all forms of physicalism, and has led some philosophers to give up physicalism and become dualists. It has also beguiled many physicalists, who feel forced to defend increasingly convoluted explanations of why the conceivability of zombies is compatible with their impossibility. Robert Kirk argues that the zombie idea depends on an incoherent view of the nature of phenomenal consciousness. His book has two main aims. One is to demolish the zombie idea once and for all. There are plenty of objections to it in the literature, but they lack intuitive appeal. He offers a striking new argument which reveals fundamental confusions in the implied conception of consciousness. His other main contribution is to develop a fresh and original approach to the true nature of phenomenal consciousness. Kirk argues that a necessary condition is a \"basic package\" of capacities. An important component of his argument is that the necessary cognitive capacities are not as sophisticated as is often assumed. By focusing on humbler creatures than ourselves he avoids some of the distracting complications of our sophisticated forms of cognition. The basic package does not seem to be sufficient for phenomenal consciousness. What is also needed is \"direct activity\"--a special feature of the way the events which constitute incoming perceptual information affect the system. This is an integrated process, to be conceived of holistically, and contrasts sharply with what is often called the \"availability\" or \"poisedness\" of perceptual information. This original, penetrating, and highly readable book will be of interest to all who have a serious concern with the nature of consciousness: not only professional philosophers and students, but also many psychologists and neuroscientists.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199229802"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199229805"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 235, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Zombies_and_Consciousness.html?hl=&id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lRxiGbhKZjUC", "etag": "6ilGDLyJ45M", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lRxiGbhKZjUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Christian Zombie Killers Handbook", "subtitle": "Slaying the Living Dead Within", "authors": ["Jeff Kinley"], "publisher": "Thomas Nelson Inc", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11", "description": "02", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781595554383"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1595554386"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 259, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Religion"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 22, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Christian_Zombie_Killers_Handbook.html?hl=&id=lRxiGbhKZjUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "f4WsZwVm_5EC", "etag": "AtIZxp/M1PQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/f4WsZwVm_5EC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Twilight of the Dead", "authors": ["Travis Adkins", "David Moody"], "publisher": "Permuted Press", "publishedDate": "2006-10-01", "description": "Courtney Colvin was nearing the end of her teenage years when the undead apocalypse began. She survived, forsaking her youth and innocence, and five years later she continues to exist--albeit lonely--in the fortified town of Eastpointe. Nightmares and the unwelcome advances of Leon Wolfe are the worst things she's dealing with now in her otherwise mundane life. But when a newcomer arrives in town and claims to know the location of the antidote to the zombie plague, it sends Eastpointe into an uproar. To retrieve this cure, she and a group of other survivors must venture outside the relative safety of the compound's walls and into a world ruled and dominated by the flesh-eating undead. Twilight of the Dead puts a new spin on the zombie genre, yet remains true to the classic rules that have already been set forth. A sure-fire reading pleasure for anyone who loves character-driven horror.

But slow-witted doesn't stand against the terrible power Granny initiated. Jenkie's experiments only worsen the troubles with Granny's original recipe, bringing dead critters and a few stray folks back to a state of hungry, vicious, mindless animation. Now a stash of the living dead is locked up in the back of the trailer, a howling heard that has Jenkie terrified. And Armistead, one of the red-eyed living dead, seems way too alert for comfort. Mountain resident Kathy Shaw and Hollywood pitchman Jack Carroll, who is looking for the next hit reality show, find themselves caught up in the growing horror surrounding Desper Hollow. They can't avoid it and must face it head on.

The dead walked in the fourteenth century, when the Black Death and other catastrophes roiled Europe. They walked in images from World War I, when a generation died horribly in the trenches. They walked in art inspired by the Holocaust and by the atomic attacks on Japan. Now, in the early twenty-first century, the dead walk in stories of the zombie apocalypse, some of the most ubiquitous narratives of post-9/11 Western culture. Zombies appear in popular movies and television shows, comics and graphic novels, fiction, games, art, and in material culture including pinball machines, zombie runs, and lottery tickets. The zombie apocalypse, Greg Garrett shows us, has become an archetypal narrative for the contemporary world, in part because zombies can stand in for any of a variety of global threats, from terrorism to Ebola, from economic uncertainty to ecological destruction. But this zombie narrative also brings us emotional and spiritual comfort. These apocalyptic stories, in which the world has been turned upside down and protagonists face the prospect of an imminent and grisly death, can also offer us wisdom about living in a community, present us with real-world ethical solutions, and invite us into conversation about the value and costs of survival. We may indeed be living with the living dead these days, but through the stories we consume and the games we play, we are paradoxically learning what it means to be fully alive.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190260453"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190260459"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 228, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Living_with_the_Living_Dead.html?hl=&id=bieeDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HwryB7ssssYC", "etag": "oOR++fj/L3c", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HwryB7ssssYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Dead City", "authors": ["James Ponti"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2012-10-02", "description": "Seventh-grader Molly has always been an outsider, even at New York City's elite Metropolitan Institute of Science and Technology, but that changes when she is recruited to join the Omegas, a secret group that polices and protects zombies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781442441293"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1442441291"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 277, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HwryB7ssssYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HwryB7ssssYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HwryB7ssssYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HwryB7ssssYC&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dead_City.html?hl=&id=HwryB7ssssYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HwryB7ssssYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "eK6BTFofHycC", "etag": "n8/QjcbpPLE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eK6BTFofHycC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Zombielicious", "authors": ["Timothy McGivney"], "publisher": "ManLove Romance Press", "publishedDate": "2010", "description": "Amidst a zombie outbreak, Walt, athletic and confident, meets shy and quiet Joey, the attraction between them both instant and electric.

A few lucky people on Earth have developed a mysterious immunity from the plague. Known as ghosts, they are prized for their ability to walk among the dead and gather food and supplies without fear. The Boston camp harbors one such person, and President Roberts orders the Army\u2019s finest soldier to bring their ghost to Washington, D.C. at any cost. As the world descends into apocalyptic madness, the horde grows increasingly aggressive, threatening the wellbeing of every survivor in Dar\u2019s camp. Boston Common becomes ground zero for a dramatic showdown, and Dar realizes that she must make a decision that threatens not only her life, but the survival of every person she\u2019s been entrusted to protect. Abandoned by her father, Dar has managed to set up a camp in the Boston Common. Surrounded by hordes of ravenous zombies, one person living inside the camp holds the key to their survival.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781618680846"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1618680846"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 528.02, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 528.02, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-QUXZBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 528020000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 528020000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Darpocalypse-sample-epub.acsm?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Darpocalypse-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QUXZBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "g6zkCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "/WpD5F54cDc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/g6zkCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Transatlantic Zombie", "subtitle": "Slavery, Rebellion, and Living Death", "authors": ["Sarah J. Lauro"], "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "publishedDate": "2015-07-15", "description": "Our most modern monster and perhaps our most American, the zombie that is so prevalent in popular culture today has its roots in African soul capture mythologies. The Transatlantic Zombie provides a more complete history of the zombie than has ever been told, explaining how the myth\u2019s migration to the New World was facilitated by the transatlantic slave trade, and reveals the real-world import of storytelling, reminding us of the power of myths and mythmaking, and the high stakes of appropriation and homage. Beginning with an account of a probable ancestor of the zombie found in the Kongolese and Angolan regions of seventeenth-century Africa and ending with a description of the way, in contemporary culture, new media are used to facilitate zombie-themed events, Sarah Juliet Lauro plots the zombie\u2019s cultural significance through Caribbean literature, Haitian folklore, and American literature, film, and the visual arts. The zombie entered US consciousness through the American occupation of Haiti, the site of an eighteenth-century slave rebellion that became a war for independence, thus making the figuration of living death inseparable from its resonances with both slavery and rebellion. Lauro bridges African mythology and US mainstream culture by articulating the ethical complications of the zombie as a cultural conquest that was rebranded for the American cinema. As The Transatlantic Zombie shows, the zombie is not merely a bogeyman representing the ills of modern society, but a battleground over which a cultural war has been fought between the imperial urge to absorb exotic, threatening elements, and the originary, Afro-diasporic culture\u2019s preservation through a strategy of mythic combat.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813568850"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0813568854"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 284, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g6zkCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g6zkCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g6zkCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g6zkCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Transatlantic_Zombie.html?hl=&id=g6zkCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=g6zkCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_iOX0XdpiacC", "etag": "Tvi/o8z6I44", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_iOX0XdpiacC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Art of War for Zombies", "subtitle": "Ancient Secrets of World Domination", "authors": ["Sun Tzumbie", "Madame Cadavre Exquis"], "publisher": "Peter Pauper Press, Inc.", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "They walk among us: The Living.

A fortified city with a high wall, surrounded by lush land rich with all the resources needed to survive, protected by high mountain summits, and a massive gate to secure the only pass into the valley, the Bastion became the last stronghold of the living on earth. But one fateful day, the gate failed and the Inferi Scourge destroyed the human settlements outside the walls and trapped the survivors inside the city. Now decades later, the last remaining humans are struggling to survive in a dying city as resources and hope dwindle.Vanguard Maria Martinez has lived her whole life within the towering walls of steel. She yearns for a life away from the overcrowded streets, rolling blackouts, and food shortages, but there is no hope for anyone as long as the Inferi Scourge howl outside the high walls. Her only refuge from the daily grind is in the arms of her lover, Dwayne Reichardt, an officer in the Bastion Constabulary. Both are highly-decorated veterans of the last disastrous push against the Inferi Scourge. Their secret affair is her only happiness.Then one day Maria is summoned to meet with a mysterious representative from the Science Warfare Division and is offered the opportunity to finally destroy the Inferi Scourge in the valley and close the gate. The rewards of success are great, but she will have to sacrifice everything, possibly even her life, to accomplish the ultimate goal of securing the future of humanity and saving it from extinction.",

Unable to find a moral or sane reason for the horror that surrounds him, he is overwhelmed by violence and insignificance. After wandering for months, Jonah's lonely existence dramatically changes when he discovers a group of survivors. Living in a museum-turned-compound, they are led jointly by Jack, an ever-practical and efficient military man, and Milton, a mysterious, quizzical prophet who holds a strange power over the dead. Both leaders share Jonah's anguish over the brutality of their world, as well as his hope for its beauty. Together with others, they build a community that reestablishes an island of order and humanity surrounded by relentless ghouls. But this newfound peace is short-lived, as Jonah and his band of refugees clash with another group of survivors who remind them that the undead are not the only-nor the most grotesque-horrors they must face.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780978970734"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "097897073X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 9, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.0.2.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oAz4XL8uf2sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oAz4XL8uf2sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oAz4XL8uf2sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oAz4XL8uf2sC&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dying_to_Live.html?hl=&id=oAz4XL8uf2sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dying_to_Live-sample-epub.acsm?id=oAz4XL8uf2sC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oAz4XL8uf2sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZxFaXz8DsZUC", "etag": "BbOr5nDP7lQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZxFaXz8DsZUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Listeners", "authors": ["Harrison Demchick"], "publisher": "Bancroft Press", "publishedDate": "2012", "description": "* Before the plague, and the quarantine, fourteen-year-old Daniel Raymond had only heard of the Listeners. They were a gang, or at least that's what his best friend Katie's police officer father had said. They were criminals, thieves, monsters - deadly men clearly identifiable by the removal of their right ears. That's what Daniel had heard. But he didn't know. He didn't know much in those early days. He didn't know how the plague began, but then, no one did. The doctors and emergency medical personnel said it was airborne, and highly contagious. They said those infected became distorted both inside and out, and very, very dangerous. Then the helicopters came and took the doctors away, and no one said much of anything after that. Except the police officers. They said they'd provide food and order, in exchange for guns and, ultimately, anything else they felt like taking. Daniel's mother went out for toilet paper. She never came back. He hasn't heard from Katie since the phones went dead. And with his real family gone and surrogate family unreachable, Daniel, scared and alone, has nothing except the walls of his apartment, the window shattered, the poisonous air seeping in.That's when the Listeners arrive. Derek, the one-eared man with the big, soulful eyes, promises protection, and hope, and the choice not to sit alone and wait to die in some horrific way. He offers a brotherhood under the watch of their leader, the prophet Adam. He offers a place in the world to come.

The Zombie metaphor may seem extreme, but it is, particularly apt for drawing attention to the ways in which political culture and power in American society now operate on a level of mere survival. This book uses the metaphor not only to suggest the symbolic face of power: beginning and ending with an analysis of authoritarianism, it attempts to mark and chart the visible registers of a kind of zombie politics, including the emergence of right-wing teaching machines, a growing politics of disposability, the emergence of a culture of cruelty, and the ongoing war being waged on young people, especially on youth of color. By drawing attention to zombie politics and authoritarianism, this book aims to break through the poisonous common sense that often masks zombie politicians, anti-public intellectuals, politics, institutions, and social relations, and bring into focus a new language, pedagogy, and politics in n which the living dead will be moved decisively to the margins rather than occupying the very center of politics and everyday life.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1433112264"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781433112263"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 168, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JUuyuBKOgYMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JUuyuBKOgYMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JUuyuBKOgYMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=84&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JUuyuBKOgYMC&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Zombie_Politics_and_Culture_in_the_Age_o.html?hl=&id=JUuyuBKOgYMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JUuyuBKOgYMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "mooUi1oa3AAC", "etag": "5Z50xTBDsSM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mooUi1oa3AAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "My So-called Death", "authors": ["Stacey Jay"], "publisher": "Llewellyn Worldwide", "publishedDate": "2010", "description": "After dying in a cheerleading accident, high school freshman Karen turns into a zombie and enrolls at a boarding school for the undead where she uncovers a murder mystery.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780738715438"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0738715433"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 229, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mooUi1oa3AAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mooUi1oa3AAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mooUi1oa3AAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=85&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mooUi1oa3AAC&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/My_So_called_Death.html?hl=&id=mooUi1oa3AAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/My_So_called_Death-sample-epub.acsm?id=mooUi1oa3AAC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mooUi1oa3AAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "e26lFVGfzEAC", "etag": "BNr1YGfoCyQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/e26lFVGfzEAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Super Zombie Juice Mega Bomb", "authors": ["MJ Ware"], "publisher": "MJA Ware", "publishedDate": "2011-09-18", "description": "When life gives you lemons, kill zombies \u2014 turns out lemon juice neutralizes the undead.After a failed attempt at running away, best friends Nathan and Misty return home expecting to face angry parents.

Then Homeland Security throws her a high-paying, short-term contract even the Zero Dogs can't screw up: destroy a capitalist necromancer bent on dominating the gelatin industry with an all-zombie workforce. The catch? She has to take on Special Forces Captain Jake Sanders, a man who threatens her team, and Andrea's deliberate avoidance of romantic entanglements.

However, controversial plans to build on the site of an old church in South London releases a centuries-old plague that turns its victims into flesh-hungry ghouls whose bite or scratch passes the contagion on to others. Even worse, the virus may also have a supernatural origin with the power to revive the dead. Despite the attempts of the police, the military and those in power to understand and contain the infection commonly referred to as \"The Death\", it soon sweeps across London, transforming everyone who comes into contact with it. With the city - and the country - falling into chaos, even a drastic attempt at a \"Final Solution\" to eradicate the outbreak at its source fails to prevent it from spreading to Europe and then quickly throughout the rest of the world. Soon there is no more news coming out of Britain . . . and it is up to those survivors in other countries to confront the flesh-eating invaders within their midst. Will humanity triumph over a world-wide zombie plague, or will the walking dead ultimately inherit the Earth? Told through various disparate and overlapping eye-witness accounts, through texts, e-mails, blogs, letters, diaries, transcripts, official reports and other forms of communication, a picture builds up of a world plunged into chaos - where the dead attack the living, and only one of them can be the ultimate victor. Written by some of the biggest and best-known names in horror and science fiction, these interconnected narratives create a unique vision of the End of the World brought about by a plague that may have its origins in both science and the occult.

Outbreak - Day1 Like a fragile house of cards in a hurricane, Presidents, Premiers, entire governments and their ruling bodies disappeared instantly. Some had ensconced themselves in deep underground bunkers or remained holed up in fortified strongholds, but history would tell that most had been swallowed up by the dead - never to be heard from again. Infection rates skyrocketed in the United States' largest cities the first days of the outbreak, as the rapacious dead delivered the Omega virus with emotionless efficiency. During the ensuing days, the rest of the country and the world shared the same fate as Omega spread exponentially from within the mega population centers, pulsing into the countryside, a rotten, shambling diaspora. It had taken 3.7 billion years for man to evolve from a universal common ancestor - to stop dragging his collective knuckles - finally to emerge the dominant species, complete with shiny new iPads, Smartphones, worldwide non-stop air travel, and all manner of high tech war machines. Yet it had taken one microscopic manmade virus only three days to deliver mankind, on its collective knees, to the doorstep of extinction. Outbreak - Day 8 After running and gunning across much of the western U.S., Cade Grayson, former Delta Force operator, is finally reunited with his wife Brook and daughter Raven. Hours after arriving at the relative safety of Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, the new Capital of the United States, Cade is approached by the new President, Valerie Clay. Her request is simple: she appeals to the patriot in him to rejoin the Unit that he left for civilian life fifteen months prior and once more go into harm's way, taking the fight to the enemy. Meanwhile, Duncan Winters, Vietnam-era aviator, finds himself stranded in Springs along with BLM firefighter Daymon Bush. Both men arrived with Cade and were promised transport back to Eden, Utah. Duncan longs to be reunited in Eden with his brother Logan, a survivalist/ Doomsday prepper. Daymon, with no surviving family, knows only one thing for certain: he doesn't want to remain trapped behind the wire inside of a huge government-run military base. Mere days after Washington D.C. is overrun and the sitting President goes missing, Robert Christian, billionaire kingmaker who has been waiting in the wings for a world-changing event such as this, marshals his group of mercenaries led by ex-SEAL Ian Bishop. Their mission: to control what remains of the United States by any means necessary and ultimately reshape the country to fit their warped vision for a new world order. Will Cade accept President Clay's overture and embark on a new high priority mission alongside his friend and mentor, Delta Commander General Mike Desantos? Will Brook Grayson continue to hone her newly found survival skills and successfully train her eleven-year-old daughter Raven to defend herself against the undead threat?

Now he's back with Dust Eaters North, an epic, globe-trotting, zombie adventure novel with a twist. \"You aren't lucky enough to die.\" As the dead feed, an ill-equipped, untrained, desperate band of stragglers trudge 1700 miles north to Churchill, Manitoba. Rumors of a cure in China give them hope, but getting there after the world collapsed isn't easy. Dead villages, wild animals, unusual locals, -40 degree wind chill, and a lack of transportation pose obstacles even when Eaters aren't present, but Eaters outnumber the living 600:1. Cray's characters are like you and me, thrust into a world of chaos without any prior training. Cray introduces us to an unlikely band of survivors: Buck, an Oklahoma oil field worker whose last hope depends on climate change Tara, a housewife and former advertising executive thrust into the wilderness when her home explodes Cuba, a reformed gang member and inspiring Big Brother now forced to break a promise not to kill Fifty, a silent mountain of a man who is absolutely terrified of zombies Stokes, an alcoholic music professor still surprised to be alive The Kid, a Russian engineering student and the last survivor of Winnipeg No super-soldiers here. \"That human factor, the one that's often overlooked in the zombie genre, is a welcomed presence here, and adds a level of depth often missing in similar stories.\" - Jess Landry, The Horror Review With nothing in common but their homeless path, these six find ways to bolster and support each other, to give hope in a hopeless world. \"Those hopes become the sweetness that makes the story an adventure rather than an endless forced march through a killing field. The resolution, though horrifying, feels as earned as it is heartbreaking.\" - Publisher's Weekly Just like Red Sand, the horror of the novel is grounded in extensive research. Things happen for a reason; nothing supernatural here. Survivors persist with realistic, practical methods you can learn from. \"If you enjoyed 'The Zombie Survival Guide', you will enjoy reading this.\" - Ben Sanders Ronan Cray researched the book on location in Churchill, Manitoba in the dead of winter. While he didn't encounter any zombies, he did eat moose and dogsled through the taiga. Now back in New York with most of his fingers and toes, he produces short films and documentaries when he isn't writing a sequel. Come along on a journey across continents in Cray's new Compass Series. Hopeful and horrifying, startling and relentless, Dust Eaters will haunt you long after you turn the last page.

Outbreak - Day1 Like a fragile house of cards in a hurricane, Presidents, Premiers, entire governments and their ruling bodies disappeared instantly. Some had ensconced themselves in deep underground bunkers or remained holed up in fortified strongholds, but history would tell that most had been swallowed up by the dead - never to be heard from again. Since that last normal Saturday in July, the Omega virus has indiscriminately delivered destruction and death to all four points of the compass-the latter having recently been visited upon former Delta Force soldier Cade Grayson and the small group of civilian survivors making their home in the subterranean compound near Eden, Utah. In the three weeks since mounting a brash rescue mission to a zombie-infested Los Angeles and returning home to find lives of loved ones hanging in the balance, Cade has occupied himself with runs outside the wire to procure supplies necessary to ride out what the Farmer's Almanac predicts will be a long, cold winter. As Cade and his team seize an unforeseen opportunity provided by the plummeting temperatures, he quickly realizes they are in a race against time-and nature's fickle whims. And as they all labor to make the most of this gift horse, little does he know, even as Old Man Winter covers the valley with the first snow of the season, the infamous Mister Murphy is about to hurl a wicked curveball his way. Because like the fabled butterfly effect-a single action from the past is about to set in motion a chain of events that could at once spell doom for Eden as a sanctuary and scatter the entire group into the wind.

By the time the dead began to walk in Lansing, Michigan, it was already too late to stop the plague. In the heart of the city, a child with cancer and her caretaker risk their lives to help a security guard and a nurse secure an old hospital. As the survivors struggle to stay alive, the grid begins to fail. All the while, the dead fight to get inside. * * * As the world crumbles around them, Keith, Lindsey, Jack and a handful of other hospital employees fight to keep their patients alive. Will they work together and become a community or will it all fall apart as different personalities collide? There is Eric Wapowski, the hospital security guard who is more of a hindrance than a help; Dr. Doune, brain surgeon and sociopath, who has been tasked with the job of researching the plague; and Autumn McAllister, a nine-year-old cancer patient who is old beyond her years. When Snake and his gang of bikers find out about the hospital, will they want it for themselves? As the city is left to burn, will those that stay be able to make a stand against the ever-growing legion of dead closing in on them? Dead, but Not for Long is sometimes dark, but there are moments of levity and a message of hope as well as a few surprises along the way. It is not a book about skilled fighters with state-of-the-art weapons, but ordinary people thrust into the darkest of circumstances. What will they do to stay alive?

Here it is: the prequel to Warm Bodies, released to coincide with the major film adaptation from the producers of Twilight, starring Teresa Palmer and Nicholas Hoult. Julie Grigio drives with her parents through the crumbling wastelands of America - a nightmarish family road trip in search of a new home. A few hundred miles away, Nora Greene finds herself the reluctant, terrified guardian of her younger brother when her parents abandon them in the not-quite-empty ruins of Seattle. In the darkness of a forest, a dead man in a red tie opens his eyes. With no memory of who or what he is, he must unravel the grim mystery of his existence - right after he learns how to think, how to walk, and how to satisfy the monster howling in his belly... Two warped families and a lonely monster. Unknown to any of them, their paths are set to cross in a startling encounter that will change the course of their lives - or deaths - forever.

one of the top indie writers in the business.\" -Joe McKinney, two time Bram Stoker Award winner and best-selling author of the Dead World series. For Cade Grayson, husband, father, and former Delta Force operator, that one warm sunny Saturday in July-later to be labeled Z-Day by some anonymous person probably long dead-began like all the others before, and none since. With his daughter, Raven and wife, Brook, away visiting her parents in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Cade hopes his immediate future holds nothing but an easy chair, Mariners on the tube, and paring down a honey-do list a mile long. But those hopes were quickly dashed and his life forever changed when news broke of a clash in downtown Portland between soldiers from the Oregon National Guard and hundreds of anarchist protesters suddenly turned violent and, by one anchor's account, blood-thirsty and cannibalistic. As the first waves of injured bystanders, Guardsmen, and rioters arrived at hospitals in and around Portland, it became apparent that a deadly new disease had been unleashed on the population. Whether the virus was naturally occurring or an escaped lab experiment Cade hadn't a clue, and he wasn't especially concerned until he learned of its unprecedented virulence, unusual method of transference, and the fact that, according to the talking heads on the news, it brought the newly dead back to life, semi-mindless, and with an insatiable desire to feed on the flesh of the living. Armed with this new information and now seeing the bigger cities such as Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles rocked by the rapidly spreading scourge, Cade ignores the volley of contradictory edicts drawn up by the White House and set into motion by FEMA and DHS, dusts off his tools of war, and loads his truck with supplies. Unable to get ahold of Brook and Raven and unwilling to leave them at the mercy of some distant politician's inability to hold the nation together, he begins an impossible 3,000 mile journey across a reeling United States with presumably millions of infected in his path and only one acceptable outcome: find Brook and Raven alive-or die trying.
