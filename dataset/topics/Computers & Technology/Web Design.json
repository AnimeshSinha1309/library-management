In this book Kaj Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k and Randall H. Trigg present a set of principles for the design of open hypermedia systems and provide concrete implications of these principles for issues ranging from data structures to architectures and system integration, and for settings as diverse as the World Wide Web and the workplace.The principles, which cover both hypermedia system processing and data structures, reflect results from decades of hypermedia research, including the popular Dexter hypertext reference model and the authors own extended object-oriented version of the Dexter model. One important principle is the notion of links as first-class objects outside the data. Emerging systems such as HyperWave, Microcosm, and Devise Hypermedia apply this principle to extend the capabilities of the Web. The authors also discuss the management of incomplete and dangling links, time-based media including video and sound, support for collaboration and shared hypermedia structures, worldwide distribution, and integration of third-party applications in open hypermedia systems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262071916"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262071918"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 386, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=71azq1SeHKUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=71azq1SeHKUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=71azq1SeHKUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Web+Design&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=71azq1SeHKUC&dq=subject:Web+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/From_Web_to_Workplace.html?hl=&id=71azq1SeHKUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=71azq1SeHKUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rRIVCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "ujQm6snocug", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rRIVCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Wired Professor", "subtitle": "A Guide to Incorporating the World Wide Web in College Instruction", "authors": ["Anne B.

The authors first introduce key concepts of Web caching and replication.They introduce HTTP's support for caching and replication, and broadly characterize Web behavior, offering practical rules of thumb for optimizing performance. Next, they focus on caching, helping implementers realistically assess proxy caching, deploy proxies in corporate and ISP networks; and utilize cooperative proxy caching.

Analysis addresses how tourism websites foster social action and, therefore, contribute to the (re)construction of nations and other communities by variably fostering re-imagination, rebirth, renaissance, promotion and caution, and patriotism. Recognizing that tourism texts can function to both construct and embody identity for their respective locales, this investigation employs critical discourse analysis, multimodal discourse analysis, and visual semiotic analysis in the investigation of web texts and images. \"In this immensely informative and provocative text Rick Hallett and Judith Kaplan-Weinger take to task the role of the world wide web in mediating the construction of identities. Theirs is a timely and thought-provoking book which makes a major contribution to the task of making the meanings of these sites transparent through discourse analysis.

The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud is an example of such an open data repository of attribute data in the form of billions of Resource Description Framework triples on the Web. Visualising such open data in thematic maps provides a powerful spatial analysis tool for planning and decision-making. In this research, several styles of creating web thematic maps by integrating the attributes from the LOD cloud with geometry in a spatial database server were investigated and evaluated. Requirements for a specialised geospatial web service that combines linked data with geospatial data to create thematic maps were specified. Standard technologies were used, motivated by the widespread deployment of standardised web map services in the geospatial community and the widespread publication of alphanumeric data (by statistical agencies) in the LOD cloud. A specialisation of an Open Geospatial Consortium Web Map Service (WMS) that creates web thematic maps by integrating alphanumeric linked data from the LOD cloud with geometry in a spatial database server was conceptualised. Three integration styles (referred to as design options) for this specialised web service were designed and implemented. The first style integrates linked data with spatial data by an importer. The second and third styles use a middleware and extension of a spatial database server respectively to integrate linked data with spatial data. In each of the three styles, attributes are retrieved from the LOD cloud through semantic queries and only the results of the semantic query are visualised on the thematic map. In this way, the benefits of semantic queries are exploited in the Semantic Web itself and the WMS mapping capabilities are used to visualise the semantic query results on a thematic map by integrating these with geospatial data. The three integration styles are critically evaluated against the specified requirements. This research contributes to understanding the pros and cons of incorporating semantic (linked) data models into standard geospatial web service models to create cartographic products (web thematic maps). This research contributes to bridging the gap between linked data and web thematic mapping.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "OCLC:1056952486"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 354, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Web"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tODxvQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Web+Design&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tODxvQEACAAJ&dq=subject:Web+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Evaluating_Different_Options_of_Integrat.html?hl=&id=tODxvQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tODxvQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "bHSukrGBiB4C", "etag": "fR6/iA8RGqE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/bHSukrGBiB4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Writing for Multimedia and the Web", "subtitle": "A Practical Guide to Content Development for Interactive Media", "authors": ["Timothy Paul Garrand"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "Learning how to write for just one type of interactive media, such as web sites or games, is not enough!

If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards. Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design. Our popular reference, Web Design in a Nutshell, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels. The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics: Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values. Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM) Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, Web Design in a Nutshell, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.

The International Programme Committee, encompassing 102 experts form all over the world, selected 150 full and 40 short papers out of 360 abstracts submitted to ICCHP. Our acceptance rate of about half of the submissions, demonstrates the scientific quality of the programme and in particular the proceedings you have in your hands. An impressive group of experts agreed to organize \u201cSpecial Thematic Sessions\u201d (STS) for ICCHP 2008. The existence of these STS sessions helped to bring the me- ing into sharper focus in several key areas of assistive technology. In turn, this deeper level of focus helped to bring together the state-of-the-art and mainstream technical, social, cultural and political developments. Our keynote speaker, Jim Fruchterman from BeneTech, USA highlighted the - portance of giving access to ICT and AT at a global level. In another keynote by H- old Thimbleby, Swansea University, UK, the role of user-centred design and usability engineering in assistive technology and accessibility was addressed. And finally, a combination keynote and panel discussion was reserved for WAI/WCAG2.0, which we expect to be the new reference point for Web accessibility from the summer of 2008 and beyond.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540705390"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540705392"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 1350, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&pg=PA482&dq=Web+Design+computers&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&dq=Web+Design+computers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Computers_Helping_People_with_Special_Ne.html?hl=&id=LokAvXdx5X0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computers_Helping_People_with_Special_Ne-sample-epub.acsm?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computers_Helping_People_with_Special_Ne-sample-pdf.acsm?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "11th International Conference, ICCHP 2008, Linz, Austria, July 9-11, 2008, <br>\nProceedings Klaus Miesenberger, Joachim Klaus, Wolfgang Zagler, Arthur <br>\nKarshmer.

If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards. Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design. Our popular reference, Web Design in a Nutshell, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels. The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics: Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values. Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM) Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, Web Design in a Nutshell, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.

We were proud to welcome participants from more than 40 countries from all con- nents to ICCHP. The International Programme Committee, encompassing 102 experts form all over the world, selected 150 full and 40 short papers out of 360 abstracts submitted to ICCHP. Our acceptance rate of about half of the submissions, demonstrates the scientific quality of the programme and in particular the proceedings you have in your hands. An impressive group of experts agreed to organize \u201cSpecial Thematic Sessions\u201d (STS) for ICCHP 2008. The existence of these STS sessions helped to bring the me- ing into sharper focus in several key areas of assistive technology. In turn, this deeper level of focus helped to bring together the state-of-the-art and mainstream technical, social, cultural and political developments. Our keynote speaker, Jim Fruchterman from BeneTech, USA highlighted the - portance of giving access to ICT and AT at a global level. In another keynote by H- old Thimbleby, Swansea University, UK, the role of user-centred design and usability engineering in assistive technology and accessibility was addressed. And finally, a combination keynote and panel discussion was reserved for WAI/WCAG2.0, which we expect to be the new reference point for Web accessibility from the summer of 2008 and beyond.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540705390"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540705392"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 1350, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&pg=PA482&dq=Web+Design+computers&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&dq=Web+Design+computers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Computers_Helping_People_with_Special_Ne.html?hl=&id=LokAvXdx5X0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computers_Helping_People_with_Special_Ne-sample-epub.acsm?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computers_Helping_People_with_Special_Ne-sample-pdf.acsm?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LokAvXdx5X0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "11th International Conference, ICCHP 2008, Linz, Austria, July 9-11, 2008, <br>\nProceedings Klaus Miesenberger, Joachim Klaus, Wolfgang Zagler, Arthur <br>\nKarshmer.

In that time I have again and again found myself in the position of having to introduce students, both undergraduate and graduate, colleagues and clients to the fundamentals of computer hardware and software. Over the years, as computers became both central and commonplace in professional life, I have been aware of changing attitudes toward this technology. From attitudes that ranged from the disdain of platonic dialecticians for mere technology to intimidation bordering at times almost on terror, people have moved to incorporate this new technology into their frame of reference ( humani nil a me alienum ). The development of the microprocessor and its subsequent use for word processing marked one important watershed. The widespread use of word processors made it more likely than not that people would own their own computers, at least at work, and use them as part of their work-a-day activities. But while word processing provided some increased familiarity with computers, it did not lead most indivi- als much beyond a knowledge of the usual incantations needed to control the MultiMate or Nota Bene or Word Perfect golam and, as a result of unhappy experience, a begrudging acceptance of the need to make back up copies of important files.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306469657"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306469650"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 344, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=Web+Design+computers&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-lCsTBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computing_in_the_Web_Age_A_Web_Interacti-sample-pdf.acsm?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lCsTBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>COMPUTING</b> ON THE WORLD WIDE <b>WEB</b> As a visit to the <b>computer</b> section of <br>\nany book store will confirm, there is a ... sensibility, and the habits of thought of <br>\nthose who <b>design computer</b> software and hardware but also to combine that 7 <br>\nFrom&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nBKjBgAAQBAJ", "etag": "qmXXU2mc9/w", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nBKjBgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Web Designer's Roadmap", "subtitle": "Your Creative Process for Web Design Success", "authors": ["Giovanni DiFeterici"], "publisher": "SitePoint", "publishedDate": "2012-08-29", "description": "The Web Designer's Roadmap is a full-color book about the creative process and the underlying principles that govern that process.
