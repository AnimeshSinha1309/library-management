Prior to its introduction, considerable advances had been made in the grafting of vital organs, particularly the kidney, heart and liver. In many developed countries, however, transplantation was not considered wo-rthwhile in terms of gain for the investment of resources. The improved results of kidney grafts following the use of cyclosporin has changed this attitude. For all types of organ transplantation, cyclosporin has resulted in an improvement of functional graft survival and has allowed a reduction in steroid dose and, in some cases, no steroids at all. It has permitted the first successful experimental transplantation of the heart and lungs in primate species by Reitz and colleagues and their results were applied directly to the clinic. It was largely due to the introduction of cyclosporin that the Washington Consensus Meeting on Liver Transplantation came to a favourable recommendation and the result has been the proliferation of units performing liver transplantation, approximately fifty in North America and another fifty in Europe, where previously there had been a handful. Having been involved in cyclosporin for organ grafting from the beginning, I have been able to witness these developments which have far exceeded my expectations once the nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin was demonstrated in man.

Many university Sport and Exercise Science courses in the UK and USA now have modules which are focused on exercise for health, and cover aspects of exercise science which are appropriate for clinical populations. The book would also be a very valuable resource for Undergraduate and Postgraduate Physiotherapy courses and a very useful resource for students of Exercise Science and Physiotherapy, as well as practitioners working with cancer patients.There are an increasing amount of research opportunities for exercise scientists who are interested in working with clinical populations. Furthermore, a considerable amount of Government and Charity research funding is being targeted at active lifestyles and this is helping to generate a new culture of collaboration between exercise scientists and medics. Hence, it is highly likely that an increasing number of students from Sport and Exercise Science courses will pursue careers within the clinical realm in the future.

The active ingredient itself must be formulated into a finished dosage form that can be conveniently used by health care professionals and patients. Properties of the biopharmaceutical molecule must be clearly understood so that the appropriate finished product formulation can be developed.

Antimicrobial agents seemed at first to be an exception. They did not need to be delivered through a cold chain and to everyone, as vaccines did. They had to be given only to infected patients and often then as relatively cheap injectables or pills off a shelf for only a few days to get astonishing cures. Antimicrobials not only were better than most other innovations but also reached more of the world\u2019s people sooner. The problem appeared later. After each new antimicrobial became widely used, genes expressing resistance to it began to emerge and spread through bacterial populations.

There have been dramatic changes in approaches for identifying new chemical entities with a desired biological activity. While chemical modification of existing leads was the most important approach in the 1970s and 1980s, high-throughput screening and structure-based design are now major players among a multitude of methods used in drug discov ery. Quite often, companies favor one of these relatively new approaches over the other, e.g., screening over rational design, or vice versa, but we believe that an intelligent and concerted use of several or all methods currently available to drug discovery will be more successful in the medium term. What has changed most significantly in the past few years is the time available for identifying new chemical entities. Because of the high costs of drug discovery projects, pressure for maximum success in the shortest possible time is higher than ever. In addition, the multidisciplinary character of the field is much more pronounced today than it used to be. As a consequence, researchers and project managers in the pharmaceutical industry should have a solid knowledge of the more important methods available to drug discovery, because it is the rapidly and intelligently combined use of these which will determine the success or failure of preclinical projects.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783034879972"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3034879970"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 292, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.5.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RSDyBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Modern_Methods_of_Drug_Discovery-sample-epub.acsm?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Modern_Methods_of_Drug_Discovery-sample-pdf.acsm?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RSDyBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ngjb0f45T4oC", "etag": "q+OZnJcUi+Q", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ngjb0f45T4oC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "5-HT2C Receptors in the Pathophysiology of CNS Disease", "authors": ["Giuseppe Di Giovanni", "Ennio Esposito", "Vincenzo Di Matteo"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30", "description": "Part of Springer\u2019s \u201cThe Receptors,\u201d series, this text is the first ever overview on the research of 5-HT2c receptors. 5-HT2c receptor research has been productive for twenty-five years, but recent years have seen an extraordinary increase in both amount produced and insight gained. 5-HT2c is a prominent central serotonin receptor subtype widely expressed within the central and the peripheral nervous system and is thought to play a key role in the regulation of numerous behaviors.

I was very fortunate to work for the company that begat the biotech industry during its formative years. This experience established a solid foundation from which I could grow in both the science and business of biotechnology. After my fourth year of working on Oyster Point Boulevard, a close friend and colleague left Genentech to join a start-up biotechnology company. Later, he approached me to leave and join him in of all places \u2013 Oklahoma. He persisted for at least a year before I seriously considered his proposal. After listening to their plans, the opportunity suddenly became more and more intriguing. Finally, I took the plunge and joined this ent- preneurial team in cofounding and growing a start-up biotechnology company. Making that fateful decision to leave the security of a larger company was extremely difficult, but it turned out to be the beginning of an entrepreneurial career that forever changed how I viewed the biotechnology industry. Since that time, I have been fortunate to have cofounded two other biotechnology com- nies and even participated in taking one of them public.

The key concept is to look at the balance between the benefits and risks of drugs, but in this context also highlighting the social impact which drugs have in modern societies. Taking an evidence-based approach to the problem, the practice of clinical pharmacology and pharmacotherapy in the developing as well as the developed world is examined. For this purpose the book covers general clinical pharmacology, pharmacology of various drug groups and the treatments specific to various diseases; the book gives guidance on how doctors should act so that drugs can be used effectively and safely; and it encourages the rational use of drugs in society. This publication brings together a large amount of excellent content that will be invaluable for anyone working within, or associated with, the field of clinical pharmacology and pharmacotherapy - undergraduates, postgraduates, regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781607503453"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "160750345X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 848, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=idbvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=idbvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=idbvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=idbvAgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Drug_Benefits_and_Risks.html?hl=&id=idbvAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=idbvAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Mev1CAAAQBAJ", "etag": "p9yVYPjp5ZI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Mev1CAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Peptides of Poisonous Amanita Mushrooms", "authors": ["Theodor Wieland"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "During the past few decades we have witnessed an era of remarkable growth in the field of molecular biology. In 1950 very little was known ofthe chemical constitution of biological systems, the manner in which information was transmitted from one organism to another, or the extent to which the chemical basis of life is unified. The picture today is dramatically different. We have an almost bewildering variety of information detailing many different aspects oflife at the molecular level. These great advances have brought with them some breath-taking insights into the molecular mechanisms used by nature for replicating, distributing and modifying biological information. We have learned a great deal about the chemical and physical nature of the macro molecular nucleic acids and proteins, and the manner in which carbohydrates, lipids and smaller molecules work together to provide the molecular setting of living systems. It might be said that these few decades have replaced a near vacuum of informa tion with a very large surplus. It is in the context of this flood of information that this series of monographs on molecular biology has been organized. The idea is to bring together in one place, between the covers of one book, a concise assessment of the state of the subject in a well-defined field. This will enable the reader to get a sense of historical perspective what is known about the field today - and a description of the frontiers of research where our knowledge is increasing steadily.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642712951"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642712959"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 258, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Mev1CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Peptides_of_Poisonous_Amanita_Mushrooms-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Mev1CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "j2HEBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "0swgoEa33Wc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/j2HEBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Tactics in Contemporary Drug Design", "authors": ["Nicholas A.

In addition to scientific organisations dedi cated to modern Western medicine, e. g. the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and various medical schools, a series of parallel institutions have been established in China to promote traditional Chinese medicine, such as the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and training institutions. Almost all hospitals in China have a department of traditional medicine. Furthermore, a large number of scientific journals are dedicated to traditional Chinese medicine, covering both experimental and clinical investigations. Medicinal materials constitute a key topic in the treatment of disease according to traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia (1985 edition) is therefore divided into two sepa rate volumes, Volume I containing traditional Chinese medicinal materials and preparations and Volume II containing pharmaceu tics of Western medicine. The oldest Chinese review of medicinal materials, Shennong Bencao Jing (100-200 A. D. ), covered 365 herbal drugs.

It is not proposed to provide a resume here. In this Volume I, the current edition attempts to provide data about raw materials in a more formalized way than before, so that not only the history of some compounds can be checked, but also so that useful reference information can be obtained. It is particularly relevant to do this, since it is not always easy to be certain of nomenclature. Moreover, as we move towards 'ingredient labelling' (a trend not welcomed by some), a high level of uniformity will be needed.

Hartwell Director, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Nobel Laureate for Medicine, 2001 Yeast has proved to be the most useful single-celled organism for studying the fundamental aspects of cell biology. Resources are now available for yeast that greatly simplify and empower new investigations, like the presence of strains with each gene deleted, each protein tagged and databases on protein\u2013protein interactions, gene regulation, and subcellular protein location. A powerful combination of genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry employed by thousands of yeast researchers has unraveled the complexities of numerous cellular processes from mitosis to secretion and even uncovered new insights into prion diseases and the role of prions in normal biology. These insights have proven, time and again, to foretell the roles of proteins and pathways in human cells. The collection of articles in this volume explores the use of yeast in pathway analysis and drug discovery. Yeast has, of course, supplied mankind\u2019s most ubiquitous drug for thousands of years. In one aspect, the role of yeast in drug discovery is much like the role of yeast in other areas of biology. Yeast offers the power of genetics and a repetoire of resources available in no other organism. Using yeast in the study of drug targets and metabolism can help to make a science of what has been largely an empirical activity.

Many excellent books and reviews exist that examine the experimental methodology employed in specific areas of molecular biology and regulation of gene expression. However, we have noticed a lack of books, especially textbooks, that provide an overview of the rationale and general experimental approaches used to examine chemically or disease-mediated alterations in gene expression in mammalian systems. For example, it has been difficult to find appropriate texts that examine specific experimental goals, such as proving that an increased level of mRNA for a given gene is attributable to an increase in transcription rates. Regulation of Gene Expression: Molecular Mechanisms is intended to serve as either a textbook for graduate students or as a basic reference for laboratory personnel.

Research and developmental efforts related to controlled release are multiplying in both industry and academia. The reason for this phenomenal growth is obvious. The use of a variety of biologically active agents, such as drugs, fertilizers and pesticides, has become an integral part of modern society. Along with the use of these reagents has evolved an awareness that their uncontrolled application almost inevitably induces harmful effects on the health of humans and their surrounding environments. To eliminate or minimize these harmful effects necessitates the controlled release of these chemicals. Moreover, the controlled release of substances, not usually considered toxic or hazardous, e.g., some catalysts and nutrients, can enhance their effectiveness. The number and variety of controlled release systems, differing in their physical and chemical makeup, are increasing rapidly. Proliferation almost always demands correlation, generalization and unification; it requires both the development of underlying theories of their behavior and the mechanistic interpretation of their performance. This, in turn, requires a statistical and mathematical (quantitative) treatment of the scientific information and technical data pertaining to them. A quantitative treatment can also facilitate the formulation of procedures for computer-aided design of these systems through a priori prediction of their per formance for a variety of design parameters.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642745072"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642745075"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 233, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Controlled_Release-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Vuv1CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TKIRVzXrwKkC", "etag": "SUkCl9PEq70", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TKIRVzXrwKkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Physical Activity, Dietary Calorie Restriction, and Cancer", "authors": ["Anne McTiernan"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2010-11-18", "description": "The World Health Organization estimates that 25 percent of common cancers can be prevented through regular physical activity and weight control.

Every effort has been made to avoid an abstruse presentation. It should be clear that one individual cannot be expert in all the disciplines considered here (and the authors recognize that fact with sin cere humility). As may be expected of an introductory reference, most of our attention was focused on the commonly used methods. To balance this, we have included a few examples of approaches which are promising but relatively undeveloped at this time. Also, an emphasis has been placed on element selectivity.

Sweet first developed the chromatographic method by using an adsorbant to separate pigments. Since that time, the technological advances in TLC and HPLC have brought about new definitions of purity in parallel with the advances.

Even the most stringent control of anthropogenic Hg sources will not eliminate exposure given its ubiquitous presence. Exposure to Hg occurs primarily via the food chain due to MeHg\u2019s accumulation in fish. Latest US statistics indicate that 46 States have fish consumption advisories. In addition, Hg is a common pollutant in hazardous waste sites, with an estimated 3-4 million children living within one mile of at least one of the 1,300+ active hazardous waste sites in the US. The effects on intellectual function in children prenatally exposed to MeHg via maternal fish consumption have been the subject of two on-going major, prospective, longitudinal studies in the Seychelles and the Faroe Islands. It is important to recognize that the risk for MeHg exposure is not limited only to islanders with high fish consumption.

The development of new drugs for diabetes and obesity must be founded upon a sound appreciation of the pathophysiology of these common disorders. The dual defects of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion are fundamental to the pathogenesis and progression of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. There is a need to explain how new drugs can counter insulin resistance and insulin deficiency to a broad range of professionals, from clinical scientists active in early (and later) phase drug development to specialist physicians and increasingly primary care doctors who must tailor drug regimens to the individual patient. Clinical research methods for measuring insulin action and insulin secretion have become well-established in proof-of-mechanism studies; however, selection of the best techniques is by no means straightforward. The purpose of the book is to aid the selection of the most appropriate techniques for assessing insulin action, insulin secretion and body composition in humans (with particular reference to new drugs) in phase 1 and 2 studies and aid the understanding of drug effects and non-drug treatment strategies on key biochemical-hormonal defects of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Long overlooked as a milder form of pain, itching has rapidly gained a new appreciation in both research and clinical communities because of its complexity and its negative effects on the quality of life of the distressed patients. Like pain, not all itches are the same. Unlike pain, there are no standard drugs equivalent to aspirin and morphine. Epidemiological studies emphasize the high incidence and economic costs of itch (pruritus). It is the most prevalent symptom of a wide variety of allergic and inflammatory skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis), is associated with several systemic diseases (e.g., chronic kidney and liver disease), and occurs in patients undergoing hemodialysis, spinal administration of opioids, and in those suffering from AIDS. The reader will learn about the multiple pathways for itch and their interactions with pain. The relationship between these closely related, yet distinct sensory phenomena, will be emphasized. Both itch and pain use several common molecules to send signals to the brain. Thus, drugs that have been, and are being, developed as analgesics may also attenuate intractable itch. This has been an exciting and very necessary turn of events since traditional H-1 receptor antagonists are ineffective in blocking the pruritus associated with kidney failure and cholestasis.

The high speed and high separation efficiency which can be attained using any of the various modes of HPCE has resulted in the increased use of the technique in a range of analytical environments. The procedures are, however, still in the early stages of development and several barriers remain to their adoption as the technique of choice for a range of analytical problems. One such barrier is the selection and optimization of the conditions required to achieve reproducible separations of analytes and it is in this area that this new book seeks to give assistance. The book is written by an international team of authors, drawn from both academic and industrial users, and the manufacturers of instruments. At its heart are a number of tables, divided into specific application areas. These give details of published separations of a wide range of archetypal analytes, the successful separation conditions and the matrix in which they were presented. These tables are based on separations reported since 1992 and are fully referenced to the original literature. The tables are supported by discussions of the problems that a particular area presents and the strategies and solutions adopted to overcome them. The general areas covered are biochemistry, pharmaceutical science, bioscience, ion analysis, food analysis and environmental science.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400915619"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400915616"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 738, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=52&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ASPpCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Handbook_of_Capillary_Electrophoresis_Ap-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ASPpCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VebcBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "yusKFopGCYo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VebcBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Methods for Protein Analysis", "subtitle": "A Practical Guide for Laboratory Protocols", "authors": ["Robert A.

By fabricating at the nanoscale, it is possible to exert unprecedented control on drug activity. This textbook will showcase a variety of nanosystems working from their design and construction to their application in the field of drug delivery. The book is intended for graduate students in drug delivery, physical and polymer chemistry, and applied pharmaceutical sciences courses that involve fundamental nanoscience. The purpose of the text is to present physicochemical and biomedical properties of synthetic polymers with an emphasis on their application in polymer therapeutics i.e., pharmaceutical nanosystems, drug delivery and biological performance. There are two main objectives of this text. The first is to provide advanced graduate students with knowledge of the principles of nanosystems and polymer science including synthesis, structure, and characterization of solution and solid state properties. The second is to describe the fundamentals of therapeutic applications of polymers in drug delivery, targeting, response modifiers as well as regulatory issues. The courses, often listed as Advanced Drug Delivery and Applied Pharmaceutics; Polymer Therapeutics; or Nanomedicine, are designed as an overview of the field specifically for graduate students in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Programs. However, the course content may also be of interest for graduate students in related biomedical research programs. These courses generally include a discussion of the major principles of polymer science and fundamental concepts of application of polymers as modern therapeutics. All courses are moving away from the above mentioned course names and going by \u2018pharmaceutical nanoscience or nanosystems\u2019.

As a consequence of the intrinsic chromosomal and genetic instability of the tumor genome, it is generally believed that tailoring of chemotherapy in cancer - tients might be achieved by molecular analysis of patient tumor DNA. In addition, to reduce the toxicity risk of patients, the tumor DNA information should be in- grated with the available data on polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzyme and tra- porter genes mediating the exposure of patients to active drugs and/or their active metabolites. The chapters of this book clearly show how DNA information from both the host (germline) and the tumor should be taken into account for rational selection of drug therapies in cancer patients, an aspect that received little attention, despite its importance. The availability of new molecular approaches to the selection of drug therapy is an emerging need, because the traditional approach based on the evaluation of patient and tumor characteristics is clearly far from optimal. Many treated patients do not experience signi?cant bene?ts from the treatment, while they often experience moderate to severe toxicities. In addition, the development and clinical use of novel molecularly targeted agents (alone or in combination with classical cytotoxic therapy) requires the und- standing of the molecular features of the tumors and the identi?cation of tumor markers of response.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603270884"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603270885"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 378, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&rdid=book-QEJyUxTf1AMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Genomics_and_Pharmacogenomics_in_Antican-sample-epub.acsm?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Genomics_and_Pharmacogenomics_in_Antican-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QEJyUxTf1AMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "PR8DCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "BnSRL8t5eVk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/PR8DCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Antiviral Chemotherapy 4", "subtitle": "New Directions for Clinical Application and Research", "authors": ["John Mills", "Paul A.

Moreover. oral ganciclovir, cidofovir, and sorivudine are not far behind. Clinical trials with the second-site reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the protease inhibitors for HlV infection are proceeding rapidly and on a broad scale, and the preliminary results would suggest that several of these classes of drugs will be licensed as well. Despite this optimism, however, there is increasing evidence that antiviral-resistant strains of pathogenic viruses will be a significant problem, perhaps especially with therapy of HIV infection, and there remains a desperate need for improved drugs (with either improved efficacy or decreased toxicity, or both) for CMV and HIV infections. This book is the edited proceedings of the Fourth Triennial Conference on Antiviral Chemotherapy, held in San Francisco, in November 1994. The conference was sponsored by the University of California, San Francisco, and co-sponsored by the International Society for Antiviral Research (ISAR), the Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia, and the Australian National Centre for HIV Virology Research.

These include our understanding of Fever, which is now considered not simply a rise in deep body temperature foHowing infection, but just one aspect, though perhaps the most easily measured, of the Acute Phase of the Immune Response. Classification and identification of the Cytokines and the availability of recombinant material has greatly aided this research. Similarly, our understanding of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary Adrenal Axis has altered our way of thinking about temperature regulation. Of importance are the problems associated with adverse climatic conditions and survival, and the problems encountered by the neonate and the hibernator. At the biochemical level, our knowledge of the control of heat production and the role of brown adipose tissue is rapidly advancing. All these issues and many others were discussed at a Symposium 'Thermal Physiology 1993' held in Aberdeen, Scotland in August 1993 under the auspices of the Thermal Physiology Commission of the International Union of Physiological Sciences. Six main aspects of the subject of temperature regulation are included in this book, namely, Fever (including the Acute Phase of the Immune Response and Thermoregulatory Peptides), Neurophysiology of Thermoregulation, Neonatal Thermoregulation, Mechanisms of Heat Production, Ecological and Behavioural Thermoregulation, and Emerging Themes in Thermoregulation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783034884914"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3034884915"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 376, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=58&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-GD4BCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Temperature_Regulation-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GD4BCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tEYkBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "ihv2Az1GmL8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tEYkBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms", "authors": ["Robert B.

Holowka", "Sujata K. Bhatia"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2014-11-22", "description": "Current pharmaceutical and clinical approaches to the treatment of disease suffer from the inherent limitations in the specialization of drugs introduced to physiological systems. The interface of clinical and material sciences has allowed for a broad spectrum of creative approaches with the potential to alleviate these shortcomings. However, the synergy of these disciplines also presents problems in which nascent technology lacks the necessary evaluation within its intended clinical environment. Given the growing potential for materials science to address a number of unanswered therapeutic needs, it remains even more pressing to validate emerging drug delivery technologies in actual clinical environments. Drug Delivery: Materials Design and Clinical Perspective addresses the core fundamentals of drug delivery using material science and engineering principles, and then applies this knowledge using prominent examples from both the scientific literature and clinical practice. Each chapter focuses on a specific drug delivery technology, such as controlled-release materials, thin-film materials, or smart materials. Within each chapter, an initial section on \u201cEngineering Concepts\u201d reviews the relevant fundamental principles that guide rational design. The following section on \u201cMaterials Design\u201d discusses how the design process applies engineering concepts for use in physiological systems. A third section on \u201cImplementation\u201d discusses current approaches in the literature which have demonstrated effective drug delivery in controlled environments. Finally, each chapter contains several sections on \u201cClinical Applications\u201d which describe the validity of materials approaches from a clinical perspective; these sections review the safety and efficacy of drug delivery systems for specific, compelling medical applications. The book thereby bridges materials science with clinical medicine, and provides the reader with a bench-to-bedside view of novel drug delivery systems. \u00b7 Provides a comprehensive description of drug delivery systems from a materials perspective \u00b7 Includes a wide-ranging discussion of clinical applications of drug delivery systems \u00b7 Presents separate chapters on controlled release materials, thin film materials, self-microemulsifying materials, smart materials, etc. \u00b7 Covers fundamental engineering principles, rational materials design, implementation testing, and clinical applications for each material type", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781493919987"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1493919989"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 355, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=64&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6289.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6289.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-uvWSBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6289400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6289400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Drug_Delivery-sample-epub.acsm?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Drug_Delivery-sample-pdf.acsm?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uvWSBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "07g30rxCA0EC", "etag": "XkdZZYoXvP4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/07g30rxCA0EC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Medicinal Chemistry", "authors": ["Ashutosh Kar"], "publisher": "New Age International", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "The Qualified Success And General Appeal Of Medicinal Chemistry Is Not Only Confined To The Indian Subcontinent, But It Has Also Won An Overwhelming Popularity In Other Parts Of The World.

Fast for ward to the world today and our ability to treat life-threatening infec tions. This is but one small piece in the present kaleidoscope of new therapeutic agents. In fact, the world of science, biology, and medi cine is changing so quickly that it is difficult for scientists and medi cal practitioners to stay abreast of their fields and confidently anticipate that their education and training will sustain them over a three- to four-decade career without considerable continuing educa tion and training. For the pharmaceutical scientist responsible for the discovery and development of therapeutic agents based on advances in biotechnology, it is imperative to quickly come up to speed and stay at the forefront of developments, which is no easy task for those not specifically trained in this area. Biopharmaceutical Drug Design and Development, edited by Susanna Wu-Pong and Yongyut Rojanasakul, cuts a potentially wide swath in terms of its intended audience.

The organizer of the symposium on discriminable stimuli induced by drugs, Dr. Harbans Lal, did seduce me into attending. Having lost my behavioral virginity, I now stare with open eyes at the field. One item in particular at this meeting exemplifies to me the power of such techniques. Dr. Albert Weissman mentioned the problem he tackled with getting rats to discriminate between saline and dilute solutions of aspirin. Under ordinary circumstances, the animals could not perform this task. However, if the animals were sensitized by injection of prostaglan din into their foot pads, then they were capable of discriminating even very dilute solutions of aspirin. In a sense, Al had created a model of the human arthritic who can jolly well tell if you have given him an aspirin or a salt tablet. The reader of this volume will find it a good introduction to the utilization of discriminable stimuli induced by drugs. After a preface by the organizer, two experts discuss basic principles in separate chapters. One of these chapters places emphasis on the drugs; the other places emphasis on the induced cues and states.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468430905"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468430904"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8826.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8826.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8826400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8826400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Discriminative_Stimulus_Properties_of_Dr-sample-epub.acsm?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Discriminative_Stimulus_Properties_of_Dr-sample-pdf.acsm?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=H5ZyBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "x3SjDDjlW00C", "etag": "fLiy1m8CBGE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/x3SjDDjlW00C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Pocket Handbook of GI Pharmacotherapeutics", "authors": ["George Y.

The development of effective drugs is one of the wonders of our century. It is difficult to believe that so few of the medicines we now use routinely were available when our grandparents were children. The last 50 years has seen an astonishing burst of dis coveries - antibiotics, antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, psycho tropics, anticonvulsants, steroids and many others. Of course this pace of advance has brought problems. Modern drugs are more powerful than the remedies they replaced, so it takes more skill and knowledge to use them correctly. Therapeutics has had to become more disciplined and now relies heavily on clinical pharma cology, which is the science of drugs in man. The tradition of this series of books has been to answer the questions an intelligent person would ask about a particular subject. Conventional texts on pharmacology can seem rather dull catalogues of drugs. Of course it is important to identify a drug, but it seems of greater importance to know how drugs work, how they are chosen for particular patients, what problems they produce and why. In this book the Socratic question and answer format has been deliberately chosen to bring out this sort of information.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401172431"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401172439"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 180, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Essential_Clinical_Pharmacology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZzH7CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Yh8DCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "N8jJwm8c4l0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Yh8DCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Botulinum and Tetanus Neurotoxins", "subtitle": "Neurotransmission and Biomedical Aspects", "authors": ["B.R.

While still realizing the numerous activating, modifying and protective inputs, I cannot judge the meaningfulness of the meeting impartially. Neither may the reader expect a complete summary of all presentations. Collected in this volume, they speak for themselves without requiring an arbiter. Instead I shall write down my very personal opinions as a researcher who has studied clostridial neurotoxins for nearly 25 years. Comparable conferences have been rare during this time. A comprehensive symposium 4 on C. botulinum neurotoxins has been organized at Ft. Detrick. International conferences on tetanus have been held regularly under the auspices of the Wodd Health Organization. One or maximally two days of these meetings have been devoted to tetanus toxin and its actions whereas the sponsor and the majority of the participants have been interested mainly in epidemiology, prevention and treatment of tetanus as a disease (see refs. 5,6). Some aspects of clostridial neurotoxins have been addressed in the context of bacterial toxins, in particular in the biennial European workshops. 1-3,7,8 The Madison meeting differed from the previous ones in three aspects. First, it covered both tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins. The fusion was justified because of their huge similarities in primary structure, in their mode of action and in their cellular targets. Second, the meeting was not limited to toxins but drew some lines on which modern neurobiology might proceed.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781475795424"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1475795424"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 689, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 19352, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 19352, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19352000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19352000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Botulinum_and_Tetanus_Neurotoxins-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Yh8DCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QwihCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "S6d3zRZeO8E", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QwihCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Endocannabinoids", "authors": ["Roger G.

The book facilitates understanding of ocular drug therapy by compiling all key aspects of the pharmacology, toxicology, pharmaceutical science, ocular biochemistry and cell biology of these agents. Chapters detail drug transfer across barriers, systemic toxicity of topically applied drugs, autonomic drugs used for diagnostics, as well as anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, glaucoma and antimicrobial therapies, and avenues for the development of new ocular drugs. Applications of extemporaneously prepared formulations are described to inform day-to-day clinical practice. The use of mucoadhesive polymers in tear substitutes, ocular drug delivery systems, stem cell therapy, pharmacogenomics and antiangiogenic ocular chemotherapy are also explored. The book also provides insights from drugs of herbal origin, and a historical perspective on drugs for ocular use.

The book facilitates understanding of ocular drug therapy by compiling all key aspects of the pharmacology, toxicology, pharmaceutical science, ocular biochemistry and cell biology of these agents. Chapters detail drug transfer across barriers, systemic toxicity of topically applied drugs, autonomic drugs used for diagnostics, as well as anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, glaucoma and antimicrobial therapies, and avenues for the development of new ocular drugs. Applications of extemporaneously prepared formulations are described to inform day-to-day clinical practice. The use of mucoadhesive polymers in tear substitutes, ocular drug delivery systems, stem cell therapy, pharmacogenomics and antiangiogenic ocular chemotherapy are also explored.

In many cases it is unavoidable that nanoparticles are released into the environment, either during the production processes or during the use of a product made from these particles. It is also realized that combustion processes like traffic and power plants release nanoparticles into the atmosphere. However it is not known how nanoparticles interact with the human body, especially upon inhalation. At the same time research activities are devoted to understand how nano-sized medicine particles can be used to administer medicines via inhalation. In any case it is absolutely necessary to know how the nanoparticles interfere with the inhalation system, how they deposit and affect on the human system. Three main themes are discussed: Nanoparticle sources and production Nanoparticle inhalation and deposition Toxicological and medical consequences of nanoparticles Each theme is covered comprehensively, starting at nano-quantum effects up to technical and medical applications such as measuring equipment and inhalation instrumentation.

However, the two main classes of drugs used are the opioids and the non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, drugs that have a long history. The last decade has seen remarkable advances in our understanding of some of the pharmacological bases of pain and analgesia and this book aims to reflect these rapid changes in our understanding of pain mechanisms. One impetus to these scientific advances has been dialogue and interactions between scientists and clinicians; as a result we now has a number of animal models of clinical pain states, to mimic certain aspects of clinical pathophysiological pain states. Molecular aspects of receptors and the synthesis of tools for probing receptor function have also been rapid growth areas. A number of controlled clinical studies using novel licensed drugs have also resulted from recent research, offering hope to certain patients with severe intractable pain. However, we desperately need the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs based on these novel targets for analgesic therapy. This book attempts to provide an overview of the important areas of the pharmacology of pain. This book, although providing an account of the pharmacology of pain transmission and its control based on the underlying anatomical organization and physiological responses, does not attempt to cover these latter two areas.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642607776"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642607772"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 479, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-eyPwCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Pharmacology_of_Pain-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eyPwCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CxzyCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "eo0bN0jfqTc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CxzyCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Mass Spectrometry", "subtitle": "A Textbook", "authors": ["J\u00fcrgen H Gross"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2011-01-19", "description": "This book offers a balanced mixture of practice-oriented information and theoretical background as well as numerous references, clear illustrations, and useful data tables.

May 1996 Preface to the first edition This book is the result of a group of development scientists feeling that there was an urgent need for a reference work that would assist chemists in understanding the science involved in the development of new products. The approach is to inform in a way that allows and encourages the reader to develop his or her own creativity in working with marketing colleagues on the introduction of new products. Organised on a product category basis, emphasis is placed on formulation, selection of raw materials, and the technology of producing the products discussed. Performance considerations, safety, product liability and all aspects of quality are covered. Regulations governing the production and sale of cosmetic products internationally are described, and sources for updated information provided. Throughout the book, reference is made to consumer pressure and environmental issues-concerns which the development scientist and his or her marketing counterpart ignore at their own, and their employer's peril. In recent years, many cosmetic fragrances and toiletry products have been converted from aerosols to mechanically press uri sed products or sprays, and these are described along with foam products such as hair conditioning mousses.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400915558"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400915551"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 396, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-VW3sCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chemistry_and_Technology_of_the_Cosmetic-sample-pdf.acsm?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VW3sCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kJMpBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "nEovsBXGc9E", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kJMpBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Capsaicin as a Therapeutic Molecule", "authors": ["Omar M.

Individual sections are dedicated to the nature of heparin as a biological molecule, the current approaches and techniques that are used to ensure the safety and reliability of heparin as a medicine, the clinical pharmacology of heparin as an anticoagulant drug, effects and potential applications of heparin aside of those involving haemostasis and, finally, the nature and potential uses of heparin-like materials from both natural and synthetic sources.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642230561"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642230563"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 462, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0M42r92k6S8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0M42r92k6S8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0M42r92k6S8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0M42r92k6S8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0M42r92k6S8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 25960, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 25960, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0M42r92k6S8C&rdid=book-0M42r92k6S8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 25960000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 25960000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Heparin_A_Century_of_Progress-sample-epub.acsm?id=0M42r92k6S8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Heparin_A_Century_of_Progress-sample-pdf.acsm?id=0M42r92k6S8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0M42r92k6S8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "RzfjBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "3KyROcYQz74", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RzfjBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "High Density Lipoproteins", "subtitle": "From Biological Understanding to Clinical Exploitation", "authors": ["Arnold von Eckardstein", "Dimitris Kardassis"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2014-12-18", "description": "In this Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology on \u201cHigh Density Lipoproteins \u2013 from biological understanding to clinical exploitation\u201d contributing authors (members of COST Action BM0904/HDLnet) summarize in more than 20 chapters our current knowledge on the structure, function, metabolism and regulation of HDL in health and several diseases as well as the status of past and ongoing attempts of therapeutic exploitation.

Biomedical and anthropological data on the use of ayahuasca for treating depression, PTSD, and substance dependence in different settings, such as indigenous contexts, neo-shamanic rituals, contemporary therapeutic circles, and in ayahuasca religions, in both South and North America, are presented and critiqued. Though multiple anecdotal reports on the therapeutic use of ayahuasca exist, there has been no systematic and dense reflection on the topic thus far. The book brings the therapeutic use of ayahuasca to a new level of public examination and academic debate.

In China, traditional herbal medicine has been used for more than 3000 years while in Japan, its use has been documented for more than 1000 years, albeit with some changes to the original Chinese formulations. Recently there has been a revival of interest in herbal medicines for several reasons. There is a rapid growth in the number of senior citizens who frequently require the attention of modern medicine. In particular, there has been an increase in the number of patients who suffer from chronic diseases which are difficult to treat, e.g., arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain syndromes, etc. It has become evident that traditional Oriental herbal medicines could playa role in the management of these and other conditions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9784431682608"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "4431682600"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 183, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-caVyBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Pain_and_Kampo-sample-epub.acsm?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Pain_and_Kampo-sample-pdf.acsm?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=caVyBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "udlELa8_6aoC", "etag": "gzu02PWMuw0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/udlELa8_6aoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Behavioral Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and Its Treatment", "authors": ["Neal R.

Yet fieldwork education has not received the attention, resources, research and status it deserves. This is why this book is so important. The focus upon the students' experience reflects the central tenet of the book: the responsibility, challenge and pleasure of life-long learning. The book covers the whole spectrum of fieldwork in a way which will be of interest to academic and fieldwork educators too. This is achieved through a striking balance between reas suring, practical advice and scholarliness. The reader is encouraged to enter into current debates, engage in inter-disciplinary and international comparisons and appreciate the tensions between professional issues and organizational contexts. The insights into the logistical, political and educational factors which contribute to the theory-practice gap are noteworthy. In my view, the authors have produced an excellent introduction to fieldwork education, and especially to the complexities of clinical reasoning which is a vital component of initial and continuing competence for many professions.

Our understanding of asthma has changed dramatically in recent years, and much of this new information is brought together in this volume written by inter nationally recognised authorities. The aim of the book is to review in depth the changing concepts of inflammatory processes in asthma and to discuss the implications for research of this common chronic disease. Many of the advances in and future therapy our understanding of asthma have originated from a pharmacological approach, and this volume highlights the promising new options for pharma cological intervention. It is hoped this book will be invaluable for research scientists and clinic ians involved in asthma research and will be a major reference resource for chest physicians and those involved in the development of novel pharmaceu tical entities.

Recent research has shown that BRAF inhibitors are effective for a short period of time, but there is little hope that this drugs as single agents will lead to durable benefit in a majority of patients. Among scientists and researchers who work in drug discovery, there is a lot of interest in the development of molecularly targeted cancer agents. Namely, the identification of a molecular target, the selection of molecules which effectively inhibit this target. What is starkly different about the development of this class of compounds, however, is that the mechanism of action of these agents are not as straightforward as was once previously assumed and the mechanisms of resistance that tumor cells employ to evade complete destruction are unlike any that have been described before. These discoveries in addition to utilization of modern molecular biology techniques have led to a series of hypotheses regarding which other types of molecules could be used in combination with BRAF-inhibitors in hopes of revolutionizing the potential of therapeutics in melanoma.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781493921430"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1493921436"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 204, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.5.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=118&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-F_yWBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/BRAF_Targets_in_Melanoma-sample-epub.acsm?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/BRAF_Targets_in_Melanoma-sample-pdf.acsm?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=F_yWBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "54nEePGqymcC", "etag": "HEeaNtAWK70", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/54nEePGqymcC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Progestins and the Mammary Gland", "subtitle": "From Basic Science to Clinical Applications", "authors": ["Orla M.

It is not intended to provide an answer to every conceivable management situation. The organization and delivery of health and social services is being subjected to relentless scrutiny and change. Hardly has one proposal been implemented before another one is introduced. In view of this, the thrust of this book is to highlight key points to be addressed when looking at the delivery of occupational therapy services. For this reason, the book starts from the viewpoint of one who is in the early stages of an occupational therapy career through to the position of having to manage the staff in an occupational therapy departmentl service. Following this plan, the book has been organized into two parts. Part One covers issues that an occupational therapist has to confront directly in any job situation. In this situation, she will need to know wh at is expected of her. Apart from knowing about the various duties, it is necessary to understand the context in which these duties are to be conducted. Hence, there are chapters that discuss professional responsibilities, self-management, stan dards of practice, and the structure of the two biggest employers of occupational therapists - the NHS and local authority social services departments.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781489931429"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1489931422"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pharmacology&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FjEBCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Management_in_Occupational_Therapy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FjEBCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
