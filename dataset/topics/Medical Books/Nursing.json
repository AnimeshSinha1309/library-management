With the rise of post-registration clinical skills courses, advanced practitioners, and the new medical assistant roles, it is anticipated that future professional practice will involve more emphasis on clinical skills for nurses.The Oxford Handbook of Clinical Skills in Adult Nursing provides a practical, easily accessible, concise and evidence-based guide to all the essential elements of clinical skills for nursing practice in one portable format. The first section deals with the principles underlying patient assessment, and professional issues relating to clinical skills in order to help practitioners perform procedures safely and competently. This is followed by chapters on generic skills such as communication, hygiene and comfort, infection control, intravenous access, and care of the theatre patient. There are separate sections on drug administration and emergency and high dependency care. The book then takes a systems-based approach to the care of patients covering the key concepts which underpin all good nursing practice, including the social and psychological aspects of nursing. Information is included on how to relate the principles of clinical skills to different groups such as the elderly and the mentally ill, which will have relevance to practitioners whether in a hospital or community setting.A unique and comprehensive guide to clinical skills in nursing, the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Skills in Adult Nursing will help nurses and other health care workers to perform clinical skills safely and competently.

While sexuality may not be the primary focus for cancer patients, at some point, whether because of sexual changes or relationship issues, many patients come to acknowledge the effects that cancer and its treatment have had on their sexuality. Although the impacts are frequently similar, significant variation is observed. Some patients experience changes in all phases of sexual response, while others experience none; moreover, the consequences of the effects may be felt differently by patients and partners. Unfortunately, many physicians and health care providers remain insufficiently aware of the impact of cancer on sexuality and/or lack knowledge about the concerns of patients and the available treatments and coping strategies. A further issue is the reticence of physicians to discuss sexuality and the fear of sexologists to talk to patients about cancer. Readers will find this book to be a rich source of help in overcoming these constraints and delivering suitable care to patients.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319431932"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319431935"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 286, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nursing&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2nclDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cancer_Intimacy_and_Sexuality-sample-epub.acsm?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cancer_Intimacy_and_Sexuality-sample-pdf.acsm?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2nclDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vT8qAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "BykhwKADTrg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vT8qAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Study Guide for Essentials of Nursing Research", "subtitle": "Appraising Evidence for Nursing Practice", "authors": ["Denise F.

Increasingly since the 1970s, and more intensively under recent reforms, Canadian health care is the focus of information-supported, professionally based management. In Managing to Nurse, Janet M. Rankin and Marie L. Campbell probe the operation of this new form of hospital and its effect management on nurses and nursing. Written from the nurse's perspective, this institutional ethnography discovers a major transformation in the nature of nursing and associated patient care: the work is now organized according to an accounting logic that embeds a cost-orientation into care-related activities. Rankin and Campbell illustrate how nurses adapt to this new reality just as they, themselves, perpetuate it - how they learn to recognize their adaptations as professionally correct and as an adequate basis for nursing judgement.

The reader is assisted to explore the ethical dimension of nursing practice: what it is and how it can be portrayed, discussed, and analysed within a variety of practice and theoretical contexts. One of the unique contributions of this book is to consider nursing not only in the context of the individual nurse \u2013 patient relationship but also as a social good that is of necessity limited, due to the ultimate limits on the nursing and health care resource. This book will help the reader consider what good nursing looks like, both within the context of limitations on resources and under conditions of scarcity. Indeed, any discussion of ethical issues in nursing should be well grounded in a conceptualisation of nursing that nursing students and practising nursing can recognise, accept and engage with. Nursing, like medicine, social work and teaching has a clear moral aim \u2013 to do good. In the case of nursing to do good for the patient. However it is vital that in the pressurised, constrained health service of the 21st century, we help nurses explore what this might mean for nursing practice and what can reasonably be expected of the individual nurse in terms of good nursing care.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319492506"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319492500"}], "readingModes": {"text":

phenomenological point of view, shedding light on the feelings of suicidal individuals and also those of clinicians. In accordance with the importance that the phenomenological approach attaches to subjectivity and sense of self as the starting points for knowledge, emphasis is placed on the need for the clinician to focus on the subjective experiences of the at-risk individual, to set aside prior assumptions, judgments, or interpretations, and to identify ways of bridging gaps in communication associated with negative emotions. The vital importance of empathy is stressed, drawing attention to the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition. It is widely acknowledged that when a clinician meets a person who wants to die by suicide, the clinician does not fully understand what is going on inside the mind of that individual. This book recognizes that any approach to suicide prevention must promote understanding of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The awareness that it fosters and the innovative perspectives that it presents will appeal to a wide readership.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319479767"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319479768"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 217, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nursing&hl=&cd=54&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-bHg5DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Phenomenology_of_Suicide-sample-epub.acsm?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Phenomenology_of_Suicide-sample-pdf.acsm?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bHg5DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kr_MFpuJNuYC", "etag": "dQS533XWRfc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kr_MFpuJNuYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Nursing: Communication Skills in Practice", "authors": ["Lucy Webb"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2011-02-24", "description": "Nursing students require a unique guide to communication and interpersonal skills to help them succeed on both placement and in academic work.

Overall, the report finds that whilst the NHS has successfully reduced its expenditure on temporary agency staff, the use of temporary staff still remains a key aspect of the ability of NHS trusts to be flexible in order to cover staff vacancies and absence through sickness and to meet fluctuations in activity levels. Many NHS trusts lack robust management information systems to help determine cost-effective staffing levels or to understand their real staffing needs.

Other testing modalities that are discussed include EMG testing, fluoroscopy, and provocative maneuvers. Practical Urodynamics for the Clinician will serve as a very useful and practical resource for physicians and researchers dealing with, and interested in, this complex physiologic testing tool.

The medical humanities address what happens to us when we are affected by a disease and narrative medicine is an interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes the importance of patient narratives in bridging various divides, including those between health care professionals and patients. The book covers the genesis of the medical humanities and of narrative medicine and explores all aspects of their role in improving healthcare. It describes how narrative medicine is therapeutic for the patient, enhances the patient\u2013doctor relationship, and allows the identification, via patients' stories, of the feelings and experiences that are characteristic for each disease. Furthermore, it explains how to use narrative medicine as a real scientific tool. Narrative Medicine will be of value for all caregivers: physicians, nurses, healthcare managers, psychotherapists, counselors, and social workers. \u201cMaria Giulia Marini takes a unique and innovative approach to narrative medicine. She sees it as offering a bridge \u2013 indeed a variety of different bridges \u2013 between clinical care and \u2018humanitas\u2019. With a sensitive use of mythology, literature and metaphor on the one hand, and scientific studies on the other, she shows how the guiding concept of narrative might bring together the fragmented parts of the medical enterprise\u201d.

It is a book which committed ther apists can really use in their practical work with patients. We ther apists need such books. The engagement and enthusiasm must come from us. It is similar to a good cookbook. Admittedly one has to know something about cooking but when learning the secrets of haute cuisine - not just the expensive frills but the real refinement- then theoretical dissertations are not very helpful. In practice com ments like \"you just have to have the right touch\" are useless. Many books are disappointing because the reader cannot learn how to put theory into practice, as the author does not disclose the true secrets of his success, perhaps not really wanting the eager stu dents to \"bake a good cake\" for example. Such is not the case with this book. In the first theoretical chap ter \"The Normal Trunk - Evolutionary and Anatomical Consider ations\" the reader is given information about the significance of the normal anatomical relationships in the development of the body segments: the pelvis, thorax and head. The second chapter, \"Aspects of Trunk Control\", deals with the muscular control of movement within each of these inherently mobile segments. In the terminology of \"Functional Kinetics\" the different types of muscle activities are described, defining the importance of the selective use of the musculature in reaction to the pull of gravity.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642615023"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642615023"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 277, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nursing&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6301.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6301.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DL3uCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6301200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6301200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Right_in_the_Middle-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DL3uCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "A7ocQUa2IQsC", "etag": "ASywG/UlADA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/A7ocQUa2IQsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Pivotal moments in nursing Volume 1", "subtitle": "Leaders who Changed the Path of a Profession", "authors": ["Beth Houser", "Kathy Player"], "publisher": "Sigma Theta Tau", "publishedDate": "2004-01", "description": "This book describes the lives of 12 nurse leaders and the impact they each had on contemporary nursing practice. the leaders come from many domains, academics, acute care, research, public policy, and others.

It considers this from the perspectives of all of the settings in which this group of patients receive nursing care. Globally, a fragility fracture is estimated to occur every 3 seconds. This amounts to 25 000 fractures per day or 9 million per year. The financial costs are reported to be: 32 billion EUR per year in Europe and 20 billon USD in the United States. As the population of China ages, the cost of hip fracture care there is likely to reach 1.25 billion USD by 2020 and 265 billion by 2050 (International Osteoporosis Foundation 2016). Consequently, the need for nursing for patients with fragility fracture across the world is immense. Fragility fracture is one of the foremost challenges for health care providers, and the impact of each one of those expected 9 million hip fractures is significant pain, disability, reduced quality of life, loss of independence and decreased life expectancy. There is a need for coordinated, multi-disciplinary models of care for secondary fracture prevention based on the increasing evidence that such models make a difference. There is also a need to promote and facilitate high quality, evidence-based effective care to those who suffer a fragility fracture with a focus on the best outcomes for recovery, rehabilitation and secondary prevention of further fracture. The care community has to understand better the experience of fragility fracture from the perspective of the patient so that direct improvements in care can be based on the perspectives of the users. This book supports these needs by providing a comprehensive approach to nursing practice in fragility fracture care.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319766812"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319766813"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 158, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zSpgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zSpgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zSpgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nursing&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zSpgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zSpgDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 0, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 0, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zSpgDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zSpgDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api"}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "ALL_PAGES", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zSpgDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "E7wvxAOKT1gC", "etag": "KO23+EMiPUk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/E7wvxAOKT1gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Orthopedic Traumatology - A Resident's Guide", "authors": ["David Ip"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2006-09-15", "description": "In a very concise and extremely well organized manner Orthopedic Traumatology discusses the important principles underlying the management of orthopedic trauma, which has undergone significant changes recently.

McPherson", "Kathryn McPherson"], "publisher": "University of Toronto Press", "publishedDate": "2003-01-01", "description": "Nursing embodies the seemingly timeless characteristics of feminine healing, caring, and nurturing, yet this archetypally female vocation also boasts a distinctive and complex history. Bedside Matters traces four generations of Canadian nurses to explore changes in who became nurses, what work they performed, and how they organized to defend their occupational interests. Whether in the apprenticeship method of the early twentieth century or in the present day restructuring of hospital work, the position of nurses within the health-care system has been structured by class, gender, and ethnic and racial relations. Located between the doctors and untrained or subsidiary patient-care attendants, nurses have struggled to define the boundaries of their occupation vis \u00e0 vis other members of the health-care hierarchy, even as tensions between bedside and administrative nurses created divisions within nursing itself. Focusing on the daily labours of 'ordinary nurses', McPherson argues that the persisting sex-typing of nursing as women's work has meant that gender consistently complicated nursing's easy categorization as either professional or proletariat. Combining archival records and oral histories, the author shows how nurses, in their work, activities, and social and sexual attitudes, sought recognition as skilled workers in the health-care system.

Full-time employment leads to beneficial health effects and being healthy leads to increased chances of full-time employment (Ross and Mirowskay 1995). Employment of disabled people enhances their self-esteem and reduces social isolation (Dougherty 1999). The importance of returning to work for people following amputation the- fore has to be considered. Perhaps the first article about reemployment and problems people may have at work after amputation was published in 1955 (Boynton 1955). In later years, there have been sporadic studies on this topic. Greater interest and more studies about returning to work and problems people have at work following amputation arose in the 1990s and has continued in recent years (Burger and Marinc ?ek 2007). These studies were conducted in different countries on all the five continents, the greatest number being carried out in Europe, mainly in the Netherlands and the UK (Burger and Marinc ?ek 2007). Owing to the different functions of our lower and upper limbs, people with lower limb amputations have different activity limitations and participation restrictions compared to people with upper limb amputations.

Legal issues surrounding genetics, fertility and surrogacy are reviewed in conjunction with the current position on abortion and wrongful deaths.

The new third edition continues to present contemporary issues relevant for Health Science students from the clinical setting through to management and employment, as they apply to each state. Streamlined new edition includes updates to key chapters such as: Chapter 5 Negligence, which has been completely rewritten to discuss negligence by jurisdiction Chapter 8 Manipulation of Life now deals with topical and controversial issues such as abortion, wrongful death, tissue transplants, genetics and infertility Chapter 10: Contractual and Industrial Elements of Professional Practice has been updated to include the most recent changes to Industrial Relations Law, information that is essential for any Health Professional entering into employment. Chapter 11: Statues Controlling Health Service Delivery has been revised with respect to drugs and continues to provide the significant legislation most likely to impact on the daily practice of the health professional namely poisons, mental health legislation, child and elder abuse, and the notification of births and deaths.

It begins with her work to establish the Royal Commission on the Sanitary State of the Army in India, for which she drafted questionnaires, analyzed returns, and did much of the final writing, going on to promote the implementation of its recommendations. In this volume a gradual shift of attention can be seen from the health of the army to that of the civilian population. Famine and epidemics were frequent and closely interrelated occurrences. To combat them, Nightingale recommended a comprehensive set of sanitary measures, and educational and legal reforms, to be overseen by a public health agency. Skilful in implementing the expertise, influence, and power of others, she worked with her impressive network of well-placed collaborators, having them send her information and meet with her back in London. The volume includes Nightingale\u2019s work on the royal commission itself, related correspondence, numerous published pamphlets, articles and letters to the editor, and correspondence with her growing network of viceroys, governors of presidencies, and public health experts. Working with British collaborators, she began this work; over time Nightingale increased her contact with Indian nationals and promoted their work and associations.

Lindquist", "Scott M. Dresden"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2019-08-07", "description": "Care for older adults in Emergency Departments (EDs) has historically been focused on acute medical conditions with little emphasis on geriatric-specific issues. In 2010, emergency departments (EDs) throughout the nation saw almost 130 million patients, 15% of whom were 65 or older. The number of older adults who visit an ED has doubled in the last decade and continues to grow rapidly. Older adults receiving care in an ED are highly likely to be admitted to the hospital, much more so than their younger counterparts. Preventing a hospital admission saves older adults from frequently encountered adverse events, including hospital-acquired delirium, functional status impairment, cognitive loss, and nursing home admission. It is unknown how many older adults are hospitalized for reasons other than acute medical illness, such as functional decline, polypharmacy, progressive dementia, caregiver stress, or unstable living situation. These non-emergent conditions are rarely addressed during a typical ED visit due to lack of resources, significant patient volumes, and the need for rapid turnover of care spaces. The predominant management strategy of emergency physicians to handle these important but not imminently life-threatening geriatric issues is to recommend hospital admission. Northwestern has pioneered the Geriatric Emergency Department through the creation of the Geriatric Emergency Department Innovation model (GEDI), with goals to prevent admissions for older adults by assessing and meeting their geriatric-specific, non-acute care needs in the ED. The GEDI model at Northwestern centers on a multi-disciplinary curriculum composed of clinical, didactic, and practical arms developed by emergency medicine and geriatrics educational experts. In this title, we will present case studies of older adults seen in the Emergency Department through the GEDI model and discuss means of identifying/screening for, diagnosing, and treating geriatric syndromes seen in the emergent care of the older adult patient. In addition, there will be a set of concise \u201ctake-home points\u201d for each case study that will be easy to commit to memory and implement in clinical care of older adults.

Its focus on clinical reasoning - what it is and how it works - provides for a substantial text intended for undergraduate and graduate nursing students who are learning critical and acute care, for educators teaching clinical reasoning, and for those seeking to improve systems of care and leadership in clinical practice. Revised and updated to current pedagogy and practice needs, this second edition will expand upon the success of the first edition and become a classic on its own. Originally based on a three-year research project with interviews and observations of 205 RNs and APNs in critical care, emergency departments, perioperative areas, and emergency transport services, the second edition includes new interviews from acute care, critical care and perioperative nurses, and new commentary, among other improvements. Attention is paid to current IOM and nursing guidelines for system approaches to patient safety, with education and leadership implications described throughout. The authors bring to the second edition over a decade of experience using the first edition in the classroom and in-service settings.

This model includes: an environment of care designed to promote improved function for older patients; an interdisciplinary team that works together to identify/address the vulnerabilities of the older patients; nursing care plans for prevention of disability; early planning to help prepare the patient to return home and a review of medical care to prevent iatrogenic illness. Acute Care for Elders: A Model for Interdisciplinary Care is an essential new resource aimed at assisting providers in developing and sustaining an ACE program. The interdisciplinary approach provides an introduction to the key vulnerabilities of older adults and defines the lessons learned from the Acute Care for Elders model. Expertly written chapters describe critical aspects of ACE: the interdisciplinary approach and the focus on function. The fundamental principles of ACE described in this book will further assist hospital leaders to develop, implement, sustain and disseminate the Acute Care for Elders model of care.
