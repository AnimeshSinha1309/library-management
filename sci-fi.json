Still acclaimed as one of the most remarkable and important motion pictures ever made, 2001: A Space Odyssey depicted the first contacts between humanity and extraterrestrial intelligence. The movie was the product of a singular collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and science fiction visionary Arthur C. Clarke. Fresh off the success of his cold war satire Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick wanted to make the first truly first-rate science fiction film. Drawing from Clarke\u2019s ideas and with one of the author\u2019s short stories as the initial inspiration, their bold vision benefited from pioneering special effects that still look extraordinary today, even in an age of computer-generated images. In Space Odyssey, author, artist, and award-winning filmmaker Michael Benson \u201cdelivers expert inside stuff\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle) from his extensive research of Kubrick\u2019s and Clarke\u2019s archives. He has had the cooperation of Kubrick\u2019s widow, Christiane, and interviewed most of the key people still alive who worked on the film. Drawing also from other previously unpublished interviews, Space Odyssey provides a 360-degree view of the film from its genesis to its legacy, including many previously untold stories.

A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready? It's the year 2044, and the real world has become an ugly place. We're out of oil. We've wrecked the climate. Famine, poverty, and disease are widespread. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his creation. For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles are based in the culture of the late twentieth century.

Particular attention to the significance of migrant women's and children's experiences in a context of seeking relief from personal and social ills gives Sharp's investigation importance for gender studies as well as for studies in medical anthropology, Africa and Madagascar, the politics of culture, and religion and ritual.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Y7cwDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Ringworld", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["Larry Niven"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 342, "ratingsCount": 72, "averageRating": 3.5, "publisher": "Random House Digital, Inc.", "publishedDate": "1970", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xKy-ZPuz3bsC&dq=name:Ringworld+(Ringworld,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xKy-ZPuz3bsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "A two-headed creature and a large redfurred carnivore are among the members of a party which arrives to explore a mysterious world fabricated in the shape of a ring", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xKy-ZPuz3bsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Using Solaris 9", "categories": ["Computers"], "authors": ["Radhika Girisan", "Tanuj Jain"], "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 639, "ratingsCount": 1, "averageRating": 5, "publisher": "Que Publishing", "publishedDate": "2002", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pCRbEzYsNNEC&pg=PA57&dq=name:Solaris&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pCRbEzYsNNEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "language": "en", "description": "Annotation Provides administrators with in depth coverage of the #1 UNIX operating system, including features new to the popular version 9.

Named the best series of all time by the Hugo Awards, the Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov unquestionably comprise one of the great masterworks of science fiction, unsurpassed for its unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building. Now, all seven volumes are together for the first time in this essential eBook bundle: FOUNDATION FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE SECOND FOUNDATION FOUNDATION\u2019S EDGE FOUNDATION AND EARTH PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION FORWARD THE FOUNDATION For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future\u2014a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humanity, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire\u2014both scientists and scholars\u2014and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls this sanctuary the Foundation. But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. And mankind\u2019s last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and live as slaves\u2014or take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction. Praise for Isaac Asimov and his Foundation series \u201cA true polymath, a superb rationalist, an exciting and accessible writer in both fiction and nonfiction, Isaac Asimov was simply a master of all he surveyed.\u201d\u2014Greg Bear \u201cAsimov served wondrous meals-of-the-mind to a civilization that was starved for clear thinking about the future. To this day, his visions spice our ongoing dinner-table conversation about human destiny.\u201d\u2014David Brin \u201cIsaac was still in his teens when I met him, a fan of mine before I was a fan of his. Writing for John W. Campbell back in the famous \u2018golden age of science fiction,\u2019 he became one of the founders of our field. With the Robot stories and the Foundation stories, he helped to shape science fiction as we know it.\u201d\u2014Jack Williamson \u201cI grew up on the ABC\u2019s of science fiction\u2014Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke.

Contributors move beyond the recent wave of \"masculinity in crisis\" arguments to provide sophisticated and often surprising insight into accessible films. Chapters are arranged in four sections: \"Performing Masculinity\" includes a discussion of Adam Sandler and movies such as Milk; \"Patriarchal Problems\" looks at issues of fathers from directors such as Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, and David Fincher; \"Exceptional Sexualities\" examines male love and sex through movies like Brokeback Mountain and Wedding Crashers; and \"Facing Race\" explores masculinity through race in film. Sean Penn, Jackie Chan, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and Philip Seymour Hoffman are some of the actors included in these analyses, while themes considered include police thrillers, psychotic killers, gay tensions, fashion sense, and the burgeoning \"bromance\" genre. Taken together, the essays in Millennial Masculinity shed light on the high stakes of masculine roles in contemporary American cinema. Film and television scholars as well as readers interested in gender and sexuality in film will appreciate this timely collection.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TLnDAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Foundation", "categories": ["Religion"], "authors": ["D.

Jim Holden is an officer on an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew discover a derelict ship called the Scopuli, they suddenly find themselves in possession of a deadly secret. A secret that someone is willing to kill for, and on an unimaginable scale. War is coming to the system, unless Jim can find out who abandoned the ship and why.

It is so beautifully written and the construction of the narrative is masterful.' Emma Newman, acclaimed author of Planetfall Set in the 21st century - a number of decades from now - The Sparrow is the story of a charismatic Jesuit priest and talented linguist, Emilio Sandoz, who - in response to a remarkable radio signal from the depths of space - leads a scientific mission to make first contact with an extraterrestrial culture. In the true tradition of Jesuit adventurers before him, Sandoz and his companions are prepared to endure isolation, suffering - even death - but nothing can prepare them for the civilisation they encounter. Or for the tragic misunderstanding that brings the mission to a devastating end. Once considered a living saint, Sandoz returns alone to Earth horrifically maimed, both physically and spiritually, the mission's sole survivor - only to be blamed for the mission's failure and accused of heinous crimes. Written in clean, effortless prose and peopled with memorable characters who never lose their humanity or humour, The Sparrow is a powerful, haunting fiction - a tragic but ultimately triumphant novel about the nature of faith, of love and what it means to be 'human' and widely considered to be a classic of the genre.", "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nvxKIlcLRXEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Use of Weapons", "categories": ["Fiction"], "authors": ["Iain M.

Now it is dying. Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future\u2014a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humanity, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire\u2014both scientists and scholars\u2014and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations.

Wells\u2019s haunting classic, one of his most intriguing and visionary novels. Living in the late nineteenth century and facing the impact of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, Wells wrote this chilling masterpiece about the characteristics of beasts blurring as the animals turn into men.

But as the brutally enforced order on Moreau\u2019s island dissolves, the true consequences of his experiments emerge, and his creations revert to beasts more shocking than nature could devise. A genius of his time, H. G. Wells foresaw the use of what he called the \u201catom bomb,\u201d the practice of gene-splicing, and men landing on the moon. Now, when these have become part of everyday life, his dark fable serves as a compelling reminder of the horrors that reckless experiments with nature can produce. With an Introduction by Nita A.

America is a place of chaos, where violence rules and only the rich and powerful are safe. Lauren Olamina, a young woman with the extraordinary power to feel the pain of others as her own, records everything she sees of this broken world in her journal. Then, one terrible night, everything alters beyond recognition, and Lauren must make her voice heard for the sake of those she loves. Soon, her vision becomes reality and her dreams of a better way to live gain the power to change humanity forever. All that you touch, You Change. All that you Change, Changes you.

On each day of the week that follows, Don Juan describes the adventures he experienced on that same day a week earlier. The adventures are erotic, but Handke's Don Juan is more pursued than pursuer. What makes his accounts riveting are the remarkable evocations of places and people, and the nature of his narration. Don Juan: His Own Version is, above all, a book about storytelling and its ability to burst the ordinary boundaries of time and space.

Ann Leckie is the first author to win the Arthur C. Clarke, the Nebula and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in the same year. They made me kill thousands, but I only have one target now. The Radch are conquerors to be feared - resist and they'll turn you into a 'corpse soldier' - one of an army of dead prisoners animated by a warship's AI mind. Whole planets are conquered by their own people. The colossal warship called The Justice of Toren has been destroyed - but one ship-possessed soldier has escaped the devastation. Used to controlling thousands of hands, thousands of mouths, The Justice now has only two hands, and one mouth with which to tell her tale. But one fragile, human body might just be enough to take revenge against those who destroyed her.
