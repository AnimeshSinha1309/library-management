Richardson began experimenting with military and police dogs in 1898, and in 1910 began petitioning for a British military dog program. He finally received official approval with support of officers who were unofficially, and successfully, using his dogs in the field. Over 2000 dogs were trained and sent to the front to work as Red Cross dogs, messengers, sentries and patrol dogs--the lives saved were estimated in thousands. Cummins recounts not only Richardson's struggle, but also the history of war dogs through the ages. This book formed the basis for the documentary Dogs of War on the BBC series Inside Out, broadcast in 2006.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781550592481"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1550592483"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 210, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Colonel_Richardson_s_Airedales.html?hl=&id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "RxucBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "YAtYcjsIT68", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RxucBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "K9 Personal Protection", "subtitle": "A Manual for Training Reliable Protection Dogs", "authors": ["Resi Gerritsen", "Ruud Haak"], "publisher": "Dog Training Press", "publishedDate": "2014-12-22", "description": "Create a safe, successful K9 training program that results in reliable protection dogs.

His techniques have worked for hundreds of dogs, and have been used and adapted by many skilled trainers and decoys for their individual circumstances. K9 Aggression Control provides a flexible approach to aggression control that is rooted in obedience training. You may be someone who uses a muzzle, sees a role for toys and games, and works with a decoy who likes to drop the sleeve, or you might not want a muzzle, toy, or dropped sleeve anywhere near your dog -- either way this book has options for you. It details techniques and variations so you can choose the options you prefer. Dr. Mackenzie also gives decoys sound advice on controlling a dog's excitement level, working with handlers, and making the best use of equipment. A new chapter in this revised and updated edition shows you how to train dogs to indicate a person's location without biting -- essential for the search and rescue trainer and a real plus for modern police forces looking for ways to reduce liability.

Expressed feelings often go unvalidated when in truth, pet loss is a unique form of grief that can be quite intense and debilitating, increasing an individual's vulnerability to subsequent stress and leaving them feeling isolated and misunderstood. Pet loss needs to be addressed by therapists and others in the helping professions, to better enable them to help their clients through the loss of their companion animals.

In these pages you\u2019ll also meet Maya and Zuni, two orphaned baby hummingbirds who hatched from eggs the size of navy beans, and who are little more than air bubbles fringed with feathers. Their lives hang precariously in the balance\u2014but with human help, they may one day conquer the sky. Snowball is a cockatoo whose dance video went viral on YouTube and who\u2019s now teaching schoolchildren how to dance. You\u2019ll meet Harris\u2019s hawks named Fire and Smoke. And you\u2019ll come to know and love a host of other avian characters who will change your mind forever about who birds really are. Each of these birds shows a different and utterly surprising aspect of what makes a bird a bird\u2014and these are the lessons of Birdology: that birds are far stranger, more wondrous, and at the same time more like us than we might have dared to imagine. In Birdology, beloved author of The Good Good Pig Sy Montgomery explores the essence of the otherworldly creatures we see every day. By way of her adventures with seven birds\u2014wild, tame, exotic, and common\u2014she weaves new scientific insights and narrative to reveal seven kernels of bird wisdom. The first lesson of Birdology is that, no matter how common they are, Birds Are Individuals, as each of Montgomery\u2019s distinctive Ladies clearly shows. In the leech-infested rain forest of Queensland, you\u2019ll come face to face with a cassowary\u2014a 150-pound, man-tall, flightless bird with a helmet of bone on its head and a slashing razor-like toenail with which it (occasionally) eviscerates people\u2014proof that Birds Are Dinosaurs. You\u2019ll learn from hawks that Birds Are Fierce; from pigeons, how Birds Find Their Way Home; from parrots, what it means that Birds Can Talk; and from 50,000 crows who moved into a small city\u2019s downtown, that Birds Are Everywhere. They are the winged aliens who surround us. Birdology explains just how very \"other\" birds are: Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. They are covered with modified scales, which are called feathers. Their bones are hollow. Their bodies are permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs. Yet despite birds\u2019 and humans\u2019 disparate evolutionary paths, we share emotional and intellectual abilities that allow us to communicate and even form deep bonds. When we begin to comprehend who birds really are, we deepen our capacity to approach, understand, and love these otherworldly creatures. And this, ultimately, is the priceless lesson of Birdology: it communicates a heartfelt fascination and awe for birds and restores our connection to these complex, mysterious fellow creatures.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1416570160"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416570165"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.4.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Birdology.html?hl=&id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Birdology-sample-epub.acsm?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "zi_bbk9kUNAC", "etag": "e2qOj6lwiaI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zi_bbk9kUNAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Book of the Bitch", "subtitle": "A Complete Guide to Understanding and Caring for Bitches", "authors": ["J.

Cats are getting kidney transplants. Could they one day be fellow citizens? Cats and dogs were once wild animals. Today, they are family members and surrogate children. A little over a century ago, pets didn't warrant the meager legal status of property. Now, they have more rights and protections than any other animal in the country. Some say they're even on the verge of becoming legal persons. How did we get here\u2014and what happens next? In this fascinating exploration of the changing status of dogs and cats in society, pet lover and award-winning journalist David Grimm explores the rich and surprising history of our favorite companion animals. He treks the long and often torturous path from their wild origins to their dark days in the middle ages to their current standing as the most valued animals on Earth. As he travels across the country\u2014riding along with Los Angeles detectives as they investigate animal cruelty cases, touring the devastation of New Orleans in search of the orphaned pets of Hurricane Katrina, and coming face-to-face with wolves and feral cats\u2014Grimm reveals the changing social attitudes that have turned pets into family members, and the remarkable laws and court cases that have elevated them to quasi citizens. The journey to citizenship isn't a smooth one, however. As Grimm finds, there's plenty of opposition to the rising status of cats and dogs. From scientists and farmers worried that our affection for pets could spill over to livestock and lab rats to philosophers who say the only way to save society is to wipe cats and dogs from the face of the earth, the battle lines are being drawn. We are entering a new age of pets\u2014one that is fundamentally transforming our relationship with these animals and reshaping the very fabric of society.

An attempt to understand human attachment to the canis familiaris in terms of reciprocity and empathy, Melancholia\u2019sDog tackles such difficult concepts as intimacy and kinship with dogs, the shame associated with identification with their suffering, and the reasons for the profound mourning over their deaths. In addition to philosophy and psychoanalysis, Alice A. Kuzniar turns to the insights and images offered by the literary and visual arts\u2014the short stories of Ivan Turgenev and Franz Kafka, the novels of J. M. Coetzee and Rebecca Brown, the photography of Sally Mann and William Wegman, and the artwork of David Hockney and Sue Coe. Without falling into sentimentality or anthropomorphization, Kuzniar honors and learns from our canine companions, above all attending to the silences and sadness brought on by the effort to represent the dog as perfectly and faithfully as it is said to love.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226465784"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0226465780"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 215, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=13Ocz67oOlcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=13Ocz67oOlcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=13Ocz67oOlcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=13Ocz67oOlcC&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Melancholia_s_Dog.html?hl=&id=13Ocz67oOlcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Melancholia_s_Dog-sample-epub.acsm?id=13Ocz67oOlcC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=13Ocz67oOlcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0sUQJHGzblwC", "etag": "W0x7sj758hs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0sUQJHGzblwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Animal Reiki", "subtitle": "Using Energy to Heal the Animals in Your Life", "authors": ["Elizabeth Fulton", "Kathleen Prasad"], "publisher": "Ulysses Press", "publishedDate": "2006-04-05", "description": "Two Reiki masters explore Reiki's powerful noninvasive energy treatments for animals, including step-by-step instructions for treating domestic, exotic, and wild animals and stories of their own healing experiences to demonstrate the effectiveness of this alternative method.

Crystal healing is as effective and potent a healing art today as it was in the time of the ancient Egyptians. It is even more effective with animals than for humans, and any pet owner or animal caregiver can easily learn to master the basic techniques of choosing and cleansing crystals, dowsing and crystal massage, making crystal essences, and the use of crystal layouts in healing. Crystal Healing for Animals explains these methods in plain and simple language and will be useful for beginners and experienced crystal users alike. Crystal healing allows us to take an active role in the health of our animal companions, in the sure knowledge that we can do no wrong. Crystals have a healing energy that is powerful and profound, but is completely safe and gentle. Take a guided tour of thirty of the most commonly used and effective healing crystal and gemstones, showing how you can easily and inexpensively build up a collection that will last a life time and go on providing healing support to your animal friends as the years go by. Animal problems covered include: abuse and trauma, allergies, bereavement and grief, hyperactivity, constipation, inflammation, low immunity, muscle strains and pains, post-surgical recovery, stress, training problems and animal/human relationships, and much more. This book also contains special sections on training and animal rescue, showing the role that crystals can play in this context.

What about quantum teleportation to catch squirrels before they climb out of reach? Where are all the universes in which Chad drops steak on the floor? And what about the bunnies made of cheese that ought to be appearing out of nothing in the backyard? With great humor and clarity, Chad Orzel explains to Emmy, and to human readers, just what quantum mechanics is and how it works -- and why, although you can't use it to catch squirrels or eat steak, it's still bizarre, amazing, and important to every dog and human. Follow along as Chad and Emmy discuss the central elements of quantum theory, from particles that behave like waves and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to entanglement (\"spooky action at a distance\") and virtual particles. Along the way, they discuss the history of the theory, such as the experiments that discovered that electrons are waves and particles at the same time, and Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr's decades-long debate over what quantum theory really meant (Einstein may have been smarter, but Bohr was right more often). Don't get caught looking less informed than Emmy. How to Teach Physics to Your Dog will show you the universe that lies beneath everyday reality, in all its randomness, uncertainty, and wonder. \"Forget Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat,\" says Emmy, \"quantum physics is all about dogs.\" And once you see quantum physics explained to a dog, you'll never see the world the same way again.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416579014"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "141657901X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Teach_Quantum_Physics_to_Your_Dog.html?hl=&id=K3rdKqmBPacC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_to_Teach_Quantum_Physics_to_Your_Dog-sample-epub.acsm?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kRXbAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "h9ve/B56CCY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kRXbAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Canine Behavior", "subtitle": "A Photo Illustrated Handbook", "publisher": "Dogwise Publishing", "publishedDate": "2012-12-12", "description": "<b>The ebook version of this book is FULL color throughout!</b> <a href=\"http://dogwise.com/images/dogworldtop12.jpg\">A Dog World Top 12 Training and Behavior Book - 2010!</a><br><br>Dogs have deliberate, subtle, and often humorous ways of expressing themselves.

You'll see signs of mild stress, which range from a paw lift to lip licking to blinking. A yawn may simply mean a dog is tired, or indicate stress. Stretching can also be a sign of stress. Dogs are constantly communicating non-verbally.

He has a plane ticket to South America, a teaching position in a prestigious Argentine boarding school, and endless summer holidays. He even has a motorbike, Che Guevara style. What he doesn't need is a pet. What he really doesn't need is a pet penguin. Set against Argentina's turbulent years following the collapse of the corrupt Per\u00f3nist regime, this is the heart-warming story of Juan Salvador the penguin, rescued by Tom from an oil slick in Uruguay just days before a new term. When the bird refuses to leave Tom's side, the young teacher has no choice but to smuggle it across the border, through customs, and back to school.

A growing demand for lifestyle blocks, in Australia and overseas, is fuelling an interest in the quieter, smaller breeds of cattle which have particular appeal as they are more manageable to control and maintain. Small Cattle for Small Farms is ideal for those people considering buying a small farm for lifestyle or commercial purposes. Written in response to the many questions the author was asked by those seeking to purchase small cattle, this practical and easy to understand guide provides an excellent introduction to small farming. The book assumes no prior experience with cattle, and covers all the basics to help you set up your small farm, including: types of cattle available, how to select your stock and care for them, stocking rates, fencing needs, vaccination requirements, methods of identification, and government requirements for land and stockowners. For those wishing to show their cattle, there is a chapter explaining how to prepare for competitions. A section on marketing details how to make a successful entry into the commercial beef industry, and a list of cattle organisations directs readers to more specific information for their chosen breeds.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780643099562"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0643099565"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 168, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unvjUiyDCx8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2081, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2081, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&rdid=book-unvjUiyDCx8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2081000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2081000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Cattle_for_Small_Farms-sample-epub.acsm?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Cattle_for_Small_Farms-sample-pdf.acsm?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lqotLwbtkmUC", "etag": "nfmAGEqbxMU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lqotLwbtkmUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Heroes of the High Seas", "authors": ["J.

Elementary-school teacher Diane Trull\u2019s life-defining moment happened when her fourth-grade reading class saw a photo of a cardboard box overflowing with homeless puppies. Trull was no stranger to rescuing abandoned animals. She and her husband Mark had made it their mission to find permanent homes for stray dogs and cats. Now her young students were determined to save these lost pups and others like them. And in that moment, the Dalhart Animal Wellness Group and Sanctuary\u2014known as DAWGS\u2014was born. How Trull and her fourth graders started their own animal shelter is a story of dedication, commitment, and perseverance. In this eye-opening, deeply personal book, Trull describes the challenges they faced, from rescuing and caring for the animals to teaching children about compassion and responsibility, to facing local interests opposed to having a shelter in their town. She shares inspiring stories about animals and animal lovers of all ages in this moving story of hope and compassion. DAWGS is a testament to how love and a strong measure of determination can offer second chances\u2014one animal, one child, and one day at a time.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780806540351"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0806540354"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Pets"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1195.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 597.87, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-GduVDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1195740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 597870000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/DAWGS-sample-epub.acsm?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/DAWGS-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GduVDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZoqyZ63nnQEC", "etag": "POegwDcDqbc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZoqyZ63nnQEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "James Herriot's Dog Stories", "authors": ["James Herriot"], "publisher": "Pan Macmillan", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28", "description": "As a little boy, climbing through the lochs and mountains of Argyll with his Irish Setter Don, all James Herriot wanted to be was a \u2018dog doctor\u2019 so he could care for man\u2019s best friend.

Entertaining and Educational Stories About Rescue Dogs and Cats", "authors": ["Miranda McAdams"], "publisher": "AuthorHouse", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11", "description": "This book details the true stories of the author\u2019s and her husband\u2019s many dogs and cats\u2014from Lizzie, who loved to be dressed up as a witch and give out Halloween treats--to Lucky, whose life was saved just in time--to Anton, who survived distemper, a disease that kills many dogs and cats. All of the animals featured in this book came from animal rescue groups and shelters, with most of them coming from out-of-state kill shelters. For the most part, these animals had problematic behaviors, and were adults, except for the two puppies, Lucky and Anton. Some of these animals growled as their main form of communication to both humans and dogs alike and many of the male dogs marked or were incontinent indoors. Most of the animals needed obedience and leash training, and some dogs exhibited aggression over food, toys, and space. The growling, marking, lack of obedience to basic commands, absence of leash training, and aggressive tendencies all had made these otherwise good-natured animals unattractive to potential and first-time adopters. Another issue that surfaced was the fact that black animals are often overlooked or even avoided by adopters. The chapter, entitled \u201cAshley, the Black Dog,\u201d addresses this unfortunate and widespread prejudice toward black dogs and cats. The author found that it was extremely rewarding to adopt rescue dogs. Although they were difficult at times, she found them to be interesting, challenging, and loveable. She also felt that they had taught her a lot about how to handle dogs with their particular problems. The author also loved adopting the less complicated dogs\u2014the ones who just eat, play, sleep, and lick your hand\u2014like Ashley, Lucky, Pooky, and Gumby. These dogs may not have been the most intelligent dogs, but because of their gentle natures, they got along well with, and balanced out, the author\u2019s more difficult and aggressive dogs.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781491871553"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1491871555"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 100, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Pets"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 808.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 404.15, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hUBmAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 808300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 404150000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/I_Never_Met_a_Dog_I_Didn_t_Like-sample-epub.acsm?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/I_Never_Met_a_Dog_I_Didn_t_Like-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hUBmAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nXk5AQAAQBAJ", "etag": "nn688kYZAd8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nXk5AQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend", "subtitle": "A Training Manual for Dog Owners", "authors": ["Monks of New Skete"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2001-05-15", "description": "For more than a quarter century, How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend has been the standard against which all other dog-training books have been measured.

This tale is about manners and how children react to them. Tabitha Twitchit, the cat, invites friends for tea. In order to prepare, she washes and dresses her three kittens for the party, but unwisely let them play in the garden while she gets on with the preparations. Within moments the kittens have soiled and lost their clothes while scampering about the garden. The Puddle-Duck family, Mr Drake, Jemima and Rebeccah, pick up the clothes and put them on. Then waddle off to the pond to swim. Tabitha comes out to call the children in and is \"affronted\" by what she finds. She sends the kittens to bed, and tells her friends the kittens have the measles.

In this book, I will show you how some successful reef aquarium hobbyists are able to fill their tanks with corals that are already proven to grow well in their tanks. These aquarists are also able to trade with other hobbyists to acquire some of the corals that are grow best for them, and many are even able to use these secrets to make a little money on the side.

There's also a growing population of several thousand, mostly mainlanders. But a mere 55 years ago, Easter Island had none of these. In 1952, Dar\u00edo Verdugo-Binimelis, an idealistic Chilean physician, and his wife, Adriana, pulled up stakes and brought their four young sons to Easter Island for what would become an incredible adventure and educational experience for the family. Appointed by the Chilean Ministry of Health to serve a two-year stint as the island's sole physician, Dr. Verdugo had the responsibility for the health of the island population of about eight hundred, and he also affectionately ministered to the patients isolated in the islands leper colony. Dr. Verdugo has written a lyrical memoir of culture shock melting into affection for the native \"Pascuenses\" and their simple, carefree culture. He reflects on the day-to-day struggles amid stunning natural beauty and on strengthened family ties and deep friendships reinforced by the profound isolation of this tiny island sitting by itself in the middle of the vast South Pacific. Life and Solitude in Easter Island adds a unique personal and family perspective to the growing body of Easter Island literature, and complements the material found in scholarly texts or in tourist guides. This is an updated English edition of the original Spanish-language memoir, Vida y Soledad en Isla de Pascua, published in Chile in 1999.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781434319159"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1434319156"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 128, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m6CcVUhlCoIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m6CcVUhlCoIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m6CcVUhlCoIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m6CcVUhlCoIC&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Hope_for_Healing_Liver_Disease_in_Your_D.html?hl=&id=m6CcVUhlCoIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=m6CcVUhlCoIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ym_ZDgAAQBAJ", "etag": "QyG6YXut/p4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ym_ZDgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Fabulous Finn", "subtitle": "The Brave Police Dog Who Came Back from the Brink", "authors": ["Dave Wardell"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2018-02-08", "description": "THE TOP TEN BESTSELLER: The Inspirational Life of Finn, Britain's Bravest Dog, Winner of the 2017 Daily Mirror Animal Hero of the Year Award and Star of Britain's Got Talent 2019 Hertfordshire, October 5th 2016. At around 2 a.m., PC Dave Wardell and his dog, PD Finn, were trying to apprehend a robbery suspect when he turned around and attacked them. Finn was stabbed with a ten-inch-bladed knife, both through his chest, via his armpit and then - the knife bound for Dave - through the top of his head. Finn no doubt saved Dave's life, but the race was on to try and save Finn's. Dave Wardell's heartfelt memoir charts an incredible journey of friendship and loyalty. It is a celebration of the bond between one man and his dog, from when Dave collected Finn from his kennels at just nine months old, all the way through to Finn's recent and hard-earned retirement. The book charts the career of a highly trained, highly decorated dog. In his time on the job Finn tracked offenders of all kinds; found missing children; tackled armed offenders; saved lives. But Finn isn't just a police dog - he's also a cherished family pet and this is his remarkable, life-affirming story.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781786489081"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1786489082"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 483.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 338.66, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 483800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 338660000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Fabulous_Finn-sample-epub.acsm?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ym_ZDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "H2ORDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "UAsRcI95KD8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/H2ORDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Building a Grouse Dog", "subtitle": "From Puppy to Polished Performer", "authors": ["Craig Doherty"], "publisher": "Wilderness Adventures Press", "publishedDate": "2019-04-10", "description": "Building a Grouse Dog: From Puppy to Polished Performer by Craig Doherty, is the most comprehensive, how-to manual there is for taking an eight-week-old little squirmer of any pointing breed and turning him or her into that most coveted game bird finder there is: a finished grouse dog. Unlike many general pointing-dog training books, this one concentrates on one species \u2013 the ruffed grouse. Grouse are notorious for their caginess, their wariness, and their difficulty in being pinned down so a hunter can get close enough to flush and shoot. It takes a dog that has been trained nearly from birth to handle that task, and no one knows how to do it better than Craig Doherty. Craig was the driving force behind Field Trial Magazine, is a columnist for The Pointing Dog Journal, regularly competes in grouse trials throughout the Northeast, professionally trains grouse dogs for clients from all over the country, and \u2013 this is important \u2013 guides grouse hunters using his own dogs trained in his outstanding methods; important because paying clients need results, and those results can only come by following dogs that know the game. A number of how-to training books tell you what to do from beginning to end; but if you have started your own training, run into problems, and consult the literature, many times you\u2019ll find that the advice is something along the lines of, \u201cWell, you messed up because you didn\u2019t do X, Y, and Z. Remember that so you won\u2019t ruin your next dog.\u201d Not Craig \u2013 if you have run into a snag with your current dog, Craig tells you what to do to get past it and on with the dog\u2019s completed training.

White (1899 1985) is best known for his children's books, Charlotte's Web, Stuart Little, and The Trumpet of the Swan. Columnist for The New Yorker for over half a century and co-author of Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, White hit his stride as an American literary icon when he began publishing his 'One Man's Meat' columns from his saltwater farm on the coast of Maine. In E. B. White on Dogs, his granddaughter and manager of his literary estate, Martha White, has compiled the best and funniest of his essays, poems, letters, and sketches depicting over a dozen of White's various canine companions. Featured here are favorite essays such as 'Two Letters, Both Open,' where White takes on the Internal Revenue Service, and also 'Bedfellows,' with its 'fraudulent reports'; from White's ignoble old dachshund, Fred. ('I just saw an eagle go by. It was carrying a baby.') From The New Yorker's 'The Talk of the Town' are some little-known Notes and Comment pieces covering dog shows, sled dog races, and the trials and tribulations of city canines, chief among them a Scotty called Daisy who was kicked out of Schrafft's, arrested, and later run down by a Yellow Cab, prompting The New Yorker to run her 'Obituary.' Some previously unpublished photographs from the E. B. White Estate show the family dogs, from the first collie, to various labs, Scotties, dachshunds, half-breeds, and mutts, all well-loved.

Sometimes rural idyll, sometimes hell on earth, Paul\u2019s life in rural Kent has been shared over the years with some very vocal pigs, a mad cow, various rescued barn owls, the world\u2019s most sadistic geese and Christine the psychotic sheep \u2013 among many other animal waifs and strays. And of course Paul tells the stories of the dogs in his life \u2013 including the tiny chihuahua/Jack Russell cross with Napoleonic ambitions, Eddie, Miss Olga, Bullseye, Louis, Boycie and, of course, Buster, the greatest canine star since Lassie. In addition, Paul shares some of his favourite recipes, explores country lore and superstitions, and extols the benefits of growing your own vegetables, herbs and fruit. This is a warts-and-all account of country living, as far removed from the bright lights of celebrity as you could ever imagine. The trials and tribulations Paul experienced on moving to deepest darkest Kent as a dyed-in-the-wool city dweller are every bit as hilarious and eventful as you would think. He had a lot of new skills to learn, and fast: everything from how to churn your own butter and how to birth a lamb to the best way to lure a cow out of your kitchen while naked from the waist down.

In the last few decades, a wealth of new information has emerged about who animals are\u2014intelligent, aware, and empathetic. Studies show that animals are astounding beings with intelligence, emotions, intricate communications networks, and myriad abilities. In Animalkind, Ingrid Newkirk and Gene Stone present these findings in a concise and awe-inspiring way, detailing a range of surprising discoveries: that geese fall in love and stay with a partner for life, that fish \u201csing\u201d underwater, and that elephants use their trunks to send subsonic signals, alerting other herds to danger miles away. Newkirk and Stone pair their tour of the astounding lives of animals with a guide to the exciting new tools that allow humans to avoid using or abusing animals as we once did. They show readers what they can do in their everyday lives to ensure that the animal world is protected from needless harm. Whether it\u2019s medicine, product testing, entertainment, clothing, or food, there are now better options to all the uses animals once served in human life. We can substitute warmer, lighter faux fleece for wool, choose vegan versions of everything from shrimp to sausage and milk to marshmallows, reap the benefits of medical research that no longer requires monkeys to be caged in laboratories, and scrap captive orca exhibits and elephant rides for virtual reality and animatronics. Animalkind is a fascinating study of why our fellow living beings deserve our respect, and moreover, the steps every reader can take to put this new understanding into action.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781501198564"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1501198564"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.4.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 869.66, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 434.83, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-isGeDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 869660000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 434830000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Animalkind-sample-epub.acsm?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=isGeDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "OLAo9o4zhNMC", "etag": "P9TaXufZDCk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/OLAo9o4zhNMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Lost Dogs", "subtitle": "Michael Vick's Dogs and Their Tale of Rescue and Redemption", "authors": ["Jim Gorant"], "publisher": "Penguin", "publishedDate": "2011-09-06", "description": "An inspiring story of survival and our powerful bond with man's best friend, in the aftermath of the nation's most notorious case of animal cruelty. Animal lovers and sports fans were shocked when the story broke about NFL player Michael Vick's brutal dog fighting operation. But what became of the dozens of dogs who survived? As acclaimed writer Jim Gorant discovered, their story is the truly newsworthy aspect of this case. Expanding on Gorant's Sports Illustrated cover story, The Lost Dogs traces the effort to bring Vick to justice and turns the spotlight on these infamous pit bulls, which were saved from euthanasia by an outpouring of public appeals coupled with a court order that Vick pay nearly a million dollars in \"restitution\" to the dogs. As an ASPCA-led team evaluated each one, they found a few hardened fighters, but many more lovable, friendly creatures desperate for compassion. In The Lost Dogs, we meet these amazing animals, a number of which are now living in loving homes, while some even work in therapy programs: Johnny Justice participates in Paws for Tales, which lets kids get comfortable with reading aloud by reading to dogs; Leo spends three hours a week with cancer patients and troubled teens. At the heart of the stories are the rescue workers who transformed the pups from victims of animal cruelty into healing caregivers themselves, unleashing priceless hope.

When Stephen Mackenzie started his career training police service dogs, trainers relied on pain to teach dogs what was expected of them, and motivation was limited to their love of biting on one hand and their desire to avoid painful consequences on the other. The idea that aggressive dogs could learn in non-compulsive ways was slow to take root but is now widely accepted. Mackenzie describes several different approaches for training dogs in aggression control and teaching them to release the decoy without using compulsion. He explains in detail the use of the muzzle, the self out, and various toys and games, so trainers can use the techniques they prefer.

How Dogs Think unravels the mystery of what a dog can understand and how much dogs can learn. World-renowned dog expert Stanley Coren explores the thought processes of dogs, describes how dogs solve problems, explains the depths and limits of their thinking and examines the kind of concepts which dogs can and cannot deal with. Along with practical advice for people who want to improve their dog's learning ability and working intelligence, How Dogs Think will answer such questions as: Do dogs have a notion of time? To what extent do dogs understand what you say? How sharp are their senses? What do they see and hear? Do dogs have a sense of music, humour, empathy, guilt or love?

A Matter of Grace is the true story of a tiny dog and her gigantic influence on those she met along the way. Mattie's story is filled with humorous and touching accounts of her healing from deadly mange, living with the menagerie of animals on the farm, walking with her master on paths he fondly remembered, and bringing a message of hope and optimism to everyone she met from the barbershop to the mountains of Colorado to the pulpit. Mattie Grace stepped right out of a trash pile into an old man's heart. Vowing that the pain, suffering, and abuse she endured as a pup would never happen to her again, the man took her in as an orphan and adopted her as if she were his child. She was just a tiny package crammed to overflowing with energy, enthusiasm, excitement, curiosity, charm, and charisma. Mattie became the spark plug of the family and scattered love around everywhere, the way the wind scatters leaves. A Matter of Grace will warm your heart and convince you that life gives second chances. Marion Collier has spoken to thousands of people as a preacher, teacher, entertainer, and motivator.

They are the underlying cause of many concerning behaviors such as excessive barking, aggression, destructive behaviors, and house-soiling. They are also the source for deterioration of the human-animal bond, and can make a trip to the veterinarian, pet groomer, or boarding facility miserable for pet and owner alike. Left untreated, these negative experiences can lead to devastating consequences and permanent damage. Unfortunately, many well-meaning owners misinterpret or overlook the often subtle signs of emotional injury and turmoil, or think that the pet will simply \"outgrow\" it. This leads to unnecessary trauma and suffering. Common FAS triggers include: Trips to the veterinarian (even for routine services such as vaccinations and nail trims) Bath time, brushing, or cleaning ears. Loud noises; thunderstorms; fireworks; the vacuum cleaner; construction; gunshots; or even buzzers on appliances. Less-familiar people or animals encountered on walks or near the home. Being left alone during work hours or even for short errands. Travel, including car rides. Finally, there's help. From Fearful to Fear Free is based on the groundbreaking Fear Free program embraced by tens of thousands of veterinary healthcare professionals and hundreds of thousands of pet owners (fearfreepets.com and fearfreehappyhomes.com). This is the first and most authoritative book on the subject of reducing FAS and increasing \"happy and calm\" in dogs. Since pets communicate nonverbally, this book will help you recognize if your pet is suffering from FAS. By knowing your dog's body language, vocalizations, and changes in normal habits, you can make an accurate diagnosis and take action to prevent triggers or treat the fallout if they do happen. You'll learn: The most effective prescription sedatives for keeping dogs calm and happy during thunderstorms, fireworks, and other stressful events. The positive steps you can take to keep your pet occupied, calm, and content while you're away at work or play. Simple, practical tactics for helping your dog learn to love going to the veterinarian's office\u2014literally pulling you into the practice instead of avoiding it! How to easily groom your dog and give him medication. Tips to tame the chaos when guests arrive in your home or when your dog encounters other dogs and people on walks. Ways to tackle some of the common behavior issues that often have a root cause of FAS, while also improving your communication and bond with your pet. The three veterinary coauthors and one highly respected pet trainer have a combined 88 years of experience in the trenches of veterinary medicine, with specialties in behavior and training.

It gives the stockmen and farmers directly concerned with the cattle a better understanding of animal behaviour and the ways cattle communicate their comfort or distress. The book discusses normal cattle behaviour and shows how domestication and breeding can affect behaviour to achieve high levels of production of milk, live weight gain and fertility. Animal welfare is important for producers because it can affect the health, production and contentment of cows. Animal welfare practices which adversely affect cow and herd performance on tropical small holder dairy farms are identified. Advice is then given to change the animal's environment or modify a handler's technique to ensure cattle have the degree of comfort needed to achieve more profitable and sustainable systems of livestock farming. Cow Talk will be a beneficial resource for farmers who want to improve animal welfare, farm advisers who can assist farmers to improve their welfare practices, educators who develop training programs for farmers and dairy advisers, and other stakeholders in tropical dairy production such as local agribusiness, policy makers and research scientists.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781486301621"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1486301622"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xPt1BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xPt1BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xPt1BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xPt1BgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Cow_Talk.html?hl=&id=xPt1BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xPt1BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2eTovVpq_x0C", "etag": "feB4SFJimNk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2eTovVpq_x0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Your German Shepherd Puppy Month By Month", "authors": ["Debra Eldredge", "Liz Palika"], "publisher": "Penguin", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04", "description": "Your German Shepherd Puppy Month-by-Month provides readers with everything they need to know and do at each stage of development to make sure their playful, energetic puppy grows into a happy, healthy, and well-adjusted companion.

Billi, an Asian leopard cat, lives in a mango forest in ancient India. He enjoys his independence, but he feels pangs of loneliness and curiosity about the \"two-foots.\" He learns their languages - Hindi, Malayam and Sanskrit - and he can \"see the appeal of south India's three major religions.\" Billi embarks on a quest to learn more about humans by discovering what their animals think of them. A water buffalo mourns being underappreciated; a parrot bemoans his cage; a mongoose tells a chilling story about human ingratitude. Billi reminds a cow that it's worshipped by humans. \"Oh, great,\" the cow says. \"That and five rupees will get you a chapati.\" Nine months of travel and no truly good word for humans leaves Billi undeterred and, back home, he seeks out a young girl he'd often watched. It's not easy proving his good intentions or trying to be \"the only animal to have a mutually satisfying relationship with humans,\" but Billi makes it happen in a story that's heartwarming not only for the passionate cat fan but for all readers.

This approach uses the relationship between humans and their (mainly) mammalian pets to support the growth of emotion regulation, social skills, and mental health in children, adolescents, and adults. But how are humans and animals able to develop close bonds at all? What makes it possible for animals to have a therapeutic effect on humans? And how can we best use this understanding in animal-assisted therapy? In this unique book, a team of expert biologists and psychologists integrate and combine sophisticated biological and psychological knowledge to answer these questions.

In many people's perception, fish, with their lack of facial expressions or recognisable communication, are not seen to count when it comes to welfare. Angling is a major sport, and fishing a big industry. Millions of fish are caught on barbed hooks, or left to die by suffocation on the decks of fishing boats. Here, biologist Victoria Braithwaite explores the question of fish pain and fish suffering, explaining what we now understand about fish behaviour, and examining the related ethical questions about how we should treat these animals. She asks why the question of pain in fish has not been raised earlier, indicating our prejudices and assumptions; and argues that the latest and growing scientific evidence would suggest that we should widen to fish the protection currently given to birds and mammals.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780191613968"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0191613967"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aMvonPqzu_cC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 420.04, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 294.03, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&rdid=book-aMvonPqzu_cC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 420040000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 294030000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Do_Fish_Feel_Pain-sample-epub.acsm?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Do_Fish_Feel_Pain-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aMvonPqzu_cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9e_8AAAAQBAJ", "etag": "yXM+gLo3SM0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9e_8AAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How Dogs Love Us", "subtitle": "A Neuroscientist and His Adopted Dog Decode the Canine Brain", "authors": ["Gregory Berns"], "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "publishedDate": "2013", "description": "A neuroscientist recounts his efforts to overcome administrative and behavioral hurdles to train his dogs to sit still during an MRI scan, an effort that produced evidence about canine empathy and the human-dog bond.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780544114517"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0544114515"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 248, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Pets"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9e_8AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9e_8AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9e_8AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=103&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9e_8AAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_Dogs_Love_Us.html?hl=&id=9e_8AAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9e_8AAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Dee4B2ZLLC4C", "etag": "GbxBe24kil4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Dee4B2ZLLC4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Stop That Dog Now!

It spent more than seven months on the New York Timesbestseller list, nearly the entire time in the top five. It has sold nearly a million copies, spawned three children's books, and will be the basis for a movie starring Meryl Streep that is in the works. No doubt about it, this is one beloved cat. But he's more than just a bestselling franchise: Dewey has created a community. Dewey touched readers everywhere, who realized that no matter how difficult their lives might seem, or how ordinary their talents, they can - and should - make a positive difference to those around them. Dewey's Nine Livescontinues the formula that made Dewey so successful: inspiring, funny, and heart-warming stories about cats told from the perspective of 'Dewey's Mum,' librarian Vicki Myron. The amazing felines in this book include Dewey, of course, whose further never-before-told adventures and amazing legacy are chronicled, but several others who Vicki found out about when their owners reached out to her. Vicki learned, through extensive interviews and story sharing, what made these cats special, and how they fit into Dewey's community of perseverance and love. From a divorced mother in Alaska who saved a drowning kitten on Christmas Eve to a post-traumatic stress-disorder - suffering veteran whose heart was opened by his long relationship with a rescued cat, these Dewey-style stories will inspire readers to laugh, cry, care, and, most importantly, believe in the magic of animals to touch individual lives.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781847378583"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1847378587"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Pets"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 27, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 351.64, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 246.15, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC&rdid=book-vOG4LEUTJrwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 351640000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 246150000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dewey_s_Nine_Lives-sample-epub.acsm?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vOG4LEUTJrwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AC95cdzhg_4C", "etag": "FEBSO+0Dq4I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AC95cdzhg_4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "First Friend", "subtitle": "A History of Dogs and Humans", "authors": ["Katharine Rogers"], "publisher": "iUniverse", "publishedDate": "2010-04", "description": "Dogs have shared our homes for as long as we can remember, and, in return, have guarded us, helped us hunt, and herded our livestock.

Some of you may be thinking: \"a book about a dog, how totally brilliant, I need hear no more, I'm sold.\" In which case we should be best friends and go out to tea together, every day. Others of you may be thinking: \"a book about a dog, how totally mad, she must have officially lost it.\" In which case I completely understand. For I once viewed dog owners with much suspicion. The way they obsessively talk about their dogs often using voices for them to reply; the way they have a light covering of dog hair all over their clothes and sofas; and worse, an alarming comfort and ease around excrement. But I now get why people become so mad about their hounds. It wasn't instant love I have to admit. Getting a puppy when I was at a low ebb in my life wasn't easy - there was a lot of challenging, what I call, dog administration (dog-min), and the humiliating first trip to the vet still haunts me. It's been a bumpy old road, but Peggy has been lovingly by my side through some life-changing moments and I wouldn't have coped without her. Most surprisingly she has taught me a huge amount - not how to get an old pie packet out of a bin and lick it (I could already do that), but real lessons about life and love and trust and friendship.

Perhaps more than any other breed, the pit bull has been dogged by negative stereotypes. In truth, pit bulls are innately wonderful family pets, as capable of love and good deeds as any other type of dog. Setting the record straight, Ken Foster sings the praises of pit bulls in I\u2019m a Good Dog, a gorgeously illustrated, tenderly written tribute to this most misunderstood of canines. Founder of the Sula Foundation, which promotes responsible pit bull ownership in New Orleans, and the author of two acclaimed books about abandoned dogs, Foster has made it his mission to bring overlooked canines into the limelight. I\u2019m a Good Dog traces the fascinating history of this particularly maligned breed. A century ago, the pit bull was considered a family dog, featured in family photos and trusted as loving companions for children. More recently, pit bulls have been portrayed by the media as stereotypes of everything they are not. Foster shatters that reputation through moving profiles of pit bulls that serve as therapy dogs, athletic heroes, search-and-rescue dogs, and educators, not to mention as loving pets. Foster also profiles many pit bull lovers, from Helen Keller and Dr. Seuss to actor Todd Cerveris, who took his pit bull on tour with him for the musical Spring Awakening. Proving that there\u2019s much to love and nothing to fear, I\u2019m a Good Dog restores the pit bull to its rightful place as friend, family member, athlete and entertainer.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780399576638"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0399576630"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Pets"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 653.81, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 326.9, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-fZW1CgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 653810000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 326900000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/I_m_a_Good_Dog-sample-epub.acsm?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fZW1CgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nR2zDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "XumNA0oMNQY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nR2zDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Dog Called Harry", "authors": ["Jill Baker"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2020-02-25", "description": "How much do you think you could take?

Martie's husband, Dusty, loves her profoundly, and is desperate to understand the cause of her autophobia.
