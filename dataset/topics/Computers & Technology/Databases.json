Manufacturing Databases and Computer Integrated Systems presents the compelling argument for using computers as database integrators, a concept beyond the obvious applications of number crunching and data storage. The book addresses several different areas of manufacturing technology, including product policies in manufacturing, fuzzy controls in plant operations, concurrent engineering, practical applications for expert systems, organizational prerequisites in manufacturing, heterogenous database environments, the benefits of object-oriented databases, and the requirements for virtual database integration. Manufacturing Databases and Computer Integrated Systems also presents case studies, including the TRW solution applied in Operation Desert Storm, Project CRONUS by BBN, the Intelligent Database Assistant (IDA) by GTE, General Motor's DATAPLEX solution, and Project Carnot by the Microelectronics and Computer Development Corporation (MCC).

The realization of this promise lies fundamentally in the availability of enhanced services such as structured ways for classifying and registering shared infor- tion, veri?cation and certi?cation of information, content distributed schemes and quality of content, security features, information discovery and accessib- ity, interoperation and composition of active information services, and ?nally market-based mechanisms to allow cooperative and noncooperative information exchanges. The P2P paradigm lends itself to constructing large-scale, complex, adaptive, autonomous and heterogeneous database and information systems, endowed with clearly speci?ed and di?erential capabilities to negotiate, bargain, coordinate and self-organize the information exchanges in large-scale networks. This vision will have a radical impact on the structure of complex organizations (business, sci- ti?c or otherwise) and on the emergence and the formation of social communities, and on how the information is organized and processed. The P2P information paradigm naturally encompasses static and wireless connectivity and static and mobile architectures. Wireless connectivity combined with the increasingly small and powerful mobile devices and sensors poses new challenges as well as opp- tunities to the database community. Information becomes ubiquitous, highly distributed and accessible anywhere and at any time over highly dynamic, - stable networks with very severe constraints on the information management and processing capabilities.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540716600"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540716602"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 418, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=87HKRzeRKcgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=87HKRzeRKcgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=87HKRzeRKcgC&pg=PA203&dq=Databases+computers&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=87HKRzeRKcgC&dq=Databases+computers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Databases_Information_Systems_and_Peer_t.html?hl=&id=87HKRzeRKcgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Databases_Information_Systems_and_Peer_t-sample-pdf.acsm?id=87HKRzeRKcgC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=87HKRzeRKcgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "1 Introduction For the portable types of mobile hardware, from notebook <br>\n<b>computers</b> and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to smart and mobile phones, <br>\nfunctionality re- lated to information systems\u2014like accessing a <b>database</b> from or <br>\nrunning&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Aeu-DwAAQBAJ", "etag": "aQrFTfX1fyw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Aeu-DwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Advanced Computing Applications, Databases and Networks", "authors": ["S.A Begum"], "publisher": "ALPHA SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED", "publishedDate": "2011-05-13", "description": "ADVANCED COMPUTING APPLICATIONS, DATABASES AND NETWORKS focuses on new developments and advances in three major areas of Computer Science.

However, relational database systems were not designed for modern applications and computers. As a result, specialized database systems now proliferate trying to capture various pieces of the database market. Database research is pulled into di?erent directions, and speci- ized database conferences are created. Yet the current chaos in databases is likely only temporary because every technology, including databases, becomes standardized over time. The history of databases shows periods of chaos followed by periods of dominant technologies. For example, in the early days of computing, users stored their data in text ?les in any format and organization they wanted. These early days were followed by information retrieval systems, which required some structure for text documents, such as a title, authors, and a publisher. The information retrieval systems were followed by database systems, which added even more structure to the data and made querying easier. In the late 1990s, the emergence of the Internet brought a period of relative chaos and interest in unstructured and \u201csemistructured data\u201d as it wasenvisionedthateverywebpagewouldbelikeapageinabook.However, with the growing maturity of the Internet, the interest in structured data was regained because the most popular websites are, in fact, based on databases. The question is not whether future data stores need structure but what structure they need.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781849960946"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1849960941"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 744, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gnVdtvb9wH0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gnVdtvb9wH0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gnVdtvb9wH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Databases+computers&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gnVdtvb9wH0C&dq=Databases+computers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Databases.html?hl=&id=gnVdtvb9wH0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Introduction_to_Databases-sample-pdf.acsm?id=gnVdtvb9wH0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gnVdtvb9wH0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The theory covered is complemented by a detailed examination of specific applications from a broad range of diverse areas.

A number of standards and techniques have been developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), e.g., the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which provides a general method for conceptual descriptions for Web resources, and SPARQL, an RDF querying language. Recent examples of large RDF data with billions of facts include the UniProt comprehensive catalog of protein sequence, function and annotation data, the RDF data extracted from Wikipedia, and Princeton University\u2019s WordNet. Clearly, querying performance has become a key issue for Semantic Web applications. In his book, Groppe details various aspects of high-performance Semantic Web data management and query processing. His presentation fills the gap between Semantic Web and database books, which either fail to take into account the performance issues of large-scale data management or fail to exploit the special properties of Semantic Web data models and queries. After a general introduction to the relevant Semantic Web standards, he presents specialized indexing and sorting algorithms, adapted approaches for logical and physical query optimization, optimization possibilities when using the parallel database technologies of today\u2019s multicore processors, and visual and embedded query languages. Groppe primarily targets researchers, students, and developers of large-scale Semantic Web applications.

Free from the memory limitations and underpowered processors of other handheld platforms, Pocket Access and eMbedded Visual Basic are providing the Pocket PC with the same one-two punch that Microsoft Access and Visual Basic gave Windows application development in the early 1990s. As the first rapid application development tool for the Pocket PC, eMbedded Visual Basic increases developer productivity and allows for the creation of a wide range of database applications to empower an increasingly mobile workforce. This is the first book on the market to focus on Pocket PC development using Microsoft's free eMbedded Visual Basic 3.0. Pocket PC Database Development with eMbedded Visual Basic is designed to get software developers up to speed building Pocket Access database applications using eMbedded Visual Basic on the Pocket PC. Author Rob Tiffany has put his own Visual Basic background to work in developing advanced Pocket PC applications for large energy companies. It's from this perspective that he guides professional Visual Basic and Access programmers into the world of Pocket PC software development. This book ramps up your skills in fast-paced but pragmatic fashion. After describing the subset of the SQL language that Pocket PC developers need to know, the author guides you through Microsoft's ADOCE and ActiveSync technologies with no-nonsense examples. Tiffany effectively shares his \"been there, done that\" experience to help programmers avoid the shoals can sink efforts to build Pocket PC applications that communicate with either local Pocket Access databases or remote SQL Server databases.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781430211426"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1430211423"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 265, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yb4YAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yb4YAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Yb4YAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Databases+computers&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Yb4YAAAAQBAJ&dq=Databases+computers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Pocket_PC_Database_Development_with_eMbe.html?hl=&id=Yb4YAAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Pocket_PC_Database_Development_with_eMbe-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Yb4YAAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Yb4YAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "CHAPTER 1 Getting Started IT&#39;s VERY LIKELY THAT you picked up this book <br>\nbecause you&#39;ve never seen SQL, <b>database</b> development, the Pocket <b>PC</b>, and <br>\neMbedded Visual Basic 3.0 all put together in a book title before.

As journalists quickly move toward the 21st century and perhaps, a new era of electronic journalism, resources are needed to understand the newest and most successful computer-based news reporting strategies. Written to serve that purpose, this book is designed to show both professional journalists and students which of the newest personal computing tools are being used by the nation's leading news organizations and top individual journalists. It further describes how these resources are being used on a daily basis and for special projects. In recent years, computers have taken on new and dominating roles in the process of news analysis, newsgathering, and news processing. Today's forward-thinking journalists often seek guidance over what they can do to strengthen their ability to be society's information processors and managers. This volume focuses upon how successful journalists are using computers through a major national computer-assisted reporting (CAR) study of daily newspapers. The study included two national surveys and a series of personal interviews with many of the nation's leading CAR specialists. Several current examples of stories used for successful database- and online-oriented news assignments are provided as part of a series of case studies incorporated throughout the book. The additional depth of description and the presentation of portions of stories themselves should help readers to understand the complete process involving CAR-oriented journalism. Substantial analytical detail is used to discuss the extent of computer use in newsrooms, computer training, CAR projects, CAR in daily reporting, hardware and software most commonly used, levels and types of online services used in news research, and portable hardware and software. The book concludes with the author's assessment of the effects and impact of personal computing in the newsroom and the future of personal computer applications in newsgathering.

The material concentrates on fundamental theories as well as techniques and algorithms. The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and, more recently, the emergence of cloud computing and streaming data applications, has forced a renewal of interest in distributed and parallel data management, while, at the same time, requiring a rethinking of some of the traditional techniques. This book covers the breadth and depth of this re-emerging field. The coverage consists of two parts. The first part discusses the fundamental principles of distributed data management and includes distribution design, data integration, distributed query processing and optimization, distributed transaction management, and replication. The second part focuses on more advanced topics and includes discussion of parallel database systems, distributed object management, peer-to-peer data management, web data management, data stream systems, and cloud computing. New in this Edition: \u2022 New chapters, covering database replication, database integration, multidatabase query processing, peer-to-peer data management, and web data management. \u2022 Coverage of emerging topics such as data streams and cloud computing \u2022 Extensive revisions and updates based on years of class testing and feedback Ancillary teaching materials are available.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1441988343"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781441988348"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 846, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&pg=PA497&dq=Databases+computers&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&rdid=book-TOBaLQMuNV4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Principles_of_Distributed_Database_Syste-sample-epub.acsm?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Principles_of_Distributed_Database_Syste-sample-pdf.acsm?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TOBaLQMuNV4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Supporting very large <b>databases</b> efficiently for either OLTP or OLAP can be <br>\naddressed by combining parallel <b>computing</b> and distributed <b>database</b> <br>\nmanagement.
