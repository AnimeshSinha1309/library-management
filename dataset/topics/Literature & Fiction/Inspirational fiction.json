Gage agrees to teach Willow how to shoot, ride and lasso--but only to keep her close. An outlaw who's cost him dearly is still on the loose. And the hidden lawman trusts no one, especially not a feisty woman who might be working with his foe.

Powers"], "publisher": "WestBow Press", "publishedDate": "2014-11-24", "description": "Passing the Baton of Light is the unique and unusual story of one woman who went from wearing the robes of a stripper to those of a respected member of the clergy. This is a book about God's light and the lure of Hollywood's spotlight. Beverly Powers' past reads like fiction, but her credentials speak for themselves. From three Elvis Presley movies, to dozens of Red Skelton Shows, to portraying herself in Breakfast at Tiffany's with Audrey Hepburn, Beverly's life is a world of dichotomies. Passing the Baton of Light is a story of a family tree filled with rotten fruit, thorns and weeds: the abuse; betrayals; choices... and the consequences. This book is filled with tell-all accounts of how one woman fought to bring light to herself and the darkened world she was born into. This is a true story of miracles; of love between two teenagers who grow old together; a mother who struggles to save her prodigal son; and a praying grandmother who refused to let Satan have his way with her family; and the Heavenly Father who loved them all. Explore and learn with Beverly as she stumbles into her future not knowing where she is headed. Beverly's life brings dignity to the meaning of God's grace.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781490854885"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1490854886"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 282, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1N2kBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1N2kBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1N2kBQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Inspirational+fiction&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1N2kBQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Inspirational+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Passing_the_Baton_of_Light.html?hl=&id=1N2kBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1N2kBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_cWv1ktsRJoC", "etag": "IM+Oxz3IkO0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_cWv1ktsRJoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cecelia", "authors": ["Patricia Strefling"], "publisher": "Xulon Press", "publishedDate": "2009-11", "description": "Chicago entrepreneur Cecelia Grace Giatano is rich, beautiful, and successful.
