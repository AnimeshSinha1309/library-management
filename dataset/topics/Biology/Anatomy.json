By exploring the practice of seventeenth-century anatomy, Anita Guerrini reveals how animals were central to collecting, describing, and classifyingnatural historyand how anatomy and natural history were linked through animal dissection and vivisection. She looks at the early modern animal project, and particularly at Joseph-Guichard Duverney and Claude Perrault, in the context of the court, the city of Paris, and burgeoning audiences for natural history. The Academy and the King s Garden were the two main sites in Paris for the performance of natural history, and much of the Scientific Revolution in France played itself out in these two public institutions. Fascinating stories are culled in \"The Courtiers Anatomists\" to explore the relationships between empiricism and theory, human and animal, the origins of the natural history museum and modern science, and the relationship between science and other cultural activities including art, music, and literature. This book will be warmly welcomed by historians of science, medicine, and France, as well as by early modernists and many others in the growing field of animal studies.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226247663"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "022624766X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 344, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Courtiers_Anatomists.html?hl=&id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TWVhGRckgHsC", "etag": "u7xfUXC0leI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TWVhGRckgHsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "General Anatomy and Musculoskeletal System", "authors": ["Michael Schuenke", "Lawrence M.

Anatomy began as a descriptive science in the days when Latin was the universal scientific language. Early anatomists described the structures they saw in that language, comparing them to common and familiar objects, or borrowing terms from the Greek and Arabic masters before them. In anatomic terminology, common Latin or Greek words are used as such for any part of the body for which the ancients had a name. For many other structures, scientific names have been invented either by using certain classical words which appear to be descriptive of the part concerned, or commonly, by combining Greek or Latin roots to form a new compound term. Memorization of such terms without understanding their meaning can lead to mental indigestion.As an aid to comprehension, this book also presents the roots from which many of these descriptive terms and compounds are derived. For practical convenience, the book is organized into abbreviations, prefixes and suffixes, general terms common to all body regions, short lists for each major body part, and an alphabetical list covering the entire body.

The authors translated those Latin chapters of the Fabrica dedicated to the brain, a milestone in the history of neuroscience. Many chapters are accompanied by a commentary tracking the discoveries that paved the way to our modern understanding of the brain - from the pineal gland that regulates sleep, the fornix and mammillary bodies for memory, the colliculi for auditory and visual perception, and the cerebellum for motor control, to the corpus callosum for interhemispheric cross-talk, the neural correlates of senses, and the methods for dissections. The chapters constitute a primer for those interested in the brain and history of neuroscience. The translation, written with modern anatomical terminology in mind, provides direct access to Vesalius' original work on the brain. Those interested in reading the words of the Renaissance master will find the book an invaluable addition to their Vesalian collection.

This engaging style allows students to bridge the all-important gap between the classroom where anatomy is taught and the clinic where anatomy is used. Michael F. Nolan has assembled learning activities as well as self-assessment tasks as the primary method of teaching for the student. The activities will acquaint students with clinically relevant aspects of human structure in ways similar to those that will be encountered in clinical practice. The self-assessment questions are a great tool that will provide an objective measure of progress and success in learning the material. The emphasis on human structure rather than on a particular skill or group of skills coupled with its unique format of being just text, allows Clinical Applications of Human Anatomy to be the perfect companion for traditional anatomy texts and courses.

Walt Whitman witnessed rapid changes in relations between the living and the dead. In the space of a few decades, dissection evolved from a posthumous punishment inflicted on criminals to an element of preservationist technology worthy of the presidential corpse of Abraham Lincoln. Whitman transitioned from a fervent opponent of medical bodysnatching to a literary celebrity who left behind instructions for his own autopsy, including the removal of his brain for scientific study. Grounded in archival discoveries, Afterlives traces the origins of nineteenth-century America\u2019s preservation compulsion, illuminating the influences of botanical, medical, spiritualist, and sentimental discourses on Whitman\u2019s work. Tuggle unveils previously unrecognized connections between Whitman and the leading \u201cmedical men\u201d of his era, such as the surgeon John H. Brinton, founding curator of the Army Medical Museum, and Silas Weir Mitchell, the neurologist who discovered phantom limb syndrome.

It investigates the \"mania\" for anatomical displays that swept the Italian peninsula, and traces the fashioning of anatomical models as important social, cultural, and political as well as medical tools. Over the course of the eighteenth century, anatomical specimens offered particularly accurate insights into the inner body. Being colored, soft, malleable, and often life-size, they promised to foster anatomical knowledge for different audiences in a delightful way. But how did anatomical models and preparations inscribe and mediate bodily knowledge? How did they change the way in which anatomical knowledge was created and communicated? And how did they affect the lives of those involved in their production, display, viewing, and handling? Examining the circumstances surrounding the creation and early viewing of anatomical displays in Bologna and Naples, Malleable Anatomies addresses these questions by reconstructing how anatomical modeling developed at the intersection of medical discourse, religious ritual, antiquarian and artistic cultures, and Grand Tour display. While doing so, it investigates the development of anatomical modeling in the context of the diverse worlds of visual and material practices that characterized the representation and display of the body in mid-eighteenth-century Italy. Drawing attention to the artisanal dimension of anatomical practice, and to the role of women as both makers and users of anatomical models, it considers how anatomical specimens lay at the center of a composite world of social interactions, which led to the fashioning of modelers as anatomical celebrities. Moreover, it examines how anatomical displays transformed the proverbially gruesome practice of anatomy into an enthralling experience that engaged audiences' senses.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780198736189"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0198736185"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Malleable_Anatomies.html?hl=&id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LZZ5AAAAQBAJ", "etag": "R9Sv18Lq2Z8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LZZ5AAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Gray's Atlas of Anatomy", "authors": ["Richard Lee Drake"], "publisher": "Elsevier Health Sciences", "publishedDate": "2008-01-01", "description": "Gray's Atlas of Anatomy, the companion resource to the popular Gray's Anatomy for Students, presents a vivid, visual depiction of anatomical structures. Newly updated with a wealth of material to facilitate study, this medical textbook demonstrates the correlation of structures with appropriate clinical images and surface anatomy - essential for proper identification in the dissection lab and successful preparation for course exams. Clinically focused, consistently and clearly illustrated throughout, and logically organized, Gray's Atlas of Anatomy makes it easier than ever to master the essential anatomy knowledge you need! Build on your existing anatomy knowledge with structures presented from a superficial to deep orientation, representing a logical progression through the body. Identify the various anatomical structures of the body and better understand their relationships to each other with the visual guidance of nearly 1,000 exquisitely illustrated anatomical figures. Visualize the clinical correlation between anatomical structures and surface landmarks with surface anatomy photographs overlaid with anatomical drawings. Recognize anatomical structures as they present in practice through more than 270 clinical images - including laparoscopic, radiologic, surgical, ophthalmoscopic, otoscopic, and other clinical views - placed adjacent to anatomic artwork for side-by-side comparison. Quickly access and review key information with more clinical correlations, in addition to new Summary Tables at the end of each chapter that cover relevant muscles, nerves, and arteries. Gain a full understanding of cranial nerves through a brand-new Cranial Nerve Review section that offers a visual guide of the nerves, a table of reflexes, and an additional table of nerve lesions.

Three post tests cover neurologic, body, and extremity content, offering additional opportunities for readers to test their comprehension. Chapter objectives focus your attention on the important concepts you are expected to master by the end of the chapter. A variety of engaging exercises, such as matching, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, fill-in-the-table, and labeling aid your learning and retention. Memory learning aids, such as mnemonics, help you memorize quickly so you can concentrate more on applications of concepts. Updated material corresponds with updates to the main text.

For each body system, the book logically first presents anatomic fundamentals necessary to understand the complex physiology of the body. Then physiologic processes are presented more visually than ever before. This new approach to clinical content maximizes the power of visual thinking by getting readers as close to the clinical content as they can get without actually being in the room with a patient. Complex ideas are broken down into their component parts, with each component made unmistakably simple in appealingly colorful and graphic ways.

His original ideas on the nervous system have been likened to those of William Harvey on the circulation of blood, and his privately published pamphlet detailing his ideas about the brain has been called the Magna Carta of neurology. He described the separate functions of different parts of the nervous system, new nerves and muscles, and several previously unrecognized neurological disorders, and he characterized the features of the facial palsy and its associated features now named after him. His sketches and paintings of the wounded from the Napoleonic Wars and his essays on the anatomical basis of expression changed the way art students are taught and influenced British and European artists, particularly the Pre-Raphaelites. He was a renowned medical teacher who founded his own private medical school, took over the famous Hunterian school, and helped establish the University of London and the Middlesex Hospital Medical School. So how is it that a man of such influence is virtually unknown today by most neuroscientists, biologists, and clinicians? Sir Charles Bell: His Life, Art, Neurological Concepts, and Controversial Legacy discusses the work and teachings of this brilliant man. His reputation was tarnished by charges of intellectual dishonesty and fraud, but his work changed the way scientists and clinicians think about the nervous system and its operation in health and disease, led directly to the work of Charles Darwin on facial expressions, and influenced the way artists view the human body and depict illnesses and wounds. Masterfully written by Dr. Michael J. Aminoff in his signature approachable style, this is the perfect addition to any library of medical history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190614966"}, {"type":

Petra K\u00f6pf-Maier, appears new in two volumes. This 5th edition of this classic of anatomy is the result of intensive collaboration between recognized scientists, dissectors and graphic artists. The high-class illustrative material, one of the main features of the standard atlas, has been printed in color throughout and extended by providing a large amount of anatomical sections, x-ray plates, computerized tomograms and magnetic resonance images as well as ultrasound pictures. This has been done taking the enormous clinical importance of modern imaging techniques into consideration. Placing the respective anatomical sections and radiologic images directly opposite each other should facilitate the interpretation of CT and MRI scans and open new approaches to a better understanding. A successful clinical approach without an established knowledge of macroscopic anatomy including sectional anatomy is no longer feasible today. Wolf-Heideggers Atlas of Human Anatomy is aimed at students of human medicine and dentistry in the preclinical and clinical stages of their studies as well as clinical practitioners. It conveys an as lifelike as possible aspect of the organ systems of the human body and presents sectional anatomy and radiological pictures in direct opposition to each other. Wolf-Heideggers Atlas der Anatomie des Menschen, von Univ.-Prof. Dr. med. Petra K\u00f6pf-Maier vollst\u00e4ndig \u00fcberarbeitet, erg\u00e4nzt und modernisiert, erscheint neu in zwei B\u00e4nden. Die vorliegende 5. Auflage des Anatomie-Klassikers ist durch eine intensive Zusammenarbeit anerkannter Wissenschaftler, Pr\u00e4paratoren und Graphiker entstanden. Das hochklassige Bildmaterial, ein Hauptmerkmal dieses bew\u00e4hrten Atlas, wurde durchg\u00e4ngig koloriert und durch zahlreiche anatomische Schnittbilder, R\u00f6ntgenbilder, Computer- und Kernspintomogramme sowie Ultraschallbilder erweitert. Dies geschah, um der enormen klinischen Bedeutung moderner bildgebender Verfahren Rechnung zu tragen. Die direkte Gegen\u00fcberstellung von sich entsprechenden anatomischen und radiologischen Schnittbildern soll die Interpretation von Computer- und Magnetresonanztomogrammen erleichtern und den Zugang zu ihrem Verst\u00e4ndnis er\u00f6ffnen.

Students and professionals alike will also be able to view fully interactive 3-D animations that detail muscle and joint function. A scaled down version of Interactive Functional Anatomy, this software features a complete high-resolution 3-D model of the human musculature. The model can be rotated and allows for 11 layers of anatomy to be visually removed (from skin to bone) with a strip-away technique. Specific muscles within the 3-D model can be highlighted for viewing accompanying text about the selected muscle, such as name, agonists, antagonists, proximal and distal attachments, nerve innervation, blood supply, and primary and secondary actions. Text also accompanies specific ligaments within the model, providing information on function, injury mechanism, and pathology of injury. IFA Essentialsalso includes the following: -34 animations\u2014each of which can be viewed from four different angles\u2014 show clinical muscle function and providing students with a strong sense of the movement and motions around joints. -Four animations of gross human motions demonstrate complete body movements, such as sit-ups and push-ups, coupled with live-action video clips showing the electrical stimuli of active muscles. -Views of any specific structure on the screen can be rotated up to 360 degrees and stopped at any point for viewing. -Related text on structures further defines the structure being viewed. The anatomy text of IFA Essentialsincludes bones, ligaments, muscles, tendons, retinacula, capsules, cartilage, discs, and membranes. The program includes detailed animations for the shoulder, elbow and forearm, wrist and hand, trunk, hip, knee, and ankle and foot. Muscles that shorten and lengthen around each joint are color-coded to show their functions. IFA Essentialsalso offers an interactive quiz. Students can select the level of difficulty and number of quiz questions. Then, using a multiple-choice format, they are asked to identify or locate various structures on the model.

He owed his renown to a preparation method that greatly aided early-modern scientists in their exploration of the human body and transformed dissection from a messy business into a widely admired art. Ruysch s anatomical collection was one of Amsterdam s tourist attractions, for his embalmed bodies were astonishingly lifelike in appearance. The visitors who gazed with amazement at his preparations included the Russian tsar Peter the Great, who was so moved by the sight of an embalmed boy that he kneeled down to kiss him. The tsar later bought Ruysch s entire collection and had all the specimens shipped to St Petersburg, where they still attract visitors from all over the world. As the son-in-law of the well-known architect Pieter Post and the father of the accomplished painter Rachel Ruysch, Frederik Ruysch crossed the boundaries between art and science with ease. During his lifetime, the artistic side of his work sometimes provoked criticism from those in academic circles, but it is precisely his reputation as a virtuoso anatomist whose mastery of the arts of dissection and preservation enabled him to make preparations that seemed to defy death itself which has continued for centuries to inspire others, from Balzac to Stephen Jay Gould.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9004187847"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789004187849"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 470, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LiSPSQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LiSPSQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LiSPSQAACAAJ&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LiSPSQAACAAJ&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Death_Defied.html?hl=&id=LiSPSQAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LiSPSQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Pq1qAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "eOgg3JMrzEs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Pq1qAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Essentials of Human Anatomy", "authors": ["Russell Thomas Woodburne", "William E.

The book is fully illustrated and includes superb color plates. Among the complete textbooks of human anatomy, it is perhaps the most concise. For this edition the authors have included a new discussion of medical imaging techniques and have added many new diagnostic images. All their examples of imaging techniques are state-of-the-art quality and are related to the normal anatomy.

Boileau Grant graduated from Edinburgh University in 1908. At the outbreak of war he volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in the Grenadier Guards and the Black Watch. After demobilization in 1919 he accepted the invitation from the University of Manitoba to the Chair of Anatomy, which he occupied until 1930 when he went to Toronto as Professor of Anatomy. By then he had written his first textbook and had the first edition of the Atlas of Anatomy in progress, both of which brought him international recognition. The museum of anatomical specimens which he and his students had created in Toronto remains to this day a superb resource for the teaching of anatomy. He ended his academic career as Visiting Professor, UCLA, where the students voted him the Most Valuable Teacher award.

Partly a product of the public sanitation and health reform movements that began in the eighteenth century, partly a form of popular spectacle, early public anatomical exhibitions drew on two apparently distinct cultural developments: firstly, the professionalisation of medicine from the mid 1700s and the increasingly central role of practical anatomy within it; secondly, the rise of a culture of public spectacles such as world fairs, public museums, circuses and side shows, and the use of new visual technologies these spaces pioneered. Such spectacles often drew on medical discourses as a way of lending legitimacy to their displays of human bodies, while their popularity also helped makethe then-contentious practice of anatomy publicly acceptable. This book examines the cultural work performed by such exhibitions and their role in (re)producing new ways of seeing and knowing the body over the modern era. While public anatomical exhibitions might seem to occupy a marginal position in the history of popular culture and that of medicine, their distinctive intermixing of the medical and the spectacular has made them an influential and intensely productive cultural space, an important site of emergence for new ideas about bodily health and care. This book traces the influential role of such exhibitions in popularising a distinctly modern idea of the body as something requiring constant work and careful self-cultivation - an idea which continues to play a central role in the contemporary fascination with practices and possibilities of self-improvement. Through a series of representative case studies - including eighteenth-century exhibitions of anatomical Venuses, nineteenth-century anatomical museums \"for men only\" that served as quack clinics for sexual disorders, traditional and contemporary freak shows, and the recent public display of real human remains in Body Worlds and other such exhibitions - Anatomy as Spectacle traces how these exhibitions taught their spectators to see their bodies as something requiring constant self-monitoring and management, constructing an embodied modern subject who is always responsible, productive, temperate, and focusedon self-improvement.

The Anatomy and Physiology Learning System, 4th Edition makes it easy to learn normal structure and function of the body, and summarizes the common disorders found in each body system. Written by well-known educator Edith Applegate, this book combines clear, crisp writing with hundreds of vibrant illustrations. This edition includes a stronger emphasis on medical vocabulary, so you understand key terms before you learn anatomy. A wide array of engaging features simplifies physiology concepts, and an Evolve website supports the book with a wealth of new learning opportunities. Even if you have little or no background in science, you will learn the A&P you need to enter your career! A clear and concise writing style makes the book easy to read and understand, even if you have a limited background in science. Quick Check questions let you check your comprehension at various points within a chapter. Chapter quizzes provide recall, thought, and application questions to check your understanding of A&P concepts. A companion CD-ROM includes 80 detailed anatomy illustrations that you can color online or print out to color and study offline, and 3-D animations specific to each chapter. An Evolve website includes online tutoring, a Body Spectrum coloring book, Anatomy & Physiology Pioneers boxes with brief biographies of trailblazers in science and medicine, 3-D animations, an audio glossary, Spanish pronunciations of key terms, and frequently asked questions. Outlines and objectives at the beginning of each chapter help you prioritize your study. Key terms are highlighted to help you analyze, pronounce, and spell important medical words. A glossary provides definitions and a pronunciation guide for key terms. Functional Relationships pages illustrate the connection between each individual system and the other body systems, showing how all systems work together. Representative Disorders describe the common health issues associated with each body system. Focus on Aging boxes describe the effects of aging on body systems. Quick Applications boxes connect the material to real-world scenarios. From the Pharmacy boxes describe common medications for each body system and include a brief description of the drug and its action, common uses, and abbreviations. 100 new high-quality illustrations help you visualize anatomical features and physiological processes. Chapter summaries and vocabulary quizzes have been added to the end of each chapter.
