Gabriel"], "publisher": "Potomac Books, Inc.", "publishedDate": "2011-02-28", "description": "The Romans' destruction of Carthage after the Third Punic War erased any Carthaginian historical record of Hannibal's life. What we know of him comes exclusively from Roman historians who had every interest in minimizing his success, exaggerating his failures, and disparaging his character. The charges leveled against Hannibal include greed, cruelty and atrocity, sexual indulgence, and even cannibalism. But even these sources were forced to grudgingly admit to Hannibal's military genius, if only to make their eventual victory over him appear greater. Yet there is no doubt that Hannibal was the greatest Carthaginian general of the Second Punic War. When he did not defeat them outright, he fought to a standstill the best generals Rome produced, and he sustained his army in the field for sixteen long years without mutiny or desertion. Hannibal was a first-rate tactician, only a somewhat lesser strategist, and the greatest enemy Rome ever faced. When he at last met defeat at the hands of the Roman general Scipio, it was against an experienced officer who had to strengthen and reconfigure the Roman legion and invent mobile tactics in order to succeed.

Unlike some other Confederate memoirists, General Edward Porter Alexander had no use for bitter \u201cLost Cause\u201d theories to explain the South\u2019s defeat. Alexander was willing to objectively evaluate and criticize prominent Confederate officers, including Robert E. Lee. The result is a clear-eyed assessment of the long, bloody conflict that forged a nation. \u201cThe memoir opens with Alexander, recently graduated from West Point, heading to Utah to tamp down the hostile actions of Mormons who had refused to receive a territorial governor appointed by President Buchanan. A few years later, Alexander finds himself on the opposite side of a much larger rebellion-this time aligned with Confederates bent on secession from the Union. In the years that follow, he is involved in most of the major battles of the East, including Manassas, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga. Alexander describes each battle and battlefield in sharp detail. \u201cFew wartime narratives offer the insight and objectivity of Alexander\u2019s Military Memoirs of a Confederate .

Field Marshal Albert Kesselring was one of Germany\u2019s most capable military strategists. Originally a Bavarian army officer, he transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1935 and became G\u00f6ring\u2019s deputy, commanding air fleets during the invasion of France and the Battle of Britain. In 1941, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief South, sharing the direction of the North African campaign with Rommel. As Commander-in-Chief in Italy in 1943\u201344, his brilliant defense of the peninsula became legendary. In 1945, after the Ardennes offensive failed, Kesselring replaced von Rundstedt as Commander-in-Chief West. In his memoirs, Kesselring describes his military training, his service in World War I, his work in the Reichswehr, his role in the founding of the Luftwaffe, and all aspects of his command in World War II. Conducing with Kesselring\u2019s account of his trial and imprisonment for war crimes, these memoirs give a full picture of the whole military experience of one of Germany\u2019s great commanders.

The only soldier besides George Washington to be promoted to the highest rank in the U.S. Army (General of the Armies), Pershing was a mentor to the generation of generals who led America's forces during the Second World War. Though Pershing published a two-volume memoir, My Experiences in the World War, and has been the subject of numerous biographies, few know that he spent many years drafting a memoir of his experiences prior to the First World War. In My Life Before the World War, 1860--1917, John T. Greenwood rescues this vital resource from obscurity, making Pershing's valuable insights into key events in history widely available for the first time. Pershing performed frontier duty against the Apaches and Sioux from 1886--1891, fought in Cuba in 1898, served three tours of duty in the Philippines, and was an observer with the Japanese Army in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War. He also commanded the Mexican Punitive Expedition to capture Pancho Villa in 1916--1917. My Life Before the World War provides a rich personal account of events, people, and places as told by an observer at the center of the action. Carefully edited and annotated, this memoir is a significant contribution to our understanding of a legendary American soldier and the historic events in which he participated.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813141985"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0813141982"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 744, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aNfrnkW2AF4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aNfrnkW2AF4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aNfrnkW2AF4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aNfrnkW2AF4C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aNfrnkW2AF4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5291.15, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5291.15, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aNfrnkW2AF4C&rdid=book-aNfrnkW2AF4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5291150000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5291150000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aNfrnkW2AF4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In My Life Before the World War, 1860--1917, John T.

He commenced his military career through humble beginnings in the Bikaner State Forces with only a smattering knowledge of English. At the outbreak of World War 2 he was commissioned as an officer and served in the Middle East with his Battalion and on staff. By the time the War was over he was the only officer to have done two staff courses, including the prestigious course at Quetta. On being absorbed into the Indian Army after Independence, he was transferred to 3rd Gorkha Rifles, where he commanded two battalions. He was given command of the Para Brigade on promotion and led it in the Goa Operations with aplomb. He was primarily responsible for liberating this Portuguese Colony. Sagat's drive and energy stood out. On promotion as Major General, he commanded 17 Mountain Division in Sikkim, where in 1967, in a bloody skirmish which lasted several days, he gave the Chinese a bloody nose, proving that the Indian Army was no pushover. That year he was transferred to Shillong and tasked to curb the Mizo Insurgency. In two years he succeeded in doing so effectively. In 1970, he was promoted to Lt Gen and given command of 4 Corps. It seemed his whole life was geared to leading a Corps into battle. In 1971, in a major logistic achievement he moved and staged his Corps at Agartala. When operations commenced to liberate Bangladesh, his Corps relentlessly attacked and defeated Pakistan forces, crossed river lines and terrain considered impassable. His innovative use of helicopters has never been repeated. His is the only example in the Indian Army of a successful corps level campaign, which can stand out historically. His knowledge of the operational art was perhaps without parallel. He retired in Dec 1974 and settled down in Jaipur, where till his death in 2001, he tried to ameliorate the lives of ex-servicemen and his people. His achievements were recognised by the Government of Bangladesh, when the President, publicly and formally honoured his son and daughter-in-law in Mar 2013.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789382573739"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9382573739"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 332, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 885, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 442.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hASqCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 885000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 442500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Talent_for_War-sample-epub.acsm?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Talent_for_War-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hASqCQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Lt Gen Sagat Singh is unarguably the only military genius post independence India has produced."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xFvbGYGdn_gC", "etag": "aiSRiFwgTJQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xFvbGYGdn_gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Rattler One-Seven", "subtitle": "A Vietnam Helicopter Pilot's War Story", "authors": ["Chuck Gross"], "publisher": "University of North Texas Press", "publishedDate": "2006-06-13", "description": "Rattler One-Seven puts you in the helicopter seat, to see the war in Vietnam through the eyes of an inexperienced pilot as he transforms himself into a seasoned combat veteran.

During the time of Terry L. Thorsen's service from 1966 to 1970, the RIO played an integral part in enemy aircraft interception and ordnance delivery. In Navy and Marine F-4 Phantom jets, the RIO was a second pair of eyes for the pilot, in charge of communications and navigation, and great to have during emergencies. Thorsen endured the tough Platoon Leaders Course at Quantico and barely earned a commission. He underwent aviation and intercept training while suffering airsickness issues--and still earned his wings. Thorsen joined the oldest and most decorated squadron in the Marine Corps, the VMFA-232 Red Devils in southern California, as it prepared for deployment to Vietnam. In combat, Thorsen felt angst when he saw the sky darken around him from anti-aircraft artillery explosions high above the Ho Chi Minh Trail. On his first close air support mission in support of ground troops (the majority of his Marine aviation missions), he witnessed tracers whiz by his canopy. On one harrowing sortie, he and his pilot purposely became the target to save an Army unit battling an enemy just a hundred feet away. On secret missions with secret weapons, they dove at anti-aircraft artillery muzzle flashes and flew as a low as fifty feet off the deck during close air support sorties, \"scraping\" the napalm off their plane. For one mission a friend survived a crash landing, but a training instructor vanished without a trace.

This is the first volume of three in the only complete and fully reliable version of the memoirs available in English. In this volume, Khrushchev recounts how he became politically active as a young worker in Ukraine, how he climbed the ladder of power under Stalin to occupy leading positions in Ukraine and then Moscow, and how as a military commissar he experienced the war against the Nazi invaders. He vividly portrays life in Stalin's inner circle and among the generals who commanded the Soviet armies. Khrushchev&\u2019s sincere reflections upon his own thoughts and feelings add to the value of this unique personal and historical document.

When eighteen-year-old German stonemason Jakob Walter was conscripted into the Grand Army of Napoleon, he had no idea of the trials that lay ahead. The long, grueling marches in Prussia and Poland sacrificed countless men to Bonaparte\u2019s grand designs. And the disastrous Russian campaign tested human endurance on an epic scale. Demoralized by defeat in a war few supported or understood, deprived of ammunition and leadership, driven past reason by starvation and bitter cold, men often turned on one another, killing fellow soldiers for bread or an able horse. Though there are numerous surviving accounts of the Napoleonic Wars written by officers, Walter\u2019s is the only known memoir by a draftee, and as such is a unique and fascinating document\u2014a compelling chronicle of a young soldier\u2019s loss of innocence as well as an eloquent and moving portrait of the profound effects of war on the men who fight it. Professor Marc Raeff has added an Introduction to the memoirs as well as six letters home from the Russian front, previously unpublished in English, from German conscripts who served concurrently with Walter. The volume is illustrated with engravings and maps, contemporary with the manuscript, from the Russian/Soviet and East European collections of the New York Public Library.

After a horrific leg injury left him an invalid, the educated, inquisitive, perceptive, and exceptionally witty 12-year-old began keeping a diary in 1860--just as secession and the Civil War began tearing the country and his world apart. He continued to write even as his health deteriorated until both the war and his life ended in 1865. His unique manuscript of the demise of the Old South\u2014lauded by the Library of Congress as one of its premier holdings\u2014is published here for the first time in The War Outside My Window: The Civil War Diary of LeRoy Wiley Gresham, 1860-1865. LeRoy read books, devoured newspapers and magazines, listened to gossip, and discussed and debated important social and military issues with his parents and others. He wrote daily for five years, putting pen to paper with a vim and tongue-in-cheek vigor that impresses even now, more than 150 years later. His practical, philosophical, and occasionally Twain-like hilarious observations cover politics and the secession movement, the long and increasingly destructive Civil War, family pets, a wide variety of hobbies and interests, and what life was like at the center of a socially prominent wealthy family in the important Confederate manufacturing center of Macon. The young scribe often voiced concern about the family\u2019s pair of plantations outside town, and recorded his interactions and relationships with \u201cservants\u201d Howard, Allen, Eveline, and others as he pondered the fate of human bondage and his family\u2019s declining fortunes. Unbeknownst to LeRoy, he was chronicling his own slow and painful descent toward death in tandem with the demise of the Southern Confederacy. He recorded\u2014often in horrific detail\u2014an increasingly painful and debilitating disease that robbed him of his childhood. The teenager\u2019s declining health is a consistent thread coursing through his fascinating journals. \u201cI feel more discouraged [and] less hopeful about getting well than I ever did before,\u201d he wrote on March 17, 1863. \u201cI am weaker and more helpless than I ever was.\u201d Morphine and a score of other \u201cremedies\u201d did little to ease his suffering. Abscesses developed; nagging coughs and pain consumed him. Alternating between bouts of euphoria and despondency, he often wrote, \u201cSaw off my leg.\u201d The War Outside My Window, edited and annotated by Janet Croon with helpful footnotes and a detailed family biographical chart, captures the spirit and the character of a young privileged white teenager witnessing the demise of his world even as his own body slowly failed him. Just as Anne Frank has come down to us as the adolescent voice of World War II, LeRoy Gresham will now be remembered as the young voice of the Civil War South.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781611213898"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1611213894"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 800.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 400.04, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-a5FiDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 800080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 400040000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_War_Outside_My_Window-sample-epub.acsm?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_War_Outside_My_Window-sample-pdf.acsm?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=a5FiDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "His unique manuscript of the demise of the Old South\u2014lauded by the Library of Congress as one of its premier holdings\u2014is published here for the first time in The War Outside My Window: The Civil War Diary of LeRoy Wiley Gresham, 1860 ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZbqwaF1jq7sC", "etag": "/rX8tqoNdqU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZbqwaF1jq7sC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Dollfuss/Schuschnigg Era in Austria", "subtitle": "A Reassessment", "authors": ["G\u00c3\u00bcnter J.

During this period, Austria was in a desperate struggle to maintain its national independence vis--vis Hitler's Germany, a struggle that ultimately failed. In the end, the Nazis invaded and annexed Austria (Anschluss\"). Volume 11 of the Contemporary Austrian Studies series stays away from these heated historiographical debates and looks at economic, domestic, and international politics sine ira et studio. Timothy Kirk opens with an assessment of \"Austrofascism\" in light of recent discourse on interwar European fascism. Three scholars from the Economics University of Vienna analyze the macroeconomic climate of the 1930s: Hansjrg Klausinger the \"Vienna School's\" theoretical contributions to end the \"Great Depression\"; Gerhard Senft the economic policies of the Stndestaat; and Peter Berger the financial aid from the League of Nations. Jens Wessels delves into the microeconomic arena and presents case studies of leading Austrian businesses and their performance during the depression. Jim Miller looks at Dollfuss, the agrarian reformer. Alexander Lassner and Erwin Schmidl deal with the context of the international arena and Austria's desperate search for protection against Nazi Anschluss-pressure and military preparedness against foreign aggression. In a comparativist essay Megan Greene compares the policies of Austria's Haider and Italy's Berlusconi and recent EU responses to threats from the Right. The \"FORUM\" looks at various recent historical commissions in Austria dealing with Holocaust-era assets and their efforts to provide restitution to victims of Nazism. Two review essays, by Evan Burr Bukey and Hermann Freudenberger, survey recent scholarly literature on Austria(ns) during World War II. This addition to the Contemporary Austrian Studies series will be welcomed by political scientists, historians and scholars with a strong interest in European affairs. Gnter Bischof is professor of history and executive director of Center Austria at the University of New Orleans. Anton Pelinka is professor of political science at the University of Innsbruck and a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan in 2001/02. Alexander Lassner completed his Ph.D. at Ohio State University with his dissertation, \"Peace at Hitler's Price,\" on Austria's international position before the \"Anschluss.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1412821894"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781412821896"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 321, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&pg=PA163&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3637.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3637.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&rdid=book-ZbqwaF1jq7sC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3637300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3637300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Dollfuss_Schuschnigg_Era_in_Austria-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Dollfuss_Schuschnigg_Era_in_Austria-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZbqwaF1jq7sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "...

Brigid Hains has reinvigorated the tradition of 'frontier studies'. -Dr Jane Carruthers, University of South Africa The frontier mythology of the early twentieth century laid the groundwork for the wilderness cult of contemporary Australian life. It became etched in the Australian imagination through the image of folk heroes such as Douglas Mawson and John Flynn, promising national renewal through virile heroism and an encounter with 'wild' nature. Most frontier histories in Australia have focused on race relations; this is among the first to focus on the frontier as an ecological phenomenon. It draws on rich primary sources, many of which have never been published, including Antarctic diaries, and the letters and journalism of John Flynn. In this superb account Brigid Hains offers: -a new interpretation of two Australian folk heroes and their iconic status in Australian culture -a fresh approach to frontier history that focuses on the landscape rather than on racial conflict, and -an explanation of the origins of wilderness conservation in Australia. Mawson's Antarctic exploration and Flynn's Australian Inland Mission both drew on imperial and trans-Pacific influences, such as imperial adventure literature, the cult of polar exploration, the rural life movement, population theory and eugenics. The Ice and the Inland compares these two Australian folk heroes and analyses the reasons for their popularity. It raises a number of topical issues, including the role of Australia in the international management of Antarctica; Flynn's treatment of Aboriginal people; the reasons for conservation of Australia's wild places, from the arid Centre to the frozen wastes of Antarctica; and relationships between the country and the bush, and between the metropolis and the frontier.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0522850367"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780522850369"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 219, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E5BZUxPhM34C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E5BZUxPhM34C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E5BZUxPhM34C&pg=PA59&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E5BZUxPhM34C&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ice_and_the_Inland.html?hl=&id=E5BZUxPhM34C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=E5BZUxPhM34C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Accounts of exploration , missionary activity and <b>military</b> campaigns , together <br>\nwith <b>biographies</b> , <b>memoirs</b> and popular and juvenile fiction , abound in <br>\ndescriptions of the imperial chase . 2 The original image of the scout or <br>\nfrontiersman tended&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Nhrmm9tMLiwC", "etag": "FYGrOluPK4o", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Nhrmm9tMLiwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Eastern Arkansas", "subtitle": "Comprising a Condensed History of the State, a Number of Biographies of Distinguished Citizens of the Same, a Brief Descriptive History of Each of the Counties Named Herein, and Numerous Biographical Sketches of the Prominent Citizens of Such Counties", "authors": ["Goodspeed Publishing Company", "Goodspeed Publishing Company Staff"], "publishedDate": "1890", "description": "This volume contains Biographical Sketches of 1,250 individuals and 6,000 other families listed in these sketches.

Reed's Civil War from Manassas to Appomattox", "authors": ["William R. Cobb"], "publishedDate": "2020-11-15", "description": "John C. Reed fought through the war in General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as an officer in the 8th Georgia Infantry. A graduate of Princeton University and a classically educated aristocrat, he wrote home often and kept careful contemporaneous notes of his experiences in camp and on the battlefield. In 1888, Reed used these documents to produce a detailed memoir of his wartime experiences, but it was never published and because of an archival filing error after his death, was effectively lost for a century. The Military Memoirs of a Confederate Line Officer: Captain John C. Reed's Civil War from Manassas to Appomattox, edited by William R. Cobb, is published here in full for the first time. Reed was the son of a famous minister, educator, planter, and slave owner, and the understudy of Georgia's preeminent pre-war lawyer. When his state left the Union, the 25-year-old joined a local volunteer unit as a 2nd lieutenant. The outfit mustered into Confederate service as Company I (The Stephens Light Guards) of the 8th Georgia Volunteer Infantry, rode the rails north to Virginia, and fought the entire war from First Manassas through Appomattox. As a line officer, Reed had a front row seat to the fighting. He was wounded at least twice (at Second Manassas and again at Gettysburg), promoted to captain during the Battle of the Wilderness on May 6, 1864, and led his company through the balance of the Overland Campaign and through the horrific siege of Petersburg all the way to the surrender on April 9, 1865. The Military Memoirs of a Confederate Line Officer is a perceptive and articulate account filled with riveting recollections of some of the Civil War's most intense fighting. Reed doesn't shy away from providing his opinion on a variety of officers, decisions, and experiences, including the execution of deserters, premonitions of battlefield death, and what it was like to watch his friends and fellow soldiers die in battle.

But ask them to choose the best experience of their life, and they\u0092ll usually say it was war, too. For someone who has not been to war, this is nearly impossible to understand. The spectrum of emotions experienced by a combat veteran is far wider than that experienced in civilian life and for that reason it can be hard for a veteran to re-assimilate to civilian life. Ask a combat veteran about this, it\u0092s a common feeling. What is it about war that soldiers miss? This is a question that every civilian should try to understand. Weaving together a wide range of stories from the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier off Syria to climbing a forbidden Himalayan pass into Tibet, this moving and insightful book explains one of the most everlasting human pursuits \u0096 war. But its focus isn\u0092t solely war; it is also about coming home and confronting another kind of struggle, which we all share\u0097the search for happiness. In this collection, Peterson writes of war from the perspective of both a combatant and a witness taking the reader from combat missions over Afghanistan as an Air Force special operations pilot to the frontlines against ISIS in Iraq, and the trench and tank battles of the war in Ukraine. Interweaving his frontline reports with a narrative about his own transformation from a combat pilot to a war journalist, Peterson explores a timeless paradox \u0096 why does coming home from war feel like such a disappointment?", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781612007748"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1612007740"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=44&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1197.77, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 598.88, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3XvKDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1197770000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 598880000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Why_Soldiers_Miss_War-sample-epub.acsm?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Why_Soldiers_Miss_War-sample-pdf.acsm?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3XvKDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Ask a combat veteran about this, it_s a common feeling.

In this biography A.M.J. Hyatt recalls the military career of a remarkable man. Currie's achievements were realized in spite of some formidable obstacles. He was not a professional soldier, having been a civilian before the war. He entered the war under the shadow of a scandal, which, had it been disclosed at the time, would certainly have brought public disgrace. He was not a charismatic man; he had none of the personal flair of so many successful military leaders. In many ways these apparently negative factors make his story all the more remarkable, the secret of his success the more intriguing. That secret, as Hyatt explains, was a fine sense of tactics: Currie, the 'amateur' soldier, had all the instincts of a dedicated professional, and he used them to minimize the destruction of the young Canadian troops under his command. When the war was over Currie returned to civilian life, and was knighted for his service.

This book analyzes a wide range of cultural entities \u2013 from computer games to daytime television, from blockbuster fictional narratives such as Da Vinci Code to DNA genealogical tools \u2013 to analyze how history works in contemporary popular culture. Jerome de Groot probes how museums have responded to the heritage debate and the way in which new technologies have brought about a shift in access to history, from online game playing to internet genealogy. He discusses the often conflicted relationship between \u2018public\u2019 and academic history, and raises important questions about the theory and practice of history as a discipline. Whilst mainly focussing on the UK, the book also compares the experiences of the USA, France and Germany.

His choice of the Warwickshires was due to his lack of money. He saw service in India before impressing with his courage, tactical skill and staff ability in the Great War. Despite his tactless uncompromising manner his career flourished between the wars but it was during the retreat to Dunkirk that his true brilliance as a commander revealed itself. The rest is history but in this autobiography we can hear Monty telling his side of the story of the great North African Campaign followed by the even more momentous battles against the enemy and, sadly, the Allies as he strove for victory in North West Europe. His interpretation of the great campaign is of huge importance and reveals the deep differences that existed between him and Eisenhower and other leading figures. His career ended in disappointment and frustration being temperamentally unsuited to Whitehall and the political machinations of NATO.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781781597118"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1781597111"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 574, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 503.86, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 251.93, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BbXNDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 503860000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 251930000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Memoirs_of_Field_Marshal_Montgomery-sample-epub.acsm?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Memoirs_of_Field_Marshal_Montgomery-sample-pdf.acsm?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BbXNDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The rest is history but in this autobiography we can hear Monty telling his side of the story of the great North African Campaign followed by the even more momentous battles against the enemy and, sadly, the Allies as he strove for victory ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "jihmBgAAQBAJ", "etag": "bjIGh7/cwRk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jihmBgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Youth, Heroism and War Propaganda", "subtitle": "Britain and the Young Maritime Hero, 1745-1820", "authors": ["D.

At that time, Britain was searching for a new national identity, and the young maritime hero and his exploits conjured images of vigour, energy, enthusiasm and courage. Adopted as centrepiece in a campaign of concerted war-propaganda leading up to the Battle of Trafalgar, the young hero came to represent much that was quintessentially British at this major turning-point in the Nation's history. By drawing on a wide range of sources, this study shows how the young hero gave maritime youth a symbolic power which it had never before had in Britain. It offers a valuable contribution to the field of British military and naval history, as well as the study of British identity, youth, heroism and propaganda.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472522474"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472522478"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2790, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2790, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jihmBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2790000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2790000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Youth_Heroism_and_War_Propaganda-sample-epub.acsm?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Youth_Heroism_and_War_Propaganda-sample-pdf.acsm?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jihmBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Biographies</b> of leading <b>military</b> characters were, however, few and often of <br>\ndubious veracity.47 Neither Colonel Clive nor ... was accorded <b>biographies</b>, their <br>\nexploits treated instead in general histories.48 Moreover, when the <b>Memoirs</b> of &#39;<br>\nJohn&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "wUm5AAAAIAAJ", "etag": "lp/Ir+sllfI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wUm5AAAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Memoirs of General Jean V.

Drawing heavily on his meticulously kept wartime journals, Balck discusses his childhood and his career through the First and Second World Wars. His memoir details the command decision-making process as well as operations on the ground during crucial battles, including the Battle of the Marne in World War I and his incredible victories against a larger and better-equipped Soviet army at the Chir River in World War II. Balck also offers observations on Germany's greatest generals, such as Erich Ludendorff and Heinz Guderian, and shares his thoughts on international relations, domestic politics, and Germany's place in history.

He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Franklin where he was shot while rallying his troops. A brave and professional soldier, Stanley was a complex individual exhibiting concern for his soldiers and showing ferocity in battle. As Rosecrans' Chief of Cavalry, he deserves much credit for making the Union cavalry an important and formidable power in the Western Theater. He also commanded the IV Army Corps at the end of the war, all the while, a convert to Roman Catholicism, greatly influenced by his religious beliefs.

Honest and irrepressibly frank, these are the dramatic memoirs of a Russian officer on the Eastern Front, where he played his part in a clash of titans and witnessed the shuddering collapse of the Third Reich. The cataclysmic battle of Kursk in 1943 put an end to Hitler\u2019s hopes of victory on the Eastern Front, and it was Evgeni Bessonov\u2019s first battle. From then on the Germans were forced into a long, bitter retreat that ended in the ruins of Berlin in 1945. An officer in an elite guards unit of the Red Army, Bessonov rode tanks from Kursk, through a western Russia and Poland devastated by the Germans, and right into the heart of Nazi Germany. Tank Rider is the riveting memoir of Evgeni Bessonov telling of his years of service at the vanguard of the Red Army and daily encounters with the German foe. He brings large-scale battles to life, recounts the sniping and skirmishing that tried and tested soldiers on both sides, and narrates the overwhelming tragedy and horror of apocalyptic warfare on the Eastern Front. So much of the Soviet experience of World War II remains untold, but this memoir provides an important glimpse into some of the most decisive moments of this overlooked history. Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs. Our list includes biographies on well-known historical figures like Benjamin Franklin, Nelson Mandela, and Alexander Graham Bell, as well as villains from history, such as Heinrich Himmler, John Wayne Gacy, and O.

The Role of the Royal Navy in South America, 1920-1970 shows how the Royal Navy reacted to changing circumstances during the post-war decades by adopting a more pro-active attitude towards the imperative of supporting naval exports.

This important new study demonstrates that the assimilation of Lowland and Highland Scots into the British Army was a salient feature of its history in the first half of the 18th century and was already well advanced by the outbreak of the Seven Years War. Scotland and the British Army, 1700-1750 analyses the wider policing functions of the British Army, the role of Scotland's militia and the development of Scotland's military roads and institutions to provide a fuller understanding of the purpose and complexity of Scotland's military organisation and presence in Scotland in the turbulent decades between the Glorious Revolution and the defeat of Bonnie Prince Charlie, which has been too often simplified as an army of occupation for the suppression of Jacobitism. Instead, Victoria Henshaw reveals the complexities and difficulties experienced by Scottish soldiers of all ranks in the British Army as nationality, loyalty and prejudice clouded Scottish desires to

In 102 Days of War, Yaniv Barzilai takes the reader from meetings in the White House to the most sensitive operations in Afghanistan to explain how America\u00c6s enemies survived 2001. Using a broad array of sources, including interviews with top-level U.S. officials at every level of the war effort, Barzilai concludes that the failure to kill bin Laden and destroy al Qaeda at the Battle of Tora Bora was not only the result of a failure in tactics but, more importantly, the product of failures in policy and leadership. 102 Days of War provides novel information and a new level of understanding about the opening campaign of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.

On his thirty-sixth mission, he was shot down along with the crew of their B-24, \u201cMiss Fortune,\u201d over enemy lines near Lake Balaton, Hungary. Taken prisoner (or \u201cKriegsgefangenen #6410,\u201d the code name the Germans gave him), he never knew if he would see his homeland again. WALK TO FREEDOM: Kriegsgefangenen #6410 - Prisoner of War is Lenburg\u2019s powerful, compelling account of his 327 days of imprisonment and long walk to freedom eleven months after his capture. Recalling the inhumane treatment and horrific conditions of his encampment, the missions and memories, and the reunions of the few who survived fifty years later, this revised and expanded, illustrated memoir demonstrates why Lenburg and his crew were \u201cthe greatest generation\u201d of their time.

Like George Washington and his own hero Julius Caesar, he was one of the greatest soldier-statesmen of all times. Andrew Roberts\u2019s Napoleon is the first one-volume biography to take advantage of the recent publication of Napoleon\u2019s thirty-three thousand letters, which radically transform our understanding of his character and motivation. At last we see him as he was: protean multitasker, decisive, surprisingly willing to forgive his enemies and his errant wife Josephine. Like Churchill, he understood the strategic importance of telling his own story, and his memoirs, dictated from exile on St. Helena, became the single bestselling book of the nineteenth century. An award-winning historian, Roberts traveled to fifty-three of Napoleon\u2019s sixty battle sites, discovered crucial new documents in archives, and even made the long trip by boat to St. Helena.

Howard's Memoirs of Sir Sidney Smith Who was the greatest British admiral of the Napoleonic Era? Horatio Nelson? Perhaps. But, great as Nelson was, a strong case could be made that Sir Sidney Smith was at least his equal. His exploits were every bit as daring as those of Nelson, and in some ways he accomplished even more. But Nelson got the \"good press\" and Smith did not, and does not even today. In 1793, during the retreat from Toulon, Smith destroyed more French ships than had been destroyed in any British fleet action prior to that. Yet, he was blamed by Nelson and Collingwood (neither of whom were there) for not destroying more. The first person to defeat Napoleon on land-head-to-head-was not Wellington; it was Smith at the Battle of Acre. Everyone knows about Nelson at Trafalgar; but few people realize that there would probably have been no Trafalgar if Smith had not stopped Napoleon in the east. In 1839, Edward Howard, a writing colleague of Frederick Marryat, wrote the first of two seminal biographies that have appeared of Sir Sidney Smith. It was the only one seen and approved by Smith prior to his death. This valuable source document is reprinted here in it's entirety.

As an edited collection, it brings together an extensive group of authors from a range of disciplinary perspectives whose chapters engage with the conceptual, practical and political questions raised when doing military research. The book considers a wide range of questions around research about, on and with military organisations, personnel and activities, from diverse starting-points across the social sciences, arts and humanities. Each chapter in this volume: Describes the nature of the military research topic under scrutiny and explains what research practices were undertaken and why. Discusses the author's research activities, addressing the nature of their engagement with their subjects and explaining how the method or approach under scrutiny was distinctive because of the military context or subject of the research. Reflects on the author\u2019s research experiences, and the specific, often unique, negotiations with the politics and practices of military institutions and military personnel before, during and after their research fieldwork. The book provides a focussed overview of methodological approaches to critical studies of military personnel and institutions, and processes and practices of militarisation and militarism. In particular, it engages with the growth in qualitative approaches to military research, particularly research carried out on military topics outside military research institutions. The handbook provides the reader with a comprehensive guide to how critical military research is being undertaken by social scientists and humanities scholars today, and sets out suggestions for future approaches to military research. This book will be of much interest to students of military studies, war and conflict studies, and research methods in general.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781317042587"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1317042581"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Military+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22420, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22420, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-vf8SDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22420000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22420000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Routledge_Companion_to_Military_Rese-sample-pdf.acsm?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vf8SDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This new handbook is about the practices of conducting research on military issues."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "GXAGqw8aInkC", "etag": "OYEJ0h3FU08", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GXAGqw8aInkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ideas and Weapons", "authors": ["I.

No one, honey. The truth is, it hasn\u2019t always been gorgeous for this beacon of positivity and joy. Before he stole our hearts as the grooming and self-care expert on Netflix\u2019s hit show Queer Eye, Jonathan was growing up in a small Midwestern town that didn\u2019t understand why he was so\u2026over the top. From choreographed carpet figure skating routines to the unavoidable fact that he was Just. So.

Over the Top uncovers the pain and passion it took to end up becoming the model of self-love and acceptance that Jonathan is today. In this revelatory, raw, and rambunctious memoir, Jonathan shares never-before-told secrets and reveals sides of himself that the public has never seen. JVN fans may think they know the man behind the stiletto heels, the crop tops, and the iconic sayings, but there\u2019s much more to him than meets the Queer Eye.

Showalter"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2013-08-27", "description": "One of America\u2019s most distinguished military historians offers the definitive account of the greatest tank battle of World War II\u2014an epic clash of machines and men that matched the indomitable will of the Soviet Red Army against the awesome might of the Nazi Wehrmacht. While the Battle of Kursk has long captivated World War II aficionados, it has been unjustly overlooked by historians. Drawing on the masses of new information made available by the opening of the Russian military archives, Dennis Showalter at last corrects that error. This battle was the critical turning point on World War II\u2019s Eastern Front. In the aftermath of the Red Army\u2019s brutal repulse of the Germans at Stalingrad, the stakes could not have been higher. More than three million men and eight thousand tanks met in the heart of the Soviet Union, some four hundred miles south of Moscow, in an encounter that both sides knew would reshape the war. The adversaries were at the peak of their respective powers. On both sides, the generals and the dictators they served were in agreement on where, why, and how to fight. The result was a furious death grapple between two of history\u2019s most formidable fighting forces\u2014a battle that might possibly have been the greatest of all time. In Armor and Blood, Showalter re-creates every aspect of this dramatic struggle. He offers expert perspective on strategy and tactics at the highest levels, from the halls of power in Moscow and Berlin to the battlefield command posts on both sides. But it is the author\u2019s exploration of the human dimension of armored combat that truly distinguishes this book. In the classic tradition of John Keegan\u2019s The Face of Battle, Showalter\u2019s narrative crackles with insight into the unique dynamics of tank warfare\u2014its effect on men\u2019s minds as well as their bodies. Scrupulously researched, exhaustively documented, and vividly illustrated, this book is a chilling testament to man\u2019s ability to build and to destroy. When the dust settled, the field at Kursk was nothing more than a wasteland of steel carcasses, dead soldiers, and smoking debris. The Soviet victory ended German hopes of restoring their position on the Eastern Front, and put the Red Army on the road to Berlin. Armor and Blood presents readers with what will likely be the authoritative study of Kursk for decades to come. Advance praise for Armor and Blood \u201cThe size and the brutality of the vast tank battle at Kursk appalls, this struggle that gives an especially dark meaning to that shopworn phrase \u2018last full measure.\u2019 Prepare yourself for a wild and feverish ride over the steppes of Russia. You can have no better guide than Dennis E. Showalter, who speaks with an authority equaled by few military historians.\u201d\u2014Robert Cowley, founding editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History \u201cA fresh, skillful, and complete synthesis of recent revelations about this famous battle . . . As a myth buster, Armor and Blood is a must-read for those interested in general and military history.\u201d\u2014David M. Glantz, editor of The Journal of Slavic Military Studies \u201cRefreshingly crisp, pointed prose . . .

Proving he wasn't a WWII retread, he led the wing with aggressiveness, scoring another four confirmed kills, becoming a rare triple ace.

Despite a physical frailty, Eugene had an incredible talent for waging war and became, indisputably, one of the most successful military commanders in modern European history. His career spanned six decades and he served three emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. His first battle was fought against the Turks at the Siege of Vienna in 1689 and he subsequently took part in the War of the Holy League, the Nine Years War, against the Turks at Zenta and, most notably, as an ally of Marlborough's during the War of Spanish Succession against the French at Blenheim, Oudenarde and Malplaquet.

On D-Day at Tarawa his platoon waded their 37 mm cannons ashore, each weighing nearly 1,000 pounds, through half a mile of bullet-laced surf to get to an island where the killing never stopped. His was the only platoon to get its guns ashore and into action that first day. At Saipan, Elrod commanded a platoon of 75 mm halftracks, but he was riddled with shrapnel from an enemy artillery shell that took him out of the war. Fred H.

Unlike traditional biographies of combat leaders which focus primarily on military operations or regimental histories, the author concentrates on personal accounts, anecdotes and reminiscences in order to highlight these leaders` personalities, and to draw out the human face behind the military facade. The author argues that written records tend to glorify the actions of battalions as well as individuals, magnifying achievements while suppressing the mistakes and glossing over failures. This book, on the other hand, provides a truer picture of the strength of character and convictions of each of these leaders. The book throws new light on many historical events and the role of political leaders during India`s fight for independence and the partitioning of the subcontinent. The author gives an overview of India`s military history after independence, including major operations such as the wars with China in 1962, and with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971.

On September 15, 1944, the US First Marine Division landed on a small island in the Central Pacific called Peleliu as a prelude to the liberation of the Philippines. Among the first wave of Marines that hit the beach that day was twenty-two-year-old George Peto. Growing up on an Ohio farm, George always preferred being outdoors and exploring. This made school a challenge, but his hunting, fishing, and trapping skills helped put food on his family\u2019s table. As a poor teenager living in a rough area, he got into regular brawls, and he found holding down a job hard because of his wanderlust. After working out west with the CCC, he decided that joining the Marines offered him the opportunity for adventure, plus three square meals a day\u2014so he and his brother joined the Corps in 1941, just a few months before Pearl Harbor. Following boot camp and training, he was initially assigned to various guard units until he was shipped out to the Pacific and assigned to the 1st Marines. His first combat experience was the landing at Finschhaven, followed by Cape Gloucester. Then as a Forward Observer, he went ashore in one of the lead amtracs at Peleliu and saw fierce fighting for a week before the regiment was relieved due to massive casualties.

Dosal"], "publisher": "Penn State Press", "publishedDate": "2010-11-01", "description": "The victory of Fidel Castro&\u2019s rebel army in Cuba was due in no small part to the training, strategy, and leadership provided by Ernesto Che Guevara. Despite the deluge of biographies, memoirs, and documentaries that appeared in 1997 on the thirtieth anniversary of Guevara&\u2019s death, his military career remains shrouded in mystery. Comandante Che is the first book designed specifically to provide an objective evaluation of Guevara&\u2019s record as a guerrilla soldier, commander, and strategist from his first skirmish in Cuba to his defeat in Bolivia eleven years later. Using new evidence from Guevara&\u2019s previously unpublished campaign diaries and declassified CIA documents, Paul Dosal reassesses Guevara&\u2019s impact as a guerrilla warrior and theorist, comparing his accomplishments with those of other guerrilla leaders with whom he has been ranked, including Colonel T. E. Lawrence, Mao Tse-Tung, and General Vo Nguyen Giap. This reassessment reveals that Guevara was often underrated as a conventional military strategist, overrated as a guerrilla commander, and misrepresented as a guerrilla theorist. Guevara achieved his greatest military victory by applying a conventional military strategy in the final stages of the Cuban Revolution, orchestrating the defensive campaign that held off the Cuban army in the summer of 1958. As a guerrilla commander, he scored impressive victories in ambush after ambush in Bolivia, but in winning the battles he lost the war. He violated most of his own precepts during the Bolivian campaign, compelling analysts to question the validity of both his strategies and his command skills. Though he is credited with developing foco theory, Guevara never attempted to advance a new theory of guerrilla warfare. He was a fighter, not a theorist. He wanted to defeat American imperialism by launching guerrilla campaigns simultaneously in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but his tricontinental strategy resulted in failures first in the Congo and then in Bolivia.
