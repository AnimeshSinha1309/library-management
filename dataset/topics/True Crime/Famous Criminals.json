This book offers a critically-informed analysis and understanding of crime and criminal justice in contemporary Scotland. It considers key areas of criminal justice policy making in Scotland; in particular the extent to which criminal justice in Scotland is increasingly divergent from other UK jurisdictions as well as pressures that may lead to convergences in particular areas, for instance, in relation to trends in youth justice and penal policy. The book considers the extent to which Scottish crime and criminal justice is being affected both by devolution as well as the wider pressures resulting from globalization, Europeanisation and new patterns of migration. While the book has a Scottish focus, it also offers new ways of thinking about criminal justice \u2013 relating these issues to wider social divisions and inequalities in contemporary Scottish and UK society. It extends the \u2018gaze\u2019 and analysis of criminology by exploring issues such as environmental crime, urban disorder and the new urbanism as well as crimes of the rich and powerful and corporate crime, giving it a relevance and resonance far beyond Scotland. Criminal Justice in Scotland will be an essential text for students in Scotland taking courses in criminology, sociology, social policy, social sciences, law and police sciences, as well as criminal justice practitioners and policy makers in Scotland. It will also be an essential source for students of comparative criminology elsewhere and academics wishing to take Scotland into account in thinking about criminal justice in the UK.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781136681387"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1136681388"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT17&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-iZipAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Criminal_Justice_in_Scotland-sample-epub.acsm?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Criminal_Justice_in_Scotland-sample-pdf.acsm?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iZipAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Criminal</b>. justicein. contemporary.

Previous books and films, including the brilliant 1967 movie starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, have emphasized the supposed glamour of America's most notorious criminal couple, thus contributing to ongoing mythology. The real story is completely different -- and far more fascinating. In Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde, bestselling author Jeff Guinn combines exhaustive research with surprising, newly discovered material to tell the real tale of two kids from a filthy Dallas slum who fell in love and then willingly traded their lives for a brief interlude of excitement and, more important, fame. Their timing could not have been better -- the Barrow Gang pulled its first heist in 1932 when most Americans, reeling from the Great Depression, were desperate for escapist entertainment. Thanks to newsreels, true crime magazines, and new-fangled wire services that transmitted scandalous photos of Bonnie smoking a cigar to every newspaper in the nation, the Barrow Gang members almost instantly became household names on a par with Charles Lindbergh, Jack Dempsey, and Babe Ruth. In the minds of the public, they were cool, calculating bandits who robbed banks and killed cops with equal impunity. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Clyde and Bonnie were perhaps the most inept crooks ever, and their two-year crime spree was as much a reign of error as it was of terror. Lacking the sophistication to plot robberies of big-city banks, the Barrow Gang preyed mostly on small mom-and-pop groceries and service stations. Even at that, they often came up empty-handed and were reduced to breaking into gum machines for meal money. Both were crippled, Clyde from cutting off two of his toes while in prison and Bonnie from a terrible car crash caused by Clyde's reckless driving. Constantly on the run from the law, they lived like animals, camping out in their latest stolen car, bathing in creeks, and dining on cans of cold beans and Vienna sausages. Yet theirs was a genuine love story. Their devotion to each other was as real as their overblown reputation as criminal masterminds was not. Go Down Together has it all -- true romance, rebellion against authority, bullets flying, cars crashing, and, in the end, a dramatic death at the hands of a celebrity lawman hired to hunt them down. Thanks in great part to surviving Barrow and Parker family members and collectors of criminal memorabilia who provided Jeff Guinn with access to never-before-published material, we finally have the real story of Bonnie and Clyde and their troubled times, delivered with cinematic sweep and unprecedented insight by a masterful storyteller.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416557180"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1416557180"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 15, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VxmUv6xppf8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VxmUv6xppf8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VxmUv6xppf8C&pg=PA140&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VxmUv6xppf8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VxmUv6xppf8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1003, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 501.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VxmUv6xppf8C&rdid=book-VxmUv6xppf8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1003000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 501500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Go_Down_Together-sample-epub.acsm?id=VxmUv6xppf8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VxmUv6xppf8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Of course, criminal celebrity had its drawbacks. ...

And that means he gets to keep track of everyone coming in and out of Manod \u2013 what car they drive, what they're called, even their favourite flavour of crisps.

A story inspired by a press cutting describing how, during World War II, the treasured contents of London's National Gallery were stored in Welsh slate mines. Once a month, a morale-boosting masterpiece would be unveiled in the village and then returned to London for viewing.

Arguing against this carefully crafted pop image, Reva Wolf shows that Warhol was in fact deeply emotionally engaged with the people around him and that this was reflected in his art. Wolf investigates the underground culture of poets, artists, and filmmakers who interacted with Warhol regularly. She claims that Warhol understood the literary imagination of his generation and that recognizing Warhol's literary activities is essential to understanding his art. Drawing on a wealth of unpublished material, including interviews, personal and public archives, tape recordings, documentary photographs, and works of art, Wolf offers dramatic evidence that Warhol's interactions with writers functioned like an extended conversation and details how this process impacted his work.

In reality, the isolation was nearly impossible to maintain, and the lofty goals of the founders crumbled in the 20th century, much like the building itself. Originally located on the outskirts of Philadelphia, the city eventually expanded and swallowed up the prison. Its unique location became problematic, and numerous escapes and riots threatened the civilian populace in the area. The prison was home to such well-known figures as Chicago mob boss Al Capone and bank robber Willie Sutton, once the most wanted man in America.

Quirk", "William Schoell"], "publisher": "University Press of Kentucky", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13", "description": "\" Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography explores the life and career of one of Hollywood's great dames. She was a leading film personality for more than fifty years, from her beginnings as a dancer in silent films of the 1920s, to her portrayals of working-class shop girls in the Depression thirties, to her Oscar-winning performances in classic films such as Mildred Pierce. Crawford's legacy has become somewhat tarnished in the wake of her daughter Christina's memoir, Mommie Dearest, which turned her into a national joke. Today, many picture Crawford only as a wire hanger-wielding shrew rather than the personification of Hollywood glamour. This new biography of Crawford sets the record straight, going beyond the gossip to find the truth about the legendary actress. The authors knew Crawford well and conducted scores of interviews with her and many of her friends and co-stars, including Frank Capra, George Cukor, Nicholas Ray, and Sidney Greenstreet. Far from a whitewash -- Crawford was indeed a colorful and difficult character -- Joan Crawford corrects many lies and tells the story of one of Hollywood's most influential stars, complete with on-set anecdotes and other movie lore. Through extensive interviews, in-depth analysis, and evaluation of her films and performances -- both successes and failures -- Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoell present Crawford's story as both an appreciation and a reevaluation of her extraordinary life and career. Filled with new interviews, Joan Crawford tells the behind-the-scenes story of the Hollywood icon. Lawrence J. Quirk is the author of many books on film, including Bob Hope: The Road Well-Traveled.

It was, however, a period when those who argued that a British empire would be a disaster for liberty were eventually squashed by imperialists, just as those who railed against mindless materialism were in the end rolled over by industrialists and the promoters of luxury goods. The Making of Victorian Values reveals an era when people were obsessed with the need to appear authentic, and yet forever had doubts about who was and who wasn't-concerns familiar to the \"me\" age we know so well. Wilson begins with the libertine spirit inspired by Byron, Shelley, and the Romantics; he ends with the rise and eventual victory of stolid middle-class values. The result is a radical tour de force, a brilliant reworking of the pre-Victorian age. Once portrayed by Paul Johnson in his bestselling The Birth of the Modern as the years when virtue finally trumped corruption, Wilson reveals a far more compelling story-and a more engrossing and scandalous one, too. It is a story about hypochondriacs and cranks, killjoys and dandies, rakes and priests, advocates of free-speech and those against it-people who were made awe struck by Britain's emerging role as the economic and political powerhouse of the world, but who were also deeply anxious about the responsibilities a vast empire might require. Wilson is heir to the great radical historians of the twentieth century, E. J. Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson, among them. He brushes aside scholarly politesse and refuses to join in unnecessary academic point-settling, and his invigorating literary abilities will win many admirers who would otherwise know this history only through the works of nineteenth-century fiction.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781101218082"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1101218088"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "3.3.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sFWOROGjx8EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sFWOROGjx8EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sFWOROGjx8EC&pg=PT148&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sFWOROGjx8EC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sFWOROGjx8EC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 363.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 254.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sFWOROGjx8EC&rdid=book-sFWOROGjx8EC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 363090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 254160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Making_of_Victorian_Values-sample-epub.acsm?id=sFWOROGjx8EC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sFWOROGjx8EC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The \u201cblackguard\u201d or \u201cflash\u201d songs celebrated <b>famous criminals</b> or involved some <br>\nsort of sexual comedy.

Like the cowboy herding the dogies, they have cared little about the cost their activities imposed on others; what has mattered is the immediate benefit they have derived from their transformation of the land. Drawing on a recent flowering of scholarship on the western environment, western gender relations, minority history, and urban and labor history, as well as on more traditional western sources, It\u2019s Your Misfortune and None of My Own is about the creation of the region rather than the vanishing of the frontier. Richard White tells how the various parts of the West\u2014its distinct environments, its metropolitan areas and vast hinterlands, the various ethnic and racial groups and classes\u2014are held together by a series of historical relationships that are developed over time. Widespread aridity and a common geographical location between the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean would have provided but weak regional ties if other stronger relationships had not been created. A common dependence on the deferral government and common roots in a largely extractive and service-based economy were formative influences on western states and territories. A dual labor system based on race and the existence of minority groups with distinctive legal status have helped further define the region. Patterns of political participation and political organization have proved enduring. Together, these relationships among people, and between people and place, have made the West a historical creation and a distinctive region. From Europeans contact and subsequent Anglo-American conquest, through the civil-rights movement, the energy crisis, and the current reconstructing of the national and world economies, the West has remained a distinctive section in a much larger nation. In the American imagination the West still embodies possibilities inherent in the vastness and beauty of the place itself. But, Richard White explains, the possibilities many imagined for themselves have yielded to the possibilities seized by others. Many who thought themselves cowboys have in the end turned out to be dogies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780806148991"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0806148993"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 684, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT429&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2905.65, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2905.65, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-wdazBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2905650000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2905650000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/It_s_Your_Misfortune_and_None_of_My_Own-sample-epub.acsm?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/It_s_Your_Misfortune_and_None_of_My_Own-sample-pdf.acsm?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wdazBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Manymen honored after their deaths as social bandits, such asBilly theKid, were <br>\nsimple <b>criminals</b>, but some, like thenow <b>famous</b> Gregorio Cortez ofTexas, seem <br>\nindeedto have fulfilled the criteriafor social banditry.

He was raised in an Arab style house situated opposite the famous public al-Ward Bathhouse. This house stands there to the present day. Scholar Sheikho was still young when his father, the merchant Ismael Sheikho, departed this world. Mohammad Saleem, the only and elder brother of Mohammad Amin, was assigned as a director of the Military School during the Ottoman rule. Education At the age of twelve the boy who was to become the great scholar was enrolled at al-Rashidiya School, he then went on to complete his studies in Amber, the Royal Ottoman Faculty in Damascus. He received many certificates of praise and commendation during the Ottoman rule and then under the reign of King Faisal in Syria. There are many copies of these certificates still preserved in trustworthy hands. Achievements During the period of the Turkish rule, he was head of many police-stations in Damascus and its dependent counties. He was a shining example to all for his unfailing attention to duty, the vitality with which he approached every task, and the high level of achievement in many varied deeds which were of great benefit to mankind. During the French mandate he was appointed a director of the prisons of the citadel of Damascus. When the great Syrian uprising took place against the French forces, he helped the revolutionaries in every conceivable way until they placed the seal of the revolution in his trustworthy hands. Due to his subversive activities he fell foul of the French governor of Syria resulting in an order being issued for his execution; but the Almighty God saved him. During this period he was compliant in many attempts to overthrow French rule. He was the companion of Sheikh Amin Kuftaro for almost twenty years and following his death Scholar Sheikho followed his footsteps and became the next in succession to guide and teach the disciples of the eminent sheikh. His assemblies were distinguished by the profound level of wisdom with which he imparted his teaching and guidance. He took great care to draw the attention of his followers to beware of the tales of the Israelites which defame the biography of the noble persons, the Envoys of God (pth), and of anything ascribed to them which conflicts their perfection and impeccability. In 1953, the famous coeval philosopher, Sir John Godolphin Bennett came from Britain to visit him. He remained in his company for three weeks that were filled with lengthy dialogues about the religion of Islam and its actuality. Sir John asked Scholar Sheikho many questions about the exact definition of the \u2018spirit\u2019 and the difference between that and the \u2018soul\u2019, as well as asking for clarification about Godly Justice, a topic which he found difficult to comprehend. As a result of this visit, Sir John practised Islamic legislation and performed the prayers along with the followers of the scholar. This visit was referred to briefly in the autobiography of Sir John Bennett in his book Witness; but after his death, a book containing special personal recollections written by Sir John was published in 1975 under the title Journeys in Islamic Countries, wherein he spoke in detail about this meeting. In this book he gave a detailed account of the personality and character of Scholar Sheikho, and of his lectures and disciples. He also mentioned the great benefits he had derived from his life-changing meeting with the scholar. During his lectures Scholar Mohammad Amin Sheikho pointed frequently to the belief in the return of Jesus Christ (pth), from the Islamic perspective. He also indicated the near advent of this significant world event as, according to his explanations, most of the conditions for this momentous Hour had been fulfilled. This was disclosed in his book: The Envoy of Peace Looms on the Horizon: the Return of Jesus Christ. In referring to his meeting with Scholar Sheikho, Sir John made mention of this issue in his two books: Witness and Journeys in Islamic Countries. Professor Abdul-Kadir John, alias al-Dayrani, published the book Stories of the Scholar wherein he writes in detail about many deeds performed by his teacher, Mohammad Amin Sheikho. One of His Pupils Professor A. K. John, alias al-Dayrani is the best known and most distinguished among the pupils of Scholar Sheikho. He received a certificate of General Education (a Syrian certificate which included the study of nine different sciences). Prof. al-Dayrani collected and verified more than fifty books which were dictated by Scholar Sheikho and written on his behalf. Therefore his name is always mentioned in association with the name of Mohammad Amin Sheikho.", "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 338, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=krvoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=krvoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=krvoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=80&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=krvoAwAAQBAJ&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Stories_of_the_Scholar_Mohammad_Amin_She.html?hl=&id=krvoAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "ALL_PAGES", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Stories_of_the_Scholar_Mohammad_Amin_She-sample-epub.acsm?id=krvoAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Stories_of_the_Scholar_Mohammad_Amin_She-sample-pdf.acsm?id=krvoAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=krvoAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... his house when he caught sight of the massive head and huge muscular body <br>\nof a <b>well known</b> and powerful <b>criminal</b>. ...

Most books on 'global organized crime' focus on one particular region, topic or event, and are written from one specific theoretical and disciplinary framework. The renowned scholars who have contributed to this volume present up-to-date expertise on regions as distant and different as Russia, Colombia, the Netherlands, Israel, Peru and Britain. They tackle phenomena such as international drug trafficking, alien and women smuggling, terrorism, East European organized crime and financial crimes.

Here, Richard Wetzell presents the first history of German criminology from Imperial Germany through the Weimar Republic to the end of the Third Reich, a period that provided a unique test case for the perils associated with biological explanations of crime. Drawing on a wealth of primary sources from criminological, legal, and psychiatric literature, Wetzell shows that German biomedical research on crime predominated over sociological research and thus contributed to the rise of the eugenics movement and the eventual targeting of criminals for eugenic measures by the Nazi regime. However, he also demonstrates that the development of German criminology was characterized by a constant tension between the criminologists' hereditarian biases and an increasing methodological sophistication that prevented many of them from endorsing the crude genetic determinism and racism that characterized so much of Hitler's regime. As a result, proposals for the sterilization of criminals remained highly controversial during the Nazi years, suggesting that Nazi biological politics left more room for contention than has often been assumed.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780807861042"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0807861049"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 376, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.5.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dkf1AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dkf1AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dkf1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dkf1AwAAQBAJ&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Inventing_the_Criminal.html?hl=&id=Dkf1AwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Inventing_the_Criminal-sample-epub.acsm?id=Dkf1AwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Dkf1AwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "As a result, moral statistics and studies of the <b>criminal</b> classes played a far <br>\ngreater role than medical theories in laying the foundations of ...

The title of the book, An American Dilemma, refers to the moral contradiction of a nation torn between allegiance to its highest ideals and awareness of the base realities of racial discrimination. The touchstone of this classic is the jarring discrepancy between the American creed of respect for the inalienable rights to freedom, justice, and opportunity for all and the pervasive violations of the dignity of blacks. The appendices are a gold mine of information, theory, and methodology. Indeed, two of the appendices were issued as a separate work given their importance for systematic theory in social research. The new introduction by Sissela Bok offers a remarkably intimate yet rigorously objective appraisal of Myrdal-a social scientist who wanted to see himself as an analytic intellectual, yet had an unbending desire to bring about change. An American Dilemma is testimonial to the man as well as the ideas he espoused. When It first appeared An American Dilemma was called \"the most penetrating and important book on contemporary American civilizations by Robert S. Lynd; \"One of the best political commentaries on American life that has ever been written\" in The American Political Science Review; and a book with \"a novelty and a courage seldom found in American discussions either of our total society or of the part which the Negro plays in it\" in The American Sociological Review.

Contemporary concerns such as bilingualism, incorporation/assimilation, dual identity, ethnic politics, quotas and affirmative action, residential segregation, and the volume of immigration resonate with a past that has confronted variations of these modern issues. The Columbia Documentary History of Race and Ethnicity in America, written and compiled by a highly respected team of American historians under the editorship of Ronald Bayor, illuminates the myriad ways in which immigration, racial, and ethnic histories have shaped the contours of contemporary American society. This invaluable resource documents all eras of the American past, including black\u2013white interactions and the broad spectrum of American attitudes and reactions concerning Native Americans, Irish Catholics, Mexican Americans, Jewish Americans, and other groups. Each of the eight chronological chapters contains a survey essay, an annotated bibliography, and 20 to 30 related public and private primary source documents, including manifestos, speeches, court cases, letters, memoirs, and much more. From the 1655 petition of Jewish merchants regarding the admission of Jews to the New Netherlands colony to an interview with a Chinese American worker regarding a 1938 strike in San Francisco, documents are drawn from a variety of sources and allow students and others direct access to our past.

With drugs and cyber-crime as her main examples Professor Mumford shows how these topical, yet apparently permanent problems, could be approached. She does this by looking at how the criminals themselves have overcome legal obstacles, and other problems to make the drug trafficking industry the second largest in the world today, and the relative newcomer, electronic fraud, a multi-billion dollar problem already. These crimes, which in themselves lead to more crime from petty theft to support a drug habit, to international money laundering, are incredibly complex, and yet the book shows us that there is not only a way forward with these issues, but a way to approach all complex problems with efficiency and competency, wherever they occur in our lives.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306461422"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306461420"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 233, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z9RyicIxgh0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z9RyicIxgh0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=z9RyicIxgh0C&pg=PA188&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=z9RyicIxgh0C&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dangerous_Decisions.html?hl=&id=z9RyicIxgh0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dangerous_Decisions-sample-epub.acsm?id=z9RyicIxgh0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dangerous_Decisions-sample-pdf.acsm?id=z9RyicIxgh0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=z9RyicIxgh0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The best place to hide money is a corrupt bank and the Bank of Credit and <br>\nCommerce International (BCCI) in the United States became <b>famous</b> for its three <br>\nthousand <b>criminal</b> customers.

In vivid detail, he reconstructs a series of dramatic, often harrowing, cases in which women were involved and puts their acts in the context of their times. Taking episodes from the eighteenth century to near the present day, he looks at criminal women of all types, from all walks of life. The work of the London police, the courts, and the prisons is an essential element in his study, and each chapter reveals much about how attitudes toward crime and punishment have changed over the centuries. Fascinating portraits of these criminal women as individuals emerge from their stories; their cases come to life\u2014as does the London in which they lived. They include Catherine Hayes, who was burnt alive for murdering her husband; three women hanged on the same day for highway robbery; two women executed for rioting; Anne Hurle and Charlotte Newman, who were both hanged for forgery; Florence Bravo, who was sensationally acquitted of murder; and, perhaps most famous of all, Ruth Ellis, whose execution in 1955 provoked an outcry against capital punishment.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781844683284"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1844683281"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 279.66, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 195.76, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 279660000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 195760000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Criminal_Women-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Criminal_Women-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZcSIDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The work of the London police, the courts, and the prisons is an essential element in his study, and each chapter reveals much about how attitudes toward crime and punishment have changed over the centuries."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "jm-qe9MqoYgC", "etag": "RA/IVek7AZc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jm-qe9MqoYgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Seeing Europe with Famous Authors", "subtitle": "Volum", "authors": ["Francis W.

It is a place where history has been made for thousands of years, and where it is still being made today. It is not a city frozen in time, preserved in its ancient medieval pomp but a place that has been at or near the centre of national life for a thousand years and at the forefront of international political, cultural and economic history for each of the past five centuries. Here Stephen Inwood, bestselling author of A History of London, and a lifelong student of the city's rich and vibrant history, offers an explorer's guide to London's past. As you walk the streets of the capital, whether you live in the city or are just visiting it, Inwood will show you London's history all around you: stretches of Roman wall; medieval churches and Tudor houses that survived the Great Fire; monastic buildings that survived the Reformation; street markets first established centuries ago that survive today; Georgian streets and squares that were spared the wreckers' ball; Wren churches; Victorian terraces and Inns of Court that survived the Blitz. He takes you to the London of Chaucer and Shakespeare, Samuels Pepys and Johnson; Dickens and Darwin, T.S Eliot and George Orwell.

Kearns"], "publisher": "Gill & Macmillan Ltd", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03", "description": "Garda and guardian. Protector and punisher. This is \u2018Lugs\u2019 Branigan: the man, the legend. The story of \u2018Lugs\u2019 Branigan is a tale that is long overdue. It is a story of extraordinary courage and compassion, a story of heroism and altruism, a story of crime, punishment and redemption. The legend of \u2018Lugs\u2019\u2019s career as Ireland\u2019s most famous garda (police officer), founded on his physical strength and the manner in which he faced up to the criminal gangs of Dublin over the course of fifty years, is part of Dublin\u2019s folk history. In The Legendary \u2018Lugs\u2019 Branigan, bestselling historian Kevin C. Kearns presents a revealing and unvarnished portrait of the man and his life, authenticated by the oral testimony of family members, friends and Garda mates who stood with him through the most harrowing and poignant experiences. Born in the Liberties of Dublin in 1910, Jim Branigan was, by his own admission, a shy, scrawny \u2018sissy\u2019 as a lad. Cruelly beaten by bullies in the railway yard where he worked during his teens, he refused to fight back. Yet he went on to become a heavyweight boxing champion and to earn the \u2018undisputed reputation as the country's toughest and bravest garda\u2019. Chief Superintendent Edmund Doherty proclaimed him \u2018one of those people who become a legend in his own time\u2019. As a garda he refused to carry a baton, relying upon his fists. He took on the vicious \u2018animal gangs\u2019 of the 1930s and 40s and in the \u2018Battle of Baldoyle\u2019 broke their reign of terror. In the 1950s he quelled the wild \u2018rock-and-roll riots\u2019 and tamed the ruffian Teddy boys with their flick-knives. All the while, he was dealing with Dublin's full array of gurriers and criminals. As a devotee of American Western films and books, Branigan emulated the sheriffs by doling out his unique \u2018showdown\u2019 brand of summary justice to hooligans and thugs on the street. In the 1960s his riot squad with its Garda \u2018posse\u2019 patrolled Dublin's roughest districts in their \u2018black Maria\u2019. They contended with the most dangerous rows and riots in the streets, dancehalls and pubs. The cry \u2018Lugs is here!\u2019 could instantly scatter a disorderly crowd. Ironically, for all his fame as a tough, fearless garda, he was most beloved for his humanity and compassion. His role as guardian of the battered women of the tenements and as protector and father figure of the city's piteous prostitutes\u2014or \u2018pavement hostesses\u2019, as he called them\u2014was unrecorded in the press and hushed up by the Garda brass. Yet, Garda John Collins vouches, \u2018Women \u2026 oh, he was God to them!\u2019 Upon retirement he entered his \u2018old gunfighter\u2019 years; ageing and vulnerable, he became a target for old foes bent on revenge and for \u2018young guns\u2019 seeking a quick reputation. A man with a reputation powerful enough to echo through generations of Dubliners, the legendary \u2018Lugs\u2019 Branigan finally has a book worthy of his story.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780717159376"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "071715937X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PP349&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 262.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 183.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 262080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 183460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Legendary_Lugs_Branigan_Ireland_s_Mo-sample-epub.acsm?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Legendary_Lugs_Branigan_Ireland_s_Mo-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Kkt_BAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Various papers referred to him as \u201ca former heavyweight boxing champion,\u201d <br>\n<b>famous</b> \u201cgang-buster,\u201d and one-man deterrent against thugs and <b>criminals</b>. <br>\nBranigan&#39;s first responsibility was to select an elite team.

Was a search legal? Was the evidence obtained lawfully? Did the police follow the rules in pursuing their case? While the show depicts fictional cases and scenarios, police procedure with regard to search and seizure is a real and significant issue in the criminal justice system today. The subject of many Supreme Court decisions, they seriously impact the way police pursue their investigations, the way prosecutors proceed with their cases, and the way defense attorneys defend their clients. This book answers these questions and explains these decisions in accessible and easy to follow language. Each chapter explores a separate case or series of cases involving the application of the Fourth Amendment to current police investigatory practices or prosecutorial conduct of the criminal trial. The police-related cases involve topics such as searches of suspects (both prior and incident to arrest), pretext stops, the knock-and-announce rule, interrogation procedures, and the parameters of an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy. The prosecutor-related cases involve topics such as jury selection, the right to counsel, and sentencing. This important overview serves as an introduction to the realities and practicalities of police investigation and the functioning of the criminal justice system when search and seizure becomes an issue.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1442201584"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781442201583"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 382,

Why do street criminals get stiff prison sentences, a practice that has led to the disaster of mass incarceration, while white-collar criminals, who arguably harm more people, get slaps on the wrist--if they are prosecuted at all? In Who Are the Criminals?, one of America's leading criminologists provides new answers to these vitally important questions by telling how the politicization of crime in the twentieth century transformed and distorted crime policymaking and led Americans to fear street crime too much and corporate crime too little. John Hagan argues that the recent history of American criminal justice can be divided into two eras--the age of Roosevelt (roughly 1933 to 1973) and the age of Reagan (1974 to 2008). A focus on rehabilitation, corporate regulation, and the social roots of crime in the earlier period was dramatically reversed in the later era. In the age of Reagan, the focus shifted to the harsh treatment of street crimes, especially drug offenses, which disproportionately affected minorities and the poor and resulted in wholesale imprisonment. At the same time, a massive deregulation of business provided new opportunities, incentives, and even rationalizations for white-collar crime--and helped cause the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession. The time for moving beyond Reagan-era crime policies is long overdue, Hagan argues. The understanding of crime must be reshaped and we must reconsider the relative harms and punishments of street and corporate crimes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781400836314"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "140083631X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 314, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&pg=PA26&dq=Famous+Criminals&hl=&cd=114&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2241.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2241.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&rdid=book--aQrFtbZE1sC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2241200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2241200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Who_Are_the_Criminals-sample-epub.acsm?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Who_Are_the_Criminals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-aQrFtbZE1sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... which to a large degree is the case in criminology and <b>criminal</b> justice studies, <br>\nthen it is rather likely that academically ...
