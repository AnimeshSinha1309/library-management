It is the interface between the hardware and computer users making the computer a pleasant device to use. \"The Operating System: Concepts and Techniques\" clearly defines and explains the concepts: process (responsibility, creation, living, and termination), thread (responsibility, creation, living, and termination), multiprogramming, multiprocessing, scheduling, memory management (non-virtual and virtual), interprocess communication/synchronization (busy-wait-based, semaphore-based, and message-based), deadlock, and starvation. Real-life techniques presented are based on UNIX, Linux, and contemporary Windows. The book has briefly discussed agent-based operating systems, macro-kernel, microkernel, extensible kernels, distributed, and real-time operating systems. The book is for everyone who is using a computer but is still not at ease with the way the operating system manages programs and available resources in order to perform requests correctly and speedily. High school and university students will benefit the most, as they are the ones who turn to computers for all sorts of activities, including email, Internet, chat, education, programming, research, playing games etc. It is especially beneficial for university students of Information Technology, Computer Science and Engineering.

By using several innovative tools, Stallings makes it possible to understand critical core concepts that can be fundamentally challenging. The new edition includes the implementation of web based animations to aid visual learners. At key points in the book, students are directed to view an animation and then are provided with assignments to alter the animation input and analyze the results. The concepts are then enhanced and supported by end-of-chapter case studies of UNIX, Linux and Windows Vista. These provide students with a solid understanding of the key mechanisms of modern operating systems and the types of design tradeoffs and decisions involved in OS design.

Approaches to implementing support mechanisms and to incorporating additional appropriate levels of fault detection and fault tolerance at the processor, network, and operating system level are presented. A primary concern at these levels is balancing cost and performance against coverage and overall dependability. As these chapters demonstrate, low overhead, practical solutions are attainable and not necessarily incompatible with performance considerations. The section on innovative compiler support, in particular, demonstrates how the benefits of application specificity may be obtained while reducing hardware cost and run-time overhead. A companion to this volume (published by Kluwer) subtitled Models and Frameworks for Dependable Systems presents two comprehensive frameworks for reasoning about system dependability, thereby establishing a context for understanding the roles played by specific approaches presented in this book's two companion volumes. It then explores the range of models and analysis methods necessary to design, validate and analyze dependable systems. Another companion to this book (published by Kluwer), subtitled Paradigms for Dependable Applications, presents a variety of specific approaches to achieving dependability at the application level. Driven by the higher level fault models of Models and Frameworks for Dependable Systems, and built on the lower level abstractions implemented in a third companion book subtitled System Implementation, these approaches demonstrate how dependability may be tuned to the requirements of an application, the fault environment, and the characteristics of the target platform. Three classes of paradigms are considered: protocol-based paradigms for distributed applications, algorithm-based paradigms for parallel applications, and approaches to exploiting application semantics in embedded real-time control systems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780585280028"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0585280029"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 321, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC&pg=PA215&dq=Operating+System+computers&hl=&cd=54&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC&rdid=book-4WHQL-P8GjsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Foundations_of_Dependable_Computing-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4WHQL-P8GjsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Since <b>operating systems</b> are common to all <b>computers</b> and it is at the <b>operating</b> <br>\n<b>system</b> level where there is maximum system visibility and control, it is <br>\nappropriate for the <b>operating system</b> to provide policies which detect, contain and <br>\ntolerate&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "7a1QAAAAYAAJ", "etag": "DMbOJNlTSIo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7a1QAAAAYAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Real world UNIX", "subtitle": "managing a business with the UNIX operating system", "authors": ["John D.

Since the 1960s, operating systems designers have explored how to build\"secure\" operating systems - operating systems whose mechanisms protect the system against a motivated adversary. Recently, the importance of ensuring such security has become a mainstream issue for all operating systems. In this book, we examine past research that outlines the requirements for a secure operating system and research that implements example systems that aim for such requirements. For system designs that aimed to satisfy these requirements,we see that the complexity of software systems often results in implementation challenges that we are still exploring to this day. However, if a system design does not aim for achieving the secure operating system requirements, then its security features fail to protect the system in a myriad of ways. We also study systems that have been retro-fit with secure operating system features after an initial deployment. In all cases, the conflict between function on one hand and security on the other leads to difficult choices and the potential for unwise compromises. From this book, we hope that systems designers and implementers will learn the requirements for operating systems that effectively enforce security and will better understand how to manage the balance between function and security.\"--BOOK JACKET.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781598292121"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1598292129"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 218, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Operating+System+computers&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2596, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2596, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&rdid=book-P4PYPSv8nBMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2596000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2596000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Operating_System_Security-sample-epub.acsm?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Operating_System_Security-sample-pdf.acsm?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In this book, we examine past research that outlines the requirements for a secure operating system and research that implements example systems that aim for such requirements."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AAnzJXtXQTUC", "etag": "uiFzPLTfqcA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AAnzJXtXQTUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Local Area Network Handbook, Sixth Edition", "authors": ["John P.

In a few short years, LANs have become an essential element of today's business environment. This time in the spotlight, while well deserved, has not come without a price. Businesses now insist that LANs deliver vast and ever-increasing quantities of business-critical information and that they do it efficiently, flawlessly, without fail, and most of all, securely. Today's network managers must consistently deliver this level of performance, and must do so while keeping up with ever changing, ever increasing demands without missing a beat. At the same time, today's IT managers must deliver business-critical information systems in an environment that has undergone radical paradigm shifts in such widely varied fields as computer architecture, operating systems, application development, and security. The Local Area Networks Handbook focuses on this collective environment, in which networking and information technology work together to create LAN-based enterprise networks. Topics have been selected and organized with this in mind, providing both depth and breadth of coverage. The handbook will provide you not only an understanding of how LANs work and how to go about selecting and implementing LAN products, but also of how to leverage LAN capabilities for the benefit of your enterprise.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "084939838X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780849398384"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 696, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AAnzJXtXQTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AAnzJXtXQTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AAnzJXtXQTUC&pg=PA343&dq=Operating+System+computers&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AAnzJXtXQTUC&dq=Operating+System+computers&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Local_Area_Network_Handbook_Sixth_Editio.html?hl=&id=AAnzJXtXQTUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AAnzJXtXQTUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "John P.

In the authors' years of experience in working with attorneys as digital forensics experts, common questions arise again and again: \u201cWhat do I ask for?? \u201cIs the evidence relevant?? \u201cWhat does this item in the forensic report mean?? \u201cWhat should I ask the other expert?? \u201cWhat should I ask you?? \u201cCan you explain that to a jury?? This book answers many of those questions in clear language that is understandable by non-technical people. With many illustrations and diagrams that will be usable in court, they explain technical concepts such as unallocated space, forensic copies, timeline artifacts and metadata in simple terms that make these concepts accessible to both attorneys and juries. The authors also explain how to determine what evidence to ask for, evidence might be that could be discoverable, and the methods for getting to it including relevant subpoena and motion language. Additionally, this book provides an overview of the current state of digital forensics, the right way to select a qualified expert, what to expect from a qualified expert and how to properly use experts before and during trial. Includes a companion Web site with: courtroom illustrations, and examples of discovery motions Provides examples of direct and cross examination questions for digital evidence Contains a reference of

This web page does well to compliment the book which gives excellent explanations of what the animations are showing. Combining the books explanations with the animation provides a well rounded understanding of the animated computer. This book and web page are about the many hardware and software aspects of computing. It covers the design of circuits, logical gates, data and data storage, counting and arithmetic, buses and bus designs, network connectivity, the CPU and its design, the computers instruction set, the modern use of microprocessing, assembly language and the interpretation of human readable computer code, the activities of the operating system, and computer peripherals. There is a lot to cover so the book is quite intense. The web page offers a new dimension to the book. But it is easy to read; and you can read it at your own pace (unless this is part of a course - then the professor sets the pace). It is meant as a preparation for research, development, design, building, and testing of computer equipment. The book is about how computers and parts of computers are designed and how connecting these part together makes the computer capable of processing internally held instructions that can run the computer independently. This covers how data and instructions are processed, stored, and communicated by computers. This also concerns how data is communicated among electronic components, and how software is written and compiled. Finally - This textbook is a comprehensive work and provides a basis for a detailed understanding of how the computer works. Descriptions include detailed drawings that clarify what the text is talking about. Everyone can read this book as the book is written for easy understanding. But the book is quite detailed in the coverage of computer design issues. I think you will enjoy reading it and it will inform you about computer design as no other textbook can. The book can be easily understood by anyone who takes the time to study each of the diagrams and its description.

It is a first-hand product of many of the leaders in this rapidly evolving field and possibly the most comprehensive. This new and important book masterfully presents the major alternative concepts driving the future of operating system design for high performance computing. In particular, it describes the major advances of monolithic operating systems such as Linux and Unix that dominate the TOP500 list. It also presents the state of the art in lightweight kernels that exhibit high efficiency and scalability at the loss of generality. Finally, this work looks forward to possibly the most promising strategy of a hybrid structure combining full service functionality with lightweight kernel operation.

This book, designed for those who are taking introductory courses on operating systems, presents both theoretical and practical aspects of modern operating systems. Although the emphasis is on theory, while exposing you (the reader) the subject matter, this book maintains a balance between theory and practice. The theories and technologies that have fueled the evolution of operating systems are primarily geared towards two goals: user convenience in maneuvering computers and efficient utilization of hardware resources. This book also discusses many fundamental concepts that have been formulated over the past several decades and that continue to be used in many modern operating systems. In addition, this book also discusses those technologies that prevail in many modern operating systems such as UNIX, Solaris, Linux, and Windows. While the former two have been used to present many in-text examples, the latter two are dealt with as separate technological case studies. They highlight the various issues in the design and development of operating systems and help you correlate theories to technologies. This book also discusses Android exposing you a modern software platform for embedded devices. This book supersedes ISBN 9788131730225 and its other derivatives, from Pearson Education India.

Already more than six years have passed since the project was put in motion. The TRON Association is now made up of over 140 co m panies and organizations, including 25 overseas firms or their affiliates. A basic goal of TRON Project activities is to offer the world a human-oriented computer culture, that will lead to a richer and more fulfilling life for people throughout the world. It is our desire to bring to reality a new order in the world of computers, based on design concepts that consider the needs of human beings first of all, and to enable people to enjoy the full benefits of these com puters in their daily life. Thanks to the efforts of Association members, in recent months a number of TRON-specification 32-bit microprocessors have been made available. ITRON-specification products are continuing to appear, and we are now seeing commercial implementations of BTRON specifications as well.
