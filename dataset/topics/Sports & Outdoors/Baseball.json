The first two volumes of this study -The Early Years and The Golden Age -won universal acclaim. The New York Times wrote that they \"will grip every American who has invested part of his youth and dreams in the sport,\" while The Boston Globe called them \"irresistible.\" Now, in The People's Game, the authors offer the first book devoted entirely to the history of the game outside of the professional leagues, revealing how, from its early beginnings up to World War II, baseball truly became the great American pastime. They explore the bond between baseball and boys through the decades, the game's place in institutions from colleges to prisons to the armed forces, the rise of women's baseball that coincided with nineteenth century feminism, and the struggles of black players and clubs from the later years of slavery up to the Second World War. Whether discussing the birth of softball or the origins of the seventh inning stretch, the Seymours enrich their extensive research with fascinating details and entertaining anecdotes as well as a wealth of baseball experience. The People's Game brings to life the central role of baseball for generations of Americans. Note: On August 2, 2010, Oxford University Press made public that it would credit Dorothy Seymour Mills as co-author of the three baseball histories previously \"authored\" solely by her late husband, Harold Seymour.

The Early Years, traces the growth of baseball from the time of the first recorded ball game at Valley Forge during the revolution until the formation of the two present-day major leagues in 1903. By investigating previously unknown sources, the book uncovers the real story of how baseball evolved from a gentleman's amateur sport of \"well-bred play followed by well-laden banquet tables\" into a professional sport where big leagues operate under their own laws. Offering countless anecdotes and a wealth of new information, the authors explode many cherished myths, including the one which claims that Abner Doubleday \"invented\" baseball in 1839. They describe the influence of baseball on American business, manners, morals, social institutions, and even show business, as well as depicting the types of men who became the first professional ball players, club owners, and managers, including Spalding, McGraw, Comiskey, and Connie Mack.

On one side of the argument were the owners, who wanted to take in more money, and working people, who labored six days a week and wanted to take in a baseball game on the seventh. On the other side were people who thought that the commandment to keep Sunday sacred ought to be obeyed. The story of how Sunday baseball went from being an illegal activity in most areas of the country in 1876 to a legal form of entertainment in all major league cities by 1934 is told in this work. It describes the numerous schemes used to play baseball on Sunday, like playing games in strange places, under odd circumstances and at the inconvenience of players and managers, many of whom were arrested and jailed for attempting to play baseball on Sunday. The book covers the foothold Sunday baseball gained in cities like St. Louis, Cincinnati and Chicago in the 1880s and 1890s, its slow spread eastward as the general attitude of the populace toward Sunday baseball gradually changed, and its widespread acceptance after New York passed a law in 1919 making it legal.

David Block looks into the early history of the game and of the 150-year-old debate about its beginnings. He tackles one stubborn misconception after another, debunking the enduring belief that baseball descended from the English game of rounders and revealing a surprising new explanation for the most notorious myth of all?the Abner Doubleday?Cooperstown story. \u00f8 Block?s book takes readers on an exhilarating journey through the centuries in search of clues to the evolution of our modern National Pastime. Among his startling discoveries is a set of long-forgotten baseball rules from the 1700s. Block evaluates the originality and historical significance of the Knickerbocker rules of 1845, revisits European studies on the ancestry of baseball which indicate that the game dates back hundreds, if not thousands of years, and assembles a detailed history of games and pastimes from the Middle Ages onward that contributed to baseball?s development.

While the Bears of yesteryear merit considerable attention, the return of the team under the leadership of former Yankee Rick Cerone offers an added ingredient to the story. As part of the city's recent renaissance, the return of the Bears played a critical role in reviving the city's downtown district and attracting people to Newark for an evening's entertainment.

In \"The Women's Game\" the legacy of Title IX is explored, along with gender constructions at the time of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Teams and their towns are the focus of \"Baseball and Community\"; essays deal with Dodgertown and Vero Beach, baseball and advertising in Brooklyn, and the baseball identity of a mining town in New Mexico. In \"Baseball Ideology\" the game's films, wartime rhetoric, and the approaches to its ethnic history are investigated. Essays in \"Biography: Baseball Lives\" relate the true stories of a Depression-era felon treated to a World Series game at Wrigley and the post-Katrina struggles of pitching great Mel Parnell.

Baseball historian David Nemec presents complete team rosters and detailed player, manager, and umpire information, with a wealth of statistics to warm a fan\u2019s heart. Sidebars cover a variety of topics, from oddities\u2014the team that had the best record but finished second\u2014to analyses of why Cleveland didn\u2019t win any pennants in the 1890s. Additional benefits include dozens of rare illustrations and narrative accounts of each year\u2019s pennant race. Nemec also carefully charts the rule changes from year to year as the game developed by fits and starts to formulate the modern rules. The result is an essential work of reference and at the same time a treasury of baseball history.

But, according to Michael Butterworth, such favorable rhetoric belies baseball's complicity in the rhetorical construction of a world defined by good and evil. \"This book is sure to make a splash in sports history, the sociology of sport, American studies, U.S. history, and communication studies. One reason it works so well is because of [Butterworth's] mix of profound affection for his topics (the United States and the sport) with a deep sense of disappointment/hope. This combination kept me riveted from the moment I began reading---bravo!\"---Toby Miller, author of Cultural Citizenship: Cosmopolitanism, Consumerism, and Television in a Neoliberal Age Baseball and Rhetorics of Purity is an investigation into the culture and mythology of baseball, a study of its limits and failures, and an invitation to remake the game in a more democratic way. It pays special attention to baseball's role in the reconstruction of American identity after September 11, 2001. This study is framed by a discussion that links the development of baseball to the discourses of innocence and purity in 19th-century America. From there, it examines ritual performances at baseball games; a traveling museum exhibit sponsored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum; the recent debate about the use of performance-enhancing drugs; the return of Major League Baseball to Washington, D.

Butterworth argues that baseball cannot be viewed as an innocent diversion or escape and that by promoting myths of citizenship and purity, post-9/11 discourse concerning baseball ironically threatens the health of the democratic system. Instead, he highlights how the game on the field reflects a more complex and diverse worldview, and he makes a plea for the game's recovery, both as a national pastime and as a site for celebrating the best of who we are and who we can be.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780817317102"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0817317104"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 233, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xv73owGa3IMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xv73owGa3IMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xv73owGa3IMC&pg=PA80&dq=Baseball&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xv73owGa3IMC&dq=Baseball&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Baseball_and_Rhetorics_of_Purity.html?hl=&id=Xv73owGa3IMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Xv73owGa3IMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Steroids and the Rhetorical Cleansing of <b>Baseball Baseball</b> and the media want <br>\nscapegoats. \u2014Dave Zirin When Mark McGwire became eligible for election to the <br>\nNational <b>Baseball</b> Hall of fame in 2007, the subsequent vote by the <b>Baseball</b>&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CmBeaQn57KYC", "etag": "MAN0wcZf8s8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CmBeaQn57KYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How to Make Pro Baseball Scouts Notice You", "subtitle": "An Insider's Guide to Big League Scouting", "authors": ["Al Goldis", "John Wolff"], "publisher": "Skyhorse Publishing Inc.", "publishedDate": "2009-01-01", "description": "Al Goldis has spent more than forty years as a major league scout, having worked in the front offices of the Cincinnati Reds, Baltimore Orioles, Anaheim Angels, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Cubs, and New York Mets. In those forty years he has seen and signed some of the game?s greatest talents. As the Scouting Director of the Chicago White Sox in the late 1980s, Goldis spearheaded the amateur drafts that brought future All-Stars Frank Thomas, Robin Ventura, and Jack McDowell into the Sox organization. After so many years scouting young players, Goldis has a pretty good idea what to look for in a player beyond the commonly accepted standard of the?five tools? (hitting for average, hitting for power, a strong throwing arm, excellent defensive skills, and speed on the basepaths). And in How to Make Pro Scouts Notice You, he and former pro ballplayer John Wolff have set out to create a blueprint for young ballplayers with big league aspirations to follow. The purpose of the book is twofold: one, to give young ballplayers an inside look at what scouts are really looking for in their search for professional-caliber ballplayers; and two, to help them market and sell themselves so that those scouts will know they exist and see them put their best skills on display. How to Make Pro Scouts Notice You is written with the intent of helping young ballplayers keep their dreams of playing pro ball alive and flourishing.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781602396845"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1602396841"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 129, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CmBeaQn57KYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CmBeaQn57KYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CmBeaQn57KYC&pg=PA20&dq=Baseball&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CmBeaQn57KYC&dq=Baseball&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Make_Pro_Baseball_Scouts_Notice_Y.html?hl=&id=CmBeaQn57KYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_to_Make_Pro_Baseball_Scouts_Notice_Y-sample-epub.acsm?id=CmBeaQn57KYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_to_Make_Pro_Baseball_Scouts_Notice_Y-sample-pdf.acsm?id=CmBeaQn57KYC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CmBeaQn57KYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "For the professional <b>baseball</b> scout, finding a \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d\u2014the kid <br>\nwho everybody else passed over that becomes a superstar\u2014is a dream come <br>\ntrue.

From the time that Louis Sockalexis stepped onto a Major League Baseball field in 1897, American Indians have had a presence in professional baseball. Unfortunately, it has not always been welcomed or respected, and Native athletes have faced racist stereotypes, foul epithets, and abuse from fans and players throughout their careers. The American Indian Integration of Baseball describes the experiences and contributions of American Indians as they courageously tried to make their place in America?s national game during the first half of the twentieth century. Jeffrey Powers-Beck provides biographical profiles of forgotten Native players such as Elijah Pinnance, George Johnson, Louis Leroy, and Moses Yellow Horse, along with profiles of better-known athletes such as Jim Thorpe, Charles Albert Bender, and John Tortes Meyers. Combining analysis of popular-press accounts with records from boarding schools for Native youth, where baseball was used as a tool of assimilation, Powers-Beck shows how American Indians battled discrimination and racism to integrate American baseball.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780803237452"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0803237456"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 269, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zSfScm63CoYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zSfScm63CoYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zSfScm63CoYC&pg=PA51&dq=Baseball&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zSfScm63CoYC&dq=Baseball&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_American_Indian_Integration_of_Baseb.html?hl=&id=zSfScm63CoYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zSfScm63CoYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Baseball</b>.

Yet until the late 1980s few professional teams actively scouted and developed players there. This book is about the man who changed all that and brought Venezuela into Major League Baseball in a major way. While other teams were looking to the Dominican Republic for new talent, Houston Astros' scout Andr\u00e9s Reiner saw an untapped niche in Venezuela. Venezuelan Bust, Baseball Boom recounts how, over the next fifteen years, Reiner signed nearly one hundred players, nineteen of whom reached the majors. The stories of these players among them Bobby Abreu, Joh\u00e1n Santana, Melvin Mora, Carlos Guill\u00e9n, and Freddy Garc\u00eda are interwoven with Reiner s own, together creating a fascinating portrait of a curious character in the annals of sports and a richly textured picture of the opening of Venezuela as baseball s new frontier. Countless interviews broaden and deepen the story s insights into how the scouting system works, how Reiner worked within it, and how his efforts have affected the sport of baseball in Venezuela and the significance of Venezuela in the world of Major League Baseball.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780803217423"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0803217420"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 257, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&pg=PA14&dq=Baseball&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1405.49, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 702.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&rdid=book-JdeQIBz8zSUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1405490000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 702740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Venezuelan_Bust_Baseball_Boom-sample-epub.acsm?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Venezuelan_Bust_Baseball_Boom-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JdeQIBz8zSUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "It was not a battle in a conflict between the two countries but a celebration of <br>\nVenezuela&#39;s unexpected victory over Cuba in the championship game of the <br>\n1941 World Amateur <b>Baseball</b> tournament.

At the end of World War II, soldiers returning from overseas hungered to resume their love affair with baseball. Spectators still identified with players, whose salaries and off-season employment as postmen, plumbers, farmers, and insurance salesmen resembled their own. It was a time when kids played baseball on sandlots and in pastures, fans followed the game on the radio, and tickets were affordable. The outstanding play of Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Ted Williams, Bob Feller, Don Newcombe, Warren Spahn, and many others dominated the field. But perhaps no performance was more important than that of Jackie Robinson, whose entrance into the game broke the color barrier, won him the respect of millions of Americans, and helped set the stage for the civil rights movement. Baseball's Pivotal Era, 1945-1951 also records the attempt to organize the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Mexican League's success in luring players south of the border that led to a series of lawsuits that almost undermined baseball's reserve clause and antitrust exemption. The result was spring training pay, uniform contracts, minimum salary levels, player representation, and a pension plan--the very issues that would divide players and owners almost fifty years later. During these years, the game was led by A.B. \"Happy\" Chandler, a hand-shaking, speech-making, singing Kentucky politician.

Many locals are surprised to discover that such renowned ballplayers as Pie Traynor, Hack Wilson, Eddie Stanky, and Harry \"The Cat\" Breechen got their start in Portsmouth. In 1933, Negro League legend Buck Leonard first played for the Portsmouth Revels and later returned to briefly star with the 1953 Merrimacs, his only opportunity to play integrated ball during his storied career. A number of former big-name players guided the team from the bench including Tony Lazzeri, Jimmie Foxx, and Pepper Martin to name a few.
