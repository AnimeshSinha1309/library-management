Press of Mississippi", "publishedDate": "2010-12-01", "description": "Sixty years before the comics entered the American newspaper press, Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer of Geneva (1799-1846), schoolmaster, university professor, polemical journalist, art critic, landscape draftsman, and writer of fiction, travel tales, and social criticism, invented a new art form: the comic strip, or \"picture story,\" that is now the graphic novel. At first he resisted publishing what he called his \"little follies.\" When he did, they became instantly popular, plagiarized, and imitated throughout Europe and the United States. T\u00f6pffer developed a graphic style suited to his poor eyesight: the doodle, which he systematized and also theorized. The drawings, with their \"modernist\" spontaneous, flickering, broken lines, forming figures in mad hyperactivity, run above deft, ironic captions and propel narratives of surreal absurdity. The artist's maniacal protagonists mix social satire with myth. By the mid-nineteenth century, Messrs. Jabot, Festus, Cryptogame, and other members of the crazy family, comprising eight picture stories in all, were instant folk heroes. In a biographical framework, Kunzle situates the comic strips in the Genevan and European culture of the time as well as in relation to T\u00f6pffer's other work, notably his hilarious travel tales, and recounts their curious genesis (with an initial imprimatur from Goethe, no less) and their controversial success. Kunzle's study, the first in English on the writer-artist, accompanies Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer: The Complete Comic Strips, a facsimile edition of the strips themselves, with the first-ever translation of these into English. David Kunzle is a professor of art history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of many books on popular culture and graphic arts, including History of the Comic Strip: The Nineteenth Century.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781604739985"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1604739983"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 207, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4-IaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4-IaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4-IaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4-IaBwAAQBAJ&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Father_of_the_Comic_Strip.html?hl=&id=4-IaBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4-IaBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Fortunately he was afflicted with poor eyesight at an early age, which led him to <br>\nevolve a manner of sketching as quick as thought and quick with ideas, so that he <br>\nmutated almost unconsciously into pictorial storytelling: the narrative <b>comic strip</b>."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "p6vaDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "VgPZbDIhbN8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/p6vaDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How to Write Comic Strips", "subtitle": "A Quick Guide on Writing Funny Gags and Comic Strip Panels", "authors": ["HowExpert", "John Zakour"], "publisher": "HowExpert", "publishedDate": "2017-10-16", "description": "\u201cHow to Write Comic Strips\u201d is a step-by-step guide to help inspiring comic strip writers create their own comic.

He is one much deserving, at last, of this first account of his huge oeuvre as a caricaturist. This book concentrates on his mastery of the important newcomer to the field of caricature, which we call comic strip, picture story, and graphic novel. The volume features facsimiles of nearly twenty of these from 1839 to 1863 and ranging from one page to forty (this last a parody of Victor Hugo's Les Mis\u00e9rables). In addition, summaries and sample illustrations of twenty-seven \"minor works\" demonstrate that Cham is by far the most important specialist of what was then a new genre in Europe. Born to an ancient aristocratic family, Cham was from early on wholly dedicated to an art considered far beneath his class. Starting as a disciple of the father of the modern comic strip, Swiss Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer, Cham soon launched out on his own, evolving an original form of comedy, his own com\u00e9die humaine, farcical, absurd, and parodic. His productivity was legendary and comprised all the known genres of caricature, the full-page cartoon lithograph, the thematic seasonal group, weekly and monthly humorous comment (much like the daily newspaper cartoonist today), and a feature called the Revue Comique, which made him the supreme graphic journalist of his day. Hitherto unknown correspondence reveals an attractive personality who was fond of animals and who honored a low-class woman he eventually made his countess. Vaunted comics scholar David Kunzle has created a fitting tribute to Cham's impact and genius.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781496816214"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1496816218"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 538, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rciBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rciBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rciBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rciBDwAAQBAJ&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Cham.html?hl=&id=rciBDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rciBDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book concentrates on his mastery of the important newcomer to the field of caricature, which we call comic strip, picture story, and graphic novel."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vCugDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "fKS2+EYi0u0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vCugDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Kid Comic Strips", "subtitle": "A Genre Across Four Countries", "authors": ["Ian Gordon"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2016-11-30", "description": "This book looks at the humor that artists and editors believed would have appeal in four different countries.

Little Nemo is the main fictional character in a series of weekly comic strips by Winsor McCay that appeared in the New York Herald and William Randolph Hearst's New York American newspapers respectively from October 15, 1905 \u2013 July 23, 1911 and September 3, 1911 \u2013 July 26, 1914. The strip was first called \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" and then \"In the Land of Wonderful Dreams\" when it changed papers in 1911. Although a comic strip, Little Nemo is far from a simple children's fantasy; it is often dark, surreal, threatening, and even violent. The original set-up of the comic revolved around the nightly dreams of a little boy named Nemo (meaning \"nobody\" in Latin). The purpose of his early dreams was to reach 'Slumberland', the realm of King Morpheus, who wanted him as a playmate for his daughter, Princess Camille. The last panel in each strip was always one of Nemo waking up, usually in or near his bed, and often being scolded (or comforted) by one of the grownups of the household after crying out in his sleep and waking them. In the earliest strips, the dream event that woke him up would always be some mishap or disaster that seemed about to lead to serious injury or death, such as being crushed by giant mushrooms, being turned into a monkey, falling from a bridge being held up by slaves, or gaining 90 years in age. Later on, when Nemo finally did reach Slumberland, he was constantly being woken up by Flip, a character who originally wore a hat that had 'Wake Up' written on it.

Press of Mississippi", "publishedDate": "2015-07-02", "description": "Among the masters of the nineteenth-century comic strip, Gustave Dor\u00e9 has been much neglected. For his illustrations to literary classics, he earned an unsurpassed reputation and corresponding scholarly attention. Dor\u00e9 himself repudiated his early work, and similarly critics and biographers have given short shrift to his beginnings as a caricaturist. These caricatures are herein rescued entirely for the first time in English by the renowned comics scholar David Kunzle. Dor\u00e9's caricature is known to a few specialists, but virtually no one has pointed out that his mastery of the comic strip particularly marks him as an entirely original figure in the post-T\u00f6pffer era of revolutionary, mid-century France. Dor\u00e9, remarkably, created these comic strips when he was between fifteen and twenty-two years old, for Charles Philipon's Journal pour Rire (The Laughter Journal), virtually dominating its seven-year (1848-55) history. He also did three fairly long, separately published albums, which show him at his very best. They are consistently funny, often ludicrous, and illustrate a graphic inventiveness unmatched until the twentieth century. In these graphic stories, Dor\u00e9 parodies an ancient fable, the discomforts of life in the country, the perils of artistic ambition, the absurdities of mountaineering and travel, as well as the antics of schoolboys. This book provides a context for Dor\u00e9's caricatures, focusing on his comic strips in the Journal pour Rire, the character of the journal, and the three comic strip albums he created while he worked there. Kunzle's analysis reveals Dor\u00e9's debts to his predecessors, T\u00f6pffer, Cham, and Nadar. None of Dor\u00e9's Journal strips has ever been republished. Some of the albums were republished, reduced and incomplete, in German and French. This edition includes facsimiles of the twelve most significant comic strips and the first translation into English of the captions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781626745896"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1626745897"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D9VTCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D9VTCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=D9VTCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D9VTCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D9VTCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2642.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2268.12, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D9VTCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-D9VTCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2642300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2268120000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=D9VTCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Some of the albums were republished, reduced and incomplete, in German and French.

It moves beyond the issue of defining the emblematic genre to examine the ways in which emblems - and their modern counterparts - interact with the surrounding culture, and what they disclose about that culture. Drawing largely on primary material from the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France and from Glasgow University Library's Stirling Maxwell Collection of emblem literature, Laurence Grove builds on the ideas of Marshall McLuhan, Elizabeth Eisenstein and, more recently, Neil Rhodes and Jonathan Sawday. Divided into four sections-Theoretics, Production, Thematics and Reception-Text/Image Mosaics in French Culture broaches topics such as theoretical approaches (past and present) to text/image forms, the question of narrative within the scope of text/image creations, and the reuse of visual iconography for diametrically opposed political or religious purposes. The author argues that, despite the gap in time between the advent of emblems and that of comic strips, the two forms are analogous, in that both are the products of a 'parallel mentality'. The mindsets of the periods that popularised these forms have certain common features related to repeated social conditions rather than to the pure evolution over time. Grove's analysis and historical contextualisation of that mentality provide insight into our own popular culture forms, not only the comic strip but also other hybrid media such as advertising and the Internet. His juxtaposition of emblems and the bande dessin\u00e9e increases our understanding of all such combinations of picture and text.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781351895637"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "135189563X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XUtBDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Text_Image_Mosaics_in_French_Culture-sample-epub.acsm?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Text_Image_Mosaics_in_French_Culture-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XUtBDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Divided into four sections-Theoretics, Production, Thematics and Reception-Text/Image Mosaics in French Culture broaches topics such as theoretical approaches (past and present) to text/image forms, the question of narrative within the ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kan9jwEACAAJ", "etag": "bXlUHRXSXDM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kan9jwEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "In the Land of Wonderful Dreams", "subtitle": "118 Full-Page Weekly Comic Strips (September 3, 1911 - July 26, 1914)", "authors": ["Winsor McCay"], "publisher": "Createspace Independent Publishing Platform", "publishedDate": "2016-03-14", "description": "Little Nemo is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Winsor McCay. Nemo was originally the protagonist of the comic strip Little Nemo in Slumberland. The full-page weekly comic strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel. The strip is considered McCay's masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail. Little Nemo in Slumberland ran in the New York Herald from October 15, 1905, until July 23, 1911 for a total of 302 full-page weekly comic strips; the strip was renamed In the Land of Wonderful Dreams when McCay brought it to William Randolph Hearst's New York American, where it ran from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914 for other 118 full-page weekly comic strips including one that was published on the Los Angeles Examiner. When McCay returned to the Herald in 1924, he revived the strip, and it ran under its original title from Aug 3, 1924, until December 26, 1926, when McCay returned to Hearst. This book contains the complete full color reprints of the New York American 118 full-page weekly comic strips, from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914, including one that was published on the Los Angeles Examiner.

Arab Comic Strips provides at least one indicator that this trend has begun to change. The study reflects the influence of both political economy and post-modernism. The former's influence can be seen in the authors' focus on mass culture and \"history from below,\" while the latter's manifests itself in the authors' use of semiotics and their eschewal of any linear model of social change or totalizing discourse. The strengths of Arab Comic Strips lie in its comprehensive treatment of the genre it scrutinizes. The authors present extensively detailed studies of comic strips that range from Iraq and the Gulf to North Africa and France. Further, the strips they select cover a wide thematic and ideological terrain. Pan-Arabist, Islamist, hybrid Western-Arab, and radical leftist strips all receive in-depth analysis. Through this analysis, the reader gains great insight into political and cultural debates specific to particular regions of the Arab world. The juxtaposition of strips representing different thematic, ideological, and geographical perspectives constitutes comparative analysis at its best. -- From http://www.jstor.org (Dec. 4, 2013).", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015008948989"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 263, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Comics & Graphic Novels"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "comicsContent": true, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fjhlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fjhlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fjhlAAAAMAAJ&q=Comic+Strips&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&cd=45&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fjhlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Arab_Comic_Strips.html?hl=&id=fjhlAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fjhlAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "54lszQEACAAJ", "etag": "vmmuhMJLC2Q", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/54lszQEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Blank Comic Book for Kids", "subtitle": "Make Your Own Comics | Large Comic Strips 8. 5 X 11 | 29 Different Layouts | Oldschool | Create Your Own Comics with This Comic Book Journal Notebook and Sketchbook for Kids and Adults .", "authors": ["Happy Kids"], "publishedDate": "2020-01-06", "description": "Blank Comic Book For Kids : Perfect comic book fun gift for birthdays, holiday gifts, or stocking stuffer for kids and adults!

When discovering the tapestry for the first time, visitors simply marvel at the great diversity of characters, clothes, buildings, ships and other features it portrays, literally losing themselves in what could be considered as the world's very first comic strip, dating from the Middle Ages. Comic strips have, of course, moved on with their balloons, onomatopoeia and a number of specific terms used in this 8th art, such as: foreground, angle shot, framing, dialogues... very much the same words as those used in cinema. Gilles Pivard and Arthur Shelton are delighted to present a compilation of this great fresco in a somewhat more contemporary comic strip style. However, to ensure that the work's authenticity remains intact, neither its illustrations nor its historical contents have been altered.

Excerpt: Dan Dare is a British science fiction comic hero, created by illustrator Frank Hampson who also wrote the first stories, that is, the Venus and Red Moon stories, and a complete storyline for Operation Saturn. Dare appeared in the Eagle comic story Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future in 1950, dramatised seven times a week on Radio Luxembourg. The stories were set in the late 1990s but the dialogue and manner of the characters is reminiscent of British war films of the 1950s. Dan Dare has been described as \"Biggles in Space\" and as the British equivalent of Buck Rogers. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated comic-strip artwork by Hampson and other artists, including Harold Johns, Don Harley, Bruce Cornwell, Greta Tomlinson, Frank Bellamy and Keith Watson. The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by Virgin Comics. It was written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Gary Erskine and is a completely new and somewhat darker interpretation of Dan Dare. Since October 2003, however, Dare's adventures have also continued in Spaceship Away, a specialist magazine created by Rod Barzilay by agreement with the Dan Dare Corporation. Published three times a year, its mission statement is basically to continue the original Dare's adventures where the original Eagle left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible.

That was several years ago, and she has been my main interest ever since.\" Bibliographical Note: This is a republication of \"Mopsy\" by Gladys Parker originally published by St. John Publishing Co., 1948.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1725523906"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781725523906"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 40, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A-jeugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A-jeugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A-jeugEACAAJ&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&cd=53&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A-jeugEACAAJ&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Mopsy.html?hl=&id=A-jeugEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=A-jeugEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "That was several years ago, and she has been my main interest ever since.&quot; Bibliographical Note: This is a republication of &quot;Mopsy&quot; by Gladys Parker originally published by St. John Publishing Co., 1948."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "klPYAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "w3XRcIA39BQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/klPYAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Comics Come Alive", "subtitle": "A Guide to Comic-strip Characters in Live-action Productions", "authors": ["Roy Kinnard"], "publishedDate": "1991", "description": "A comprehensive history of the various theatrical films and television shows adapted from the plethora of comic strips and comic books Americans have loved for most of the century_from Archie, Barbarella, Batman, and Blondie, to The Vigilante and Wonder Woman, and everyone in between, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Exploring mainstream companies such as Marvel and DC as well as rising stars from other segments of the industry, Frederick Aldama provides a new reading of race, ethnicity, and the relatively new storytelling medium of comics themselves. Overview chapters cover the evolution of Latino influences in comics, innovations, and representations of women, demonstrating Latino transcendence of many mainstream techniques. The author then probes the rich and complex ways in which such artists affect the cognitive and emotional responses of readers as they imagine past, present, and future worlds. Twenty-one interviews with Latino comic book and comic strip authors and artists, including Laura Molina, Frank Espinosa, and Rafael Navarro, complete the study, yielding captivating commentary on the current state of the trade, cultural perceptions, and the intentions of creative individuals who shape their readers in powerful ways.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0292749910"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780292749917"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 341, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&pg=PT81&dq=Comic+Strips&hl=&cd=82&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BaIP7O8u15UC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2578.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2264.34, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&rdid=book-BaIP7O8u15UC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2578460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2264340000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BaIP7O8u15UC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Strips with New Stripes 13 Just as one might choose to tell a story in the form of a <br>\nnovel, a film, a comic book, and so on, one might also choose that of the <b>comic</b> <br>\n<b>strip</b>.

Despite this fundamental part of human identity, little work has explored the comprehension and cognitive underpinnings of visual narratives-until now. This work presents a provocative theory: that drawings and sequential images are structured the same as language. Building on contemporary theories from linguistics and cognitive psychology, it argues that comics are written in a visual language of sequential images that combines with text. Like spoken and signed languages, visual narratives use a lexicon of systematic patterns stored in memory, strategies for combining these patterns into meaningful units, and a hierarchic grammar governing the combination of sequential images into coherent expressions. Filled with examples and illustrations, this book details each of these levels of structure, explains how cross-cultural differences arise in diverse visual languages of the world, and describes what the newest neuroscience research reveals about the brain's comprehension of visual narratives. From this emerges the foundation for a new line of research within the linguistic and cognitive sciences, raising intriguing questions about the connections between language and the diversity of humans' expressive behaviours in the mind and brain.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781441174512"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1441174516"}], "readingModes":
