It presents the drawbacks of building in situ (on-site) and demonstrates why prefabrication is the smarter choice for better integration of products and processes, more efficient delivery, and realizing more value in project life cycles. In addition, Prefab Architecture provides: A selected history of prefabrication from the Industrial Revolution to current computer numerical control, and a theory of production from integrated processes to lean manufacturing Coverage on the tradeoffs of off-site fabrication including scope, schedule, and cost with the associated principles of labor, risk, and quality Up-to-date products featuring examples of prefabricated structure, enclosure, service, and nterior building systems Documentation on the constraints and execution of manufacturing, factory production, transportation, and assembly Dozens of recent examples of prefab projects by contemporary architects and fabricators including KieranTimberlake, SHoP Architects, Office dA, Michelle Kaufmann, and many others In Prefab Architecture, the fresh approaches toward creating buildings that accurately convey ature and expanded green building methodologies make this book an important voice for adopting change in a construction industry entrenched in traditions of the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0470880465"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780470880463"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZOL4TKggo8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7835.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7835.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&rdid=book-NZOL4TKggo8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7835200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7835200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Prefab_Architecture-sample-epub.acsm?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Prefab_Architecture-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "uWttAAAAQBAJ", "etag": "ATbBEsO+sa0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/uWttAAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Architecture in Motion", "subtitle": "The history and development of portable building", "authors": ["Robert Kronenburg"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2013-08-15", "description": "The idea that architecture can be portable is one that grabs the imagination of both designers and the people who use it, perhaps because it so often forecasts a dynamic and creative solution to the complex problems of our contemporary mobile society, while at the same time dealing with issues of practicality, economy and sustainability. Architecture in Motion examines the development of portable, transportable, demountable and temporary architecture from prehistory to the present day. From familiar vernacular models such as the tent, mobile home and houseboat, to ambitious developments in military and construction engineering, all aspects of portable building are considered. Building on his earlier works Portable Architecture and Houses in Motion, Robert Kronenburg compares traditional forms of building, current commercial products and the work of innovative designers, and examines key contemporary portable buildings to reveal surprising, exciting and imaginative examples. He explores the philosophical and technological issues raised by these experimental and futuristic prototypes. By understanding the nature of transitory architecture, a new ecologically aware design strategy can be developed to prioritise buildings that 'tread lightly on the earth' and still convey the sense of identity and community necessary for an established responsible society.

But, driven in part by environmental concerns, landscape has recently emerged as a model and medium for the city, with some theorists arguing that landscape architects are the urbanists of our age. In Landscape as Urbanism, one of the field's pioneers presents a powerful case for rethinking the city through landscape. Charles Waldheim traces the roots of landscape as a form of urbanism from its origins in the Renaissance through the twentieth century. Growing out of progressive architectural culture and populist environmentalism, the concept was further informed by the nineteenth-century invention of landscape architecture as a \"new art\" charged with reconciling the design of the industrial city with its ecological and social conditions. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, as urban planning shifted from design to social science, and as urban design committed to neotraditional models of town planning, landscape urbanism emerged to fill a void at the heart of the contemporary urban project. Generously illustrated, Landscape as Urbanism examines works from around the world by designers ranging from Ludwig Hilberseimer, Andrea Branzi, and Frank Lloyd Wright to James Corner, Adriaan Geuze, and Michael Van Valkenburgh. The result is the definitive account of an emerging field that is likely to influence the design of cities for decades to come.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780691167909"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0691167907"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Landscape_as_Urbanism.html?hl=&id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ciywCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "DGrEHYMLfTs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ciywCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Global History of Architecture", "authors": ["Francis D.

Tomlan"], "publisher": "University of Georgia Press", "publishedDate": "2013-11-15", "description": "Today hop growing remains a viable commercial enterprise only in parts of the far western United States--notably in Washington. But, as James Fenimore Cooper remembered, the mid-nineteenth century in Cooperstown, New York, was a time when \"the 'hop was king,' and the whole countryside was one great hop yard, and beautiful\". In Tinged with Gold, Michael A. TomIan explores all aspects of hop culture in the United States and provides a background for understanding the buildings devoted to drying, baling, and storing hops. The work considers the history of these structures as it illustrates their development over almost two centuries, the result of agrarian commercialism and nearly continuous technological improvement. In examining the context in which the buildings were constructed, Tomlan considers the growth, cultivation, and harvesting of the plant; the economic, social, and recreational activities of the people involved in hop culture; and the record of mechanical inventions and technical developments that shaped hop kilns, hop houses, and hop driers and coolers in the various areas where the crop flourished. The work challenges assumptions about the noncommercial nature of American agriculture in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and raises important questions about the \"folk\" tradition of hop houses, arguing that the designs of these buildings were rational responses to commercial imperatives rather than the continuance of arcane English or European customs. Tinged with Gold brings hop culture to life as it explores the history of this neglected aspect of rural agriculture. Because the work demonstrates that the significance of a relatively obscure building type can be fully appreciated if placed in its historical context, it provides a model for studying other rural structures. Drawing upon an impressive array of primary and secondary sources, this work is a definitive history of hop culture in the United States.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780820347080"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0820347086"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lNfdCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lNfdCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lNfdCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lNfdCgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Tinged_with_Gold.html?hl=&id=lNfdCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Tinged_with_Gold-sample-pdf.acsm?id=lNfdCgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lNfdCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0CtBBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "rQAM8ApB6w8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0CtBBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Interpreting Engineering Drawings", "authors": ["Ted Branoff"], "publisher": "Cengage Learning", "publishedDate": "2015-01-01", "description": "INTERPRETING ENGINEERING DRAWINGS, 8th EDITION offers comprehensive, state-of-the-art training that shows readers how to create professional-quality engineering drawings that can be interpreted with precision in today's technology-based industries.

It thus occupies a key position in the long and fertile tradition of medieval beast-literature, but it also claims attention as a masterpiece in its own right, the work of one of the most daring and original satirists of the Middle Ages. Despite its importance, the \"Ysengrimus\" has been comparatively neglected because of its linguistic difficulties. Jill Mann eases these difficulties by presenting an English translation alongside the Latin text, and accompanying it with a detailed commentary. A full- length introduction offers an original account of the poem which shows how literary structure and historical dimensions are fused into an original satiric vision of compelling power. This book will not only interest medieval Latin specialists, but will make this major text accessible to those working on the related vernacular traditions. Its analysis of the poem's allusions to contemporary persons and events will also be of considerable interest to historians of twelfth-century Flanders.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9004081038"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789004081031"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 568, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Ysengrimus.html?hl=&id=cfi6BDAO3XQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "I_6h9FNZ_bsC", "etag": "+SeJFUtfZdo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/I_6h9FNZ_bsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Designs on Modernity", "subtitle": "Exhibiting the City in 1920s Paris", "authors": ["Tag Gronberg"], "publisher": "Manchester University Press", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "Designs on Modernity presents the 1925 Paris Exhibition as a key moment in attempts to update the image of Paris as \"capital of the 19th century.\" At the Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes, Paris itself, as much as the commodity, was put on show.

Commodus\u2019s passion for hunting animals was so fervent that he dreamt of shooting a tiger, an elephant, and a hippopotamus; his prowess was such that people claimed he never missed when hurling his javelin or firing arrows from his bow. For fourteen days near the end of AD 192, the emperor mounted one of the most lavish and spectacular gladiatorial games Rome had ever seen. Commodus himself was the star attraction, and people rushed from all over Italy to witness the spectacle. But this slaughter was simply the warm-up act to the main event: the emperor was also planning to fight as a gladiator. Why did Roman rulers spend vast resources on such over-the-top displays\u2014and why did some emperors appear in them as combatants? Why did the Roman rabble enjoy watching the slaughter of animals and the sight of men fighting to the death? And how best can we in the modern world understand what was truly at stake in the circus and the arena? In The Day Commodus Killed a Rhino, Jerry Toner set out to answer these questions by vividly describing what it would have been like to attend Commodus\u2019 fantastic shows and watch one of his many appearances as both hunter and fighter. Highlighting the massive logistical effort needed to supply the games with animals, performers, and criminals for execution, the book reveals how blood and gore were actually incidental to what really mattered. Gladiatorial games played a key role in establishing a forum for political debate between the rulers and the ruled. Roman crowds were not passive: they were made up of sophisticated consumers with their own political aims, which they used the games to secure. In addition, the games also served as a pure expression of what it meant to be a true Roman. Drawing on notions of personal honor, manly vigor, and sophisticated craftsmanship, the games were a story that the Romans loved to tell themselves about themselves.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781421415864"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1421415860"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Day_Commodus_Killed_a_Rhino.html?hl=&id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "D7M_pWDC3wYC", "etag": "glU9Ip4vWzk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/D7M_pWDC3wYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Classical Architecture", "subtitle": "The Poetics of Order", "authors": ["Alexander Tzonis", "Liane Lefaivre"], "publisher": "MIT Press", "publishedDate": "1986", "description": "This fascinating introduction to classical art and architecture is the first book to investigate the way classical buildings are put together as formal structures.

The 205 line drawings make up a discourse of their own, a pictorial text that serves as an introductory theory of composition or basic design aid. Drawing from Vitruvius, the poetics of Aristotle, the theories of classical architecture, music, and poetry since the Renaissance, and the poetics of the Russian formalists, the authors present classical architecture as a coherent system of architectural thinking that is capable of producing a tragic humanistic discourse, a public art with critical, moral, and philosophical meaning.

Where smart city strategies promote the roll-out of internet of things (IoT) technologies and big data analytics by city governments worldwide, platform urbanism responds to the deep and pervasive entanglements that exist between urban citizens, city services and platform ecosystems today. Recent years have witnessed a backlash against major global platforms, evidenced by burgeoning literatures on platform capitalism, the platform society, platform surveillance and platform governance, as well as regulatory attention towards the market power of platforms in their dominance of global data infrastructure. This book responds to these developments and asks: How do platform ecosystems reshape connected cities?

Author Edith Cherry vividly demonstrates in this inspiring tutorial that the programming process not only helps architects avoid the endless design revisions occurring in most projects, but that it is also the key to designing for optimal form and function. Programming for Design lets you rapidly acquire the knowledge and skills needed to successfully program a moderate-size space. Rather than simply describe basic principles and practices, this straightforward guide helps you master architectural programming by actually doing it. Professor Cherry identifies the central issues involved and describes the skills needed to work with clients to identify problems to be solved by a design effort. Emphasizing designing for people, she offers proven strategies and techniques for goal setting, information gathering and analysis, concept development, program synthesis, and communicating with clients. The book is also devoted to practical applications. The author walks you step-by-step through a project of your own choosing, providing numerous examples and four case studies within each step that vividly illustrate how to effectively gather, process, and communicate information. Programming for Design features more than 200 supporting illustrations, diagrams, and sidebars appearing throughout the text, reproducing pithy sayings by such far-flung figures as Plato and Yogi Berra, Einstein and Lao Tzu, that help relate the programming process to other disciplines.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0471196452"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780471196457"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=plSy0Uv9FTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=plSy0Uv9FTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=plSy0Uv9FTMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=plSy0Uv9FTMC&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Programming_for_Design.html?hl=&id=plSy0Uv9FTMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=plSy0Uv9FTMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Z8RxKVJjc1MC", "etag": "0L7wxmAsTOo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Z8RxKVJjc1MC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The True, the Fictive, and the Real", "subtitle": "The Historical Dictionary of Architecture of Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy", "authors": ["Samir Youn\u00e9s"], "publisher": "Papadakis Publisher", "publishedDate": "1999", "description": "The importance of this dictionary stems from Quatreme're's profound reflections on the nature of architecture: on the principles which are at the source of his rules and on the roles of imitation and invention within tradition.

Architecture of the Everyday makes a plea for an architecture that is emphatically un-monumental, anti-heroic, and unconcerned with formal extravagance. Edited by Deborah Berke and Steven Harris, this collection of writings, photo-essays, and projects describes an architecture that draws strength from its simplicity, use of common materials, and relationship to other fields of study.

Historian Nicholas Papayanis examines the emergence and evolution of modern urban planning in Paris between the end of the eighteenth and the middle of the nineteenth century, focusing on the principles and concerns that informed competing plans for the city. Papayanis examines three major planning traditions in this period: functionalist, Saint-Simonian, and Fourierist. The latter two drew their inspiration from the utopian-socialist philosophers, while the former comprised practical proposals by civil engineers and administrators. Regardless of their perspective, the thinkers within each tradition critiqued the disorder, inefficiency, and social misery of Paris as it was, imagining a new city that balanced commerce, public health and safety, circulation, and social order. Ultimately, Papayanis finds, this vision of the modern industrial and commercial city lent itself to the creation of a hegemonic order that suited the demands of the state, capitalism, and the middle-class urbanite, often at the expense of other interests. Planning Paris before Haussmann uncovers the intellectual ferment about city planning and urban reform that constituted a powerful intellectual and theoretical foundation for Haussmannization and for modern urban planning.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801879302"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801879302"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=umLmjHFZoT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=umLmjHFZoT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=umLmjHFZoT4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=umLmjHFZoT4C&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Planning_Paris_Before_Haussmann.html?hl=&id=umLmjHFZoT4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Planning_Paris_Before_Haussmann-sample-epub.acsm?id=umLmjHFZoT4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=umLmjHFZoT4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tdM9Hn7pzrsC", "etag": "vTV2Ex79RJY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tdM9Hn7pzrsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Arcades Project", "authors": ["Walter Benjamin"], "publisher": "Harvard University Press", "publishedDate": "1999", "description": "Critiquing the arcades of nineteenth-century Paris--glass-roofed rows of shops that served as early malls--the author, who wrote the work in the 1920s and 1930s, covers thirty-six still-trenchant topics, including fashion, boredom, photography, advertising, and prostitution, among others.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "067404326X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780674043268"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 1073, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tdM9Hn7pzrsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tdM9Hn7pzrsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tdM9Hn7pzrsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tdM9Hn7pzrsC&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Arcades_Project.html?hl=&id=tdM9Hn7pzrsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tdM9Hn7pzrsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "iNg7DQAAQBAJ", "etag": "9DjOO2BgqSY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iNg7DQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Building Acoustics and Vibration", "subtitle": "Theory and Practice", "authors": ["Osama A B Hassan"], "publisher": "World Scientific Publishing Company", "publishedDate": "2009-06-24", "description": "As a comprehensive reference dedicated to sound and vibration in buildings, Building Acoustics and Vibration addresses the basic and advanced principles that can be used to solve practical and theoretical problems typically encountered in building and architectural acoustic practices.

One day in the early 1950s, Walt Disney stood looking over 240 acres of farmland in Anaheim, California, and imagined building a park where people \u201ccould live among Mickey Mouse and Snow White in a world still powered by steam and fire for a day or a week or (if the visitor is slightly mad) forever.\u201d Despite his wealth and fame, exactly no one wanted Disney to build such a park. Not his brother Roy, who ran the company\u2019s finances; not the bankers; and not his wife, Lillian. Amusement parks at that time, such as Coney Island, were a generally despised business, sagging and sordid remnants of bygone days. Disney was told that he would only be heading toward financial ruin. But Walt persevered, initially financing the park against his own life insurance policy and later with sponsorship from ABC and the sale of thousands and thousands of Davy Crockett coonskin caps. Disney assembled a talented team of engineers, architects, artists, animators, landscapers, and even a retired admiral to transform his ideas into a soaring yet soothing wonderland of a park. The catch was that they had only a year and a day in which to build it. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland opened its gates\u2026and the first day was a disaster. Disney was nearly suicidal with grief that he had failed on a grand scale. But the curious masses kept coming, and the rest is entertainment history. Eight hundred million visitors have flocked to the park since then. In Disney\u2019s Land, Richard Snow brilliantly presents the entire spectacular story, a wild ride from vision to realization, and an epic of innovation and error that reflects the uniqueness of the man determined to build \u201cthe happiest place on earth\u201d with a watchmaker\u2019s precision, an artist\u2019s conviction, and the desperate, high-hearted recklessness of a riverboat gambler.",

and Real Space", "authors": ["Elizabeth Grosz"], "publisher": "MIT Press", "publishedDate": "2001-06-22", "description": "Essays at the intersection of philosophy and architecture explore how we understand and inhabit space. To be outside allows one a fresh perspective on the inside. In these essays, philosopher Elizabeth Grosz explores the ways in which two disciplines that are fundamentally outside each another\u2014architecture and philosophy\u2014can meet in a third space to interact free of their internal constraints. \"Outside\" also refers to those whose voices are not usually heard in architectural discourse but who inhabit its space\u2014the destitute, the homeless, the sick, and the dying, as well as women and minorities. Grosz asks how we can understand space differently in order to structure and inhabit our living arrangements accordingly. Two themes run throughout the book: temporal flow and sexual specificity. Grosz argues that time, change, and emergence, traditionally viewed as outside the concerns of space, must become more integral to the processes of design and construction. She also argues against architecture's historical indifference to sexual specificity, asking what the existence of (at least) two sexes has to do with how we understand and experience space. Drawing on the work of such philosophers as Henri Bergson, Roger Caillois, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Luce Irigaray, and Jacques Lacan, Grosz raises abstract but nonformalistic questions about space, inhabitation, and building. All of the essays propose philosophical experiments to render space and building more mobile and dynamic.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262265362"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262265362"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 248, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.0.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3JEhQLYnbWAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3JEhQLYnbWAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3JEhQLYnbWAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3JEhQLYnbWAC&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Architecture_from_the_Outside.html?hl=&id=3JEhQLYnbWAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Architecture_from_the_Outside-sample-epub.acsm?id=3JEhQLYnbWAC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Architecture_from_the_Outside-sample-pdf.acsm?id=3JEhQLYnbWAC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3JEhQLYnbWAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "YDnN6cvTpHoC", "etag": "Dy3EK5ihDEE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YDnN6cvTpHoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Space and the Architect", "subtitle": "Lessons in Architecture 2", "authors": ["Herman Hertzberger"], "publisher": "010 Publishers", "publishedDate": "2000", "description": "This book complements 'Lessons for Students in Architecture' published in 1991.

Its hallmarks were brevity and exactitude, with disdain for \"non-functional\" ornamentation. This book shows that the language of scientists does remain language and that a skillful use of its rhetorical and poetic aspects often determines the \"facts\" and the transmission of information. The exceptional literary qualities of Darwin's The Origin of Species are taken as a point in case. The importance of language in science has ontological implications: science can no longer be considered an action performed by a speaking subject on a mute object. Does the creative role of language in science mean that human beings \"create\" the world? The author emphatically rejects a conclusion which would degrade nature to mere malleable material at the mercy of human beings. A hermeneutical model for the relationship between knower and known is suggested: creative interaction between reader and text. The reader's responses actualise a text's meaning; in like manner, scientists give their responses to reality by actualising one of many possibilities.

But what actually makes a good city? Why, really, are some cities a joy to live in? As writer and journalist Charles Montgomery reveals, it's not how much money your neighbours earn, or how spectacular the views from your windows are, or even how pleasant the climate is that makes the most difference. Journeying to dozens of cities - from Atlanta to Bogot\u00e1 to Vancouver - he talks to the new champions of the happy city to discover the progressive movements already transforming people's lives. He meets the visionary Colombian mayor who turned some of the world's most dangerous roads into an urban cycling haven; the Danish architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan towns to modern-day Copenhagen; the New York City transport commissioner who made out of the gridlock of Times Square a place where people could lounge in the sun; and the Californian mother with the super-commute who completely rethought her idea of the suburban dream for the sake of her son's health. These urban trailblazers, as well as the many other planners, engineers, grass-roots campaigners and ordinary citizens, offer a wealth of surprising lessons for the rest of us. From how saying hello to your neighbours is just as important to your sense of trust as contact with close friends and family, and how living close to parks makes us smarter, kinder and reduces local crime rates, to the importance of the 'magic triangle' rule, Happy City shows thatsimple changes can make all the difference.

a brain, but it could be a sustainable one.\" Lucy Siegle, Crafts Magazine Fully revised and updated, the second edition of Sustainable Fashion and Textiles: Design Journeys continues to define the field of design in fashion and textiles. Arranged in two sections, the first four chapters represent key stages of the lifecycle: material cultivation/extraction, production, use and disposal. The remaining four chapters explore design approaches for altering the scale and nature of consumption, including service design, localism, speed and user involvement. While each chapter is complete in and of itself, their real value comes from what they represent together: innovative ways of thinking about textiles and garments based on sustainability values and an interconnected approach to design.

And although popular and public discourses from speeches to films invite a shared sense of the past, official sites of memory such as memorials, museums, and battlefields embody unique rhetorical principles. Places of Public Memory: The Rhetoric of Museums and Memorials is a sustained and rigorous consideration of the intersections of memory, place, and rhetoric. From the mnemonic systems inscribed upon ancient architecture to the roadside accident memorials that line America\u2019s highways, memory and place have always been deeply interconnected. This book investigates the intersections of memory and place through nine original essays written by leading memory studies scholars from the fields of rhetoric, media studies, organizational communication, history, performance studies, and English. The essays address, among other subjects, the rhetorical strategies of those vying for competing visions of a 9/11 memorial at New York City\u2019s Ground Zero; rhetorics of resistance embedded in the plans for an expansion of the National Civil Rights Museum; representations of nuclear energy\u2014both as power source and weapon\u2014in Cold War and post\u2013Cold War museums; and tours and tourism as acts of performance.

Both the urban villa and the prototype demonstrate the characteristics of high level industrial production with an extremely low ecological footprint, as well as being energy-positive in use, and both are suitable for multi-storey housing. The research, development, production and built prototype resulted in a unique innovation on the Dutch building market: a sustainable energy-positive apartment system for medium-rise energy-positive housing. This scientific report deals with the history, development and realization process of the prototype up to the completion of the building phase, after which the prototype was furnished and the garden landscaped, culminating with the opening of the prototype in October 2012. The development was initiated by Mick Eekhout\u2019s Chair of Product Development at the TU Delft at the specific request of the building industry and was carried out in close collaboration with a consortium of partners from the SME building supply industry. Innovation continues to progress in these partner industries. The entire project was externally financed for the 8 years of its duration. Apart from initiative and natural project leadership, the innovative contribution of the Chair included the design, coordination and integration of the many components into the single coherent entity of the Concept House \u2018Delft\u2019 Prototype.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781614995524"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1614995524"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 212, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uMjXCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uMjXCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uMjXCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=76&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uMjXCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Development_and_Realisation_of_the_Conce.html?hl=&id=uMjXCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uMjXCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "n8V546i9zGAC", "etag": "K3BBiQfju14", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/n8V546i9zGAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Staircase", "subtitle": "Studies of Hazards, Falls, and Safer Design", "authors": ["John Templer"], "publisher": "MIT Press", "publishedDate": "1995-03", "description": "John Templer has written the first theoretical, historical, and scientific analysisof one of the most basic and universal building elements: the stair. Together, these two volumespresent a detailed study of stairs and ramps - the art and science of their design, their history,and their hazards.For the designer and the art and architectural historian, the first volume treatsthe fascinating history of stairs and their immense influence on the art and science ofarchitecture. It is illustrated with more than 100 photographs from around the world and reviews theliterature on stairs (as well as ladders and railings and ramps) from Vitruvius to Venturi. Templerconsiders the whole play of meanings in the idea of the stair - as art object, as structural idea,as legal prescription, or as poetic fancy - making it clear that the stair is simultaneously anaesthetic, architectonic, ergonomic, and cultural element.The second volume shows the dangers stairspresent. Drawing on twenty years of human factors research on stairs, Templer sets out what is knownabout slips, trips, and falls and how best to design stairs to avoid their inherent dangers. Hediscusses the physiological and behavioral relationship between humans and stairs and walkways, thequestion of gait and slippery surfaces, and the various types of falls and the injuries that result.Perhaps most importantly, Templer proposes the idea of the soft stair, which could substantiallyreduce the annual epidemic of stair-related deaths and injuries.John Templer is Regents' Professorof Architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Infrastructure Planning and Finance is designed for the local practitioner or student who wants to learn the basics of how to develop an infrastructure plan, a program, or an individual infrastructure project. A team of authors with experience in public works, planning, and city government explain the history and economic environment of infrastructure and capital planning, addressing common tools like the comprehensive plan, sustainability plans, and local regulations. The book guides readers through the preparation and development of comprehensive plans and infrastructure projects, and through major funding mechanisms, from bonds, user fees, and impact fees to privatization and competition. The rest of the book describes the individual infrastructure systems: their elements, current issues and a 'how-to-do-it' section that covers the system and the comprehensive plan, development regulations and how it can be financed. Innovations such as decentralization, green and blue-green technologies are described as well as local policy actions to achieve a more sustainable city are also addressed. Chapters include water, wastewater, solid waste, streets, transportation, airports, ports, community facilities, parks, schools, energy and telecommunications. Attention is given to how local policies can ensure a sustainable and climate friendly infrastructure system, and how planning for them can be integrated across disciplines.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135906481"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1135906483"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 738, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.5.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=84&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7845.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7845.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mRoKAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7845820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7845820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Infrastructure_Planning_and_Finance-sample-epub.acsm?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Infrastructure_Planning_and_Finance-sample-pdf.acsm?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mRoKAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "iFZ_KSJyksUC", "etag": "ktJlQRapfAg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iFZ_KSJyksUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Construction Methods and Planning", "authors": ["J.R.

What are the roles of public space in these movements? What are the implications of urban resistance for the remaking of public space in the \"age of shrinking democracy\"? To what extent do these resistances move from anti- to alter-politics? City Unsilenced brings together a cross-disciplinary group of scholars and scholar-activists to examine the spaces, conditions, and processes in which neoliberal practices have profoundly impacted the everyday social, economic, and political life of citizens and communities around the globe. They explore the commonalities and specificities of urban resistance movements that respond to those impacts. They focus on how such movements make use of and transform the meanings and capacity of public space. They investigate their ramifications in the continued practices of renewing democracies. A broad collection of cases is presented and analyzed, including Movimento Passe Livre (Brazil), Google Bus Blockades San Francisco (USA), the Platform for Mortgage Affected People (PAH) (Spain), the Piqueteros Movement (Argentina), Umbrella Movement (Hong Kong), post-Occupy Gezi Park (Turkey), Sunflower Movement (Taiwan), Occupy Oakland (USA), Syntagma Square (Greece), Researchers for Fair Policing (New York), Urban Movement Congress (Poland), urban activism (Berlin), 1DMX (Mexico), Miyashita Park Tokyo (Japan), 15M Movement (Spain), and Train of Hope and protests against Academic Ball in Vienna (Austria).

Will the process continue in the twenty-first century or has it ended? What does this mean for the people who live there? Can they do anything about it? This book challenges conventional wisdom, which holds gentrification to be the simple outcome of new middle-class tastes and a demand for urban living. It reveals gentrification as part of a much larger shift in the political economy and culture of the late twentieth century. Documenting in gritty detail the conflicts that gentrification brings to the new urban 'frontiers', the author explores the interconnections of urban policy, patterns of investment, eviction, and homelessness. The failure of liberal urban policy and the end of the 1980s financial boom have made the end-of-the-century city a darker and more dangerous place.

While the world struggles with a global housing crisis and the impact of accelerated automation on labour, digital designers\u2019 narrow focus on mere style and continuous differentiation seems increasingly out of touch. This issue charts an emerging body of work that is based on a computational understanding of the discrete part or building block \u2013 elements that are as scalable, accessible and versatile as digital data. The discrete proposes that a new, digital understanding of assembly, based on parts, contains the greatest promise for a complex, open-ended, adaptable architecture. This approach capitalises on the digital economy and automation, with the potential of the digital to democratise production and increase access. The digital not only has deep implications for how we design and produce architecture; it is first and foremost a new system of production with economic, social and political consequences that need to be taken into account. This issue presents a diverse body of work focused on the notion of the discrete: from design experiments and aesthetics, to urban models, tectonics, distributed robots, new material organisations and post-capitalist scenarios engaging with automation.

Through case studies ranging from the republican to imperial periods, it demonstrates how powerfully monuments shaped how Romans performed, experienced, and remembered triumphs and, consequently, how Romans conceived of an urban identity for their city. Monuments highlighted Roman conquests of foreign peoples, enabled Romans to envision future triumphs, made triumphs more memorable through emotional arousal of spectators, and even generated distorted memories of triumphs that might never have occurred. This book illustrates the far-reaching impact of the architecture of the triumph on how Romans thought about this ritual and, ultimately, their own place within the Mediterranean world. In doing so, it offers a new model for historicizing the interrelations between monuments, individual and shared memory, and collective identities.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781107103573"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1107103576"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 310, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KjueDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KjueDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KjueDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KjueDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Architecture_of_the_Roman_Triumph.html?hl=&id=KjueDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KjueDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "afiZn2h8QjEC", "etag": "OXDT6GNsg4M", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/afiZn2h8QjEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Tree Roots in the Built Environment", "authors": ["John Roberts", "Nick Jackson", "Mark Smith", "Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (Great Britain)"], "publisher": "The Stationery Office", "publishedDate": "2006-06-14", "description": "This publication sets out a comprehensive review of tree root biology and covers a broad range of practical issues that need to be considered in order to grow trees successfully in our towns and cities and to realise the significant benefits they provide in built environments.

Built by the Manchu prince Mianyu in the mid-nineteenth century, the garden was intended to serve as a refuge from the clutter of daily life near the Forbidden City. In 1860, during the Anglo-French war in China, the garden was destroyed. One hundred years later, in the 1960s, the garden served as the \"ox pens,\" where dissident university professors were imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. Peaceful Western involvement began in 1986, when ground was broken for the Arthur Sackler Museum of Art and Archaeology. Completed in 1993, the museum and the Jillian Sackler Sculpture Garden stand on the same grounds today. In Place and Memory in the Singing Crane Garden, Vera Schwarcz gives voice to this richly layered corner of China's cultural landscape. Drawing upon a range of sources from poetry to painting, Schwarcz retells the garden's complex history in her own poetic and personal voice.

The airport can handle 25 million passengers a year, By 2020, however, the airport will be able to handle 120 000 000 passengers a year. It is not surprising that everyone should wonder why Malaysia would need an international airport of that size. The reason is the intense strategic competition that has already started. Unquestionably, the world will have an entirely new high-speed transportation system by 2025 at the latest. This will be the HSST (Hypersonic Speed Transport), which will carry between 300 and 500 passengers at speeds up to Mach 3.5. The HSST will be meaningless for short routes. Therefore the required international hub airports will be limited to two in North America, one in Central and South America, one in Africa, two in Europe, one in Russia, and three in Asia. Like China and South Korea, Malaysia is very eager to obtain one of the three Asian international hub airports, because a country with such an airport and the associated infrastructure is very likely to become a financial, information, tourism and advanced industrial centre. The airport is an integral part of a future linear capital corridor, which was also developed by Kurokawa. The area surrounding the airport will be used for an experiment in artificially restoring the tropical rain forest. Creating such a forest is the most effective method for blocking out noise from the airport. This is the basis of the architect's concept for a symbiosis between airport and forest. In addition, the architect believes that this is effective for expressing the identity of Malaysia, as tropical rain forests are the typical vegetation of the country. Kurokawa was a key figure of Japanese Metabolism; he has played an essential role in this movement, not only through projects and buildings, but also through theoretical writings. Since then he has been one of the leading architects in Japan.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783930698240"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3930698242"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 47, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zSFeBxrVDqAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zSFeBxrVDqAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zSFeBxrVDqAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zSFeBxrVDqAC&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Kisho_Kurokawa.html?hl=&id=zSFeBxrVDqAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zSFeBxrVDqAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "eKYDDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "WGzAzANLQ0k", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eKYDDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "What Makes a Great City", "authors": ["Alexander Garvin"], "publisher": "Island Press", "publishedDate": "2016-09-08", "description": "One of Planetizen's Top Planning Books for 2017 - San Francisco Chronicle's 2016 Holiday Books Gift Guide Pick What makes a great city?

A great city is a dynamic, constantly changing place that residents and their leaders can reshape to satisfy their demands.

Can it return individuals to awhole, to a world, to a community? Developing Giedion\u00b9s claim that contemporary architecture's maintask is to interpret a way of life valid for our time, philosopher Karsten Harries answers thatarchitecture should serve a common ethos. But if architecture is to meet that task, it first has tofree itself from the dominant formalist approach, and get beyond the notion that its purpose is toproduce endless variations of the decorated shed.In a series of cogent and balanced arguments,Harries questions the premises on which architects and theorists have long relied -- premises whichhave contributed to architecture's current identity crisis and marginalization. He first criticizesthe aesthetic approach, focusing on the problems of decoration and ornament. He then turns to thelanguage of architecture. If the main task of architecture is indeed interpretation, in just whatsense can it be said to speak, and what should it be speaking about? Expanding upon suggestions madeby Martin Heidegger, Harries also considers the relationship of building to the idea and meaning ofdwelling.Architecture, Harries observes, has a responsibility to community; but its ethical functionis inevitably also political, He concludes by examining these seemingly paradoxicalfunctions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "026258171X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262581714"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 403, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1hCo61dbB6QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1hCo61dbB6QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1hCo61dbB6QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1hCo61dbB6QC&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ethical_Function_of_Architecture.html?hl=&id=1hCo61dbB6QC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1hCo61dbB6QC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y8bJDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "vMZMco0Iak4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y8bJDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Details for Passive Houses: Renovation", "subtitle": "A Catalogue of Ecologically Rated Constructions for Renovation", "authors": ["IBO \u00d6sterreichisches Institut f\u00fcr Baubiologie und -\u00f6kologie"], "publisher": "Birkh\u00e4user", "publishedDate": "2017-01-01", "description": "Ecological refurbishment to Passivhaus standard requires know-how and experience.
