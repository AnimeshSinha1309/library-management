It presents the drawbacks of building in situ (on-site) and demonstrates why prefabrication is the smarter choice for better integration of products and processes, more efficient delivery, and realizing more value in project life cycles. In addition, Prefab Architecture provides: A selected history of prefabrication from the Industrial Revolution to current computer numerical control, and a theory of production from integrated processes to lean manufacturing Coverage on the tradeoffs of off-site fabrication including scope, schedule, and cost with the associated principles of labor, risk, and quality Up-to-date products featuring examples of prefabricated structure, enclosure, service, and nterior building systems Documentation on the constraints and execution of manufacturing, factory production, transportation, and assembly Dozens of recent examples of prefab projects by contemporary architects and fabricators including KieranTimberlake, SHoP Architects, Office dA, Michelle Kaufmann, and many others In Prefab Architecture, the fresh approaches toward creating buildings that accurately convey ature and expanded green building methodologies make this book an important voice for adopting change in a construction industry entrenched in traditions of the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0470880465"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780470880463"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZOL4TKggo8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7835.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7835.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&rdid=book-NZOL4TKggo8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7835200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7835200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Prefab_Architecture-sample-epub.acsm?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Prefab_Architecture-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NZOL4TKggo8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "NhLyGME7734C", "etag": "xY9MVCG7ZkY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NhLyGME7734C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Grand Hotels", "subtitle": "Reality and Illusion", "authors": ["Elaine Denby"], "publisher": "Reaktion Books", "publishedDate": "2002", "description": "From its beginnings as the humble inn, the hotel has undergone enormous changes over the centuries.

These magnificent structures-known as stepwells or stepped ponds-are much more than utilitarian reservoirs. Their lattice-like walls, carved columns, decorated towers, and intricate sculpture make them exceptional architecture., while their very presence tells much about the region's ecology and history. For these past 500 years, stepwells have been an integral part of western Indian communities as sites for drinking, washing, and bathing, as well as for colorful festivals and sacred rituals. Steps to Water traces the fascinating history of stepwells, from their Hindu origins, to their zenith during Muslim rule, and eventual decline under British occupation. It also reflects on their current use, preservation, and place in Indian communities.

This volume introduces credible 'fresh thinking' on how this may be done. For the first time an emerging generation of research is brought together that is directly concerned with understanding, influencing and leading the transformation of markets and thinking in the built environment. Chapters cover: defining values setting targets consumer motivation selling existing ideas better developing new design principles, paradigms and programmes optimizing solutions to ensure that when change does happen, it does so in the right direction. Papers are contributed by leading experts in fields ranging from philosophy, the social, political and physical sciences, engineering, architecture, mathematics and complexity science.

But, driven in part by environmental concerns, landscape has recently emerged as a model and medium for the city, with some theorists arguing that landscape architects are the urbanists of our age. In Landscape as Urbanism, one of the field's pioneers presents a powerful case for rethinking the city through landscape. Charles Waldheim traces the roots of landscape as a form of urbanism from its origins in the Renaissance through the twentieth century. Growing out of progressive architectural culture and populist environmentalism, the concept was further informed by the nineteenth-century invention of landscape architecture as a \"new art\" charged with reconciling the design of the industrial city with its ecological and social conditions. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, as urban planning shifted from design to social science, and as urban design committed to neotraditional models of town planning, landscape urbanism emerged to fill a void at the heart of the contemporary urban project. Generously illustrated, Landscape as Urbanism examines works from around the world by designers ranging from Ludwig Hilberseimer, Andrea Branzi, and Frank Lloyd Wright to James Corner, Adriaan Geuze, and Michael Van Valkenburgh. The result is the definitive account of an emerging field that is likely to influence the design of cities for decades to come.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780691167909"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0691167907"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Landscape_as_Urbanism.html?hl=&id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=PW2YDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HL2I_t_ZyQoC", "etag": "xR+J6GUp7kw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HL2I_t_ZyQoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Global History of Architecture", "authors": ["Mark M.

Tomlan"], "publisher": "University of Georgia Press", "publishedDate": "2013-11-15", "description": "Today hop growing remains a viable commercial enterprise only in parts of the far western United States--notably in Washington. But, as James Fenimore Cooper remembered, the mid-nineteenth century in Cooperstown, New York, was a time when \"the 'hop was king,' and the whole countryside was one great hop yard, and beautiful\". In Tinged with Gold, Michael A. TomIan explores all aspects of hop culture in the United States and provides a background for understanding the buildings devoted to drying, baling, and storing hops. The work considers the history of these structures as it illustrates their development over almost two centuries, the result of agrarian commercialism and nearly continuous technological improvement. In examining the context in which the buildings were constructed, Tomlan considers the growth, cultivation, and harvesting of the plant; the economic, social, and recreational activities of the people involved in hop culture; and the record of mechanical inventions and technical developments that shaped hop kilns, hop houses, and hop driers and coolers in the various areas where the crop flourished. The work challenges assumptions about the noncommercial nature of American agriculture in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and raises important questions about the \"folk\" tradition of hop houses, arguing that the designs of these buildings were rational responses to commercial imperatives rather than the continuance of arcane English or European customs. Tinged with Gold brings hop culture to life as it explores the history of this neglected aspect of rural agriculture. Because the work demonstrates that the significance of a relatively obscure building type can be fully appreciated if placed in its historical context, it provides a model for studying other rural structures.

Despite its importance, the \"Ysengrimus\" has been comparatively neglected because of its linguistic difficulties. Jill Mann eases these difficulties by presenting an English translation alongside the Latin text, and accompanying it with a detailed commentary. A full- length introduction offers an original account of the poem which shows how literary structure and historical dimensions are fused into an original satiric vision of compelling power. This book will not only interest medieval Latin specialists, but will make this major text accessible to those working on the related vernacular traditions. Its analysis of the poem's allusions to contemporary persons and events will also be of considerable interest to historians of twelfth-century Flanders.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9004081038"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789004081031"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 568, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Ysengrimus.html?hl=&id=cfi6BDAO3XQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QpawDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Ind83bzAcX0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QpawDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lives of Houses", "authors": ["Hermione Lee", "Kate Kennedy"], "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "publishedDate": "2020-03-24", "description": "A group of notable writers\u2014including UK poet laureate Simon Armitage, Julian Barnes, Margaret MacMillan, and Jenny Uglow\u2014celebrate our fascination with the houses of famous literary figures, artists, composers, and politicians of the past What can a house tell us about the person who lives there? Do we shape the buildings we live in, or are we formed by the places we call home? And why are we especially fascinated by the houses of the famous and often long-dead? In Lives of Houses, a group of notable biographers, historians, critics, and poets explores these questions and more through fascinating essays on the houses of great writers, artists, composers, and politicians of the past. Editors Kate Kennedy and Hermione Lee are joined by wide-ranging contributors, including Simon Armitage, Julian Barnes, David Cannadine, Roy Foster, Alexandra Harris, Daisy Hay, Margaret MacMillan, Alexander Masters, and Jenny Uglow. We encounter W. H. Auden, living in joyful squalor in New York's St. Mark's Place, and W. B. Yeats in his flood-prone tower in the windswept West of Ireland. We meet Benjamin Disraeli, struggling to keep up appearances, and track the lost houses of Virginia Woolf and Elizabeth Bowen. We visit Benjamin Britten in Aldeburgh, England, and Jean Sibelius at Ainola, Finland. But Lives of Houses also considers those who are unhoused, unwilling or unable to establish a home\u2014from the bewildered poet John Clare wandering the byways of England to the exiled Zimbabwean writer Dambudzo Marechera living on the streets of London. With more than forty illustrations, Lives of Houses illuminates what houses mean to us and how we use them to connect to and think about the past.

She features detailsfrom real world projects in a variety of climates, successful andunsuccessful case studies, and checklists you can use on your ownprojects. Helps you reduce your liability by showing why buildingenvelopes fail and how they can be designed to endure. Moves from theory to actual construction by including hundredsof building envelope details from a broad array of projects andclimates. Integrates numerous contemporary case studies, including FrankGehry's Experiential Music Center in Seattle (thin skins), RenzoPiano's Rue de Meaux housing in Paris (terra cotta cladding), andMario Botta's San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (prefabricatedbrick panels).

Commodus\u2019s passion for hunting animals was so fervent that he dreamt of shooting a tiger, an elephant, and a hippopotamus; his prowess was such that people claimed he never missed when hurling his javelin or firing arrows from his bow. For fourteen days near the end of AD 192, the emperor mounted one of the most lavish and spectacular gladiatorial games Rome had ever seen. Commodus himself was the star attraction, and people rushed from all over Italy to witness the spectacle. But this slaughter was simply the warm-up act to the main event: the emperor was also planning to fight as a gladiator. Why did Roman rulers spend vast resources on such over-the-top displays\u2014and why did some emperors appear in them as combatants? Why did the Roman rabble enjoy watching the slaughter of animals and the sight of men fighting to the death? And how best can we in the modern world understand what was truly at stake in the circus and the arena? In The Day Commodus Killed a Rhino, Jerry Toner set out to answer these questions by vividly describing what it would have been like to attend Commodus\u2019 fantastic shows and watch one of his many appearances as both hunter and fighter. Highlighting the massive logistical effort needed to supply the games with animals, performers, and criminals for execution, the book reveals how blood and gore were actually incidental to what really mattered. Gladiatorial games played a key role in establishing a forum for political debate between the rulers and the ruled. Roman crowds were not passive: they were made up of sophisticated consumers with their own political aims, which they used the games to secure. In addition, the games also served as a pure expression of what it meant to be a true Roman. Drawing on notions of personal honor, manly vigor, and sophisticated craftsmanship, the games were a story that the Romans loved to tell themselves about themselves.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781421415864"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1421415860"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Day_Commodus_Killed_a_Rhino.html?hl=&id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]}
