This book is aimed at advanced students who are studying forensic science or analytical chemistry, faculty and researchers, and practitioners such as crime laboratory bench scientists. The authors will assume that the reader will have an introductory knowledge of forensic science and forensic chemistry and will have had analytical, organic and instrumental chemistry. None of the major analytical chemical techniques will have separate treatments in the book, with the exception of forensic microscopy, which will have a chapter because many students in chemistry and forensic science do not get dedicated classes in this area. The book will have separate chapters on all of the major areas of forensic chemistry and, in addition, will have a chapter devoted to chemometrics, which is the statistical treatment of large amounts of data to discover groupings, similarities and differences among the data. Each chapter will be written by an acknowledged international expert in that area. Each author will be given detailed instructions as to the intended audience, as well as expected breadth and depth of coverage of the material in the hopes that this will minimize the problem of uneven coverage of topics and chapters that often occurs in edited books. Although each of the types of evidence covered in the book use methods of analysis that lie outside chemistry, these will be mentioned only for completeness in passing. The emphasis will be on the use of chemical tools in evidence analysis. This book is designed to be either a text book for an advanced forensic chemistry course, or a treatise in forensic chemistry for the scientist who wants to learn the subject in some depth.

How did Kirsten K. s body wind up at the bottom of a lake and what do wedding cake ingredients, soil samples, radioactive decay, bone age, blood stains, bullet matching, and drug lab evidence reveal about whodunit? These mysteries are at the core of this teacher resource book, which meets the unique needs of high school chemistry classes in a highly memorable way. The book makes forensic evidence the foundation of a series of eight hands-on, week-long labs. As you weave the labs throughout the year and students solve the case, the narrative provides vivid lessons in why chemistry concepts are relevant and how they connect. All chapters include case information specific to each performance assessment and highlight the related national standards and chemistry content. Chapters provide: Teacher guides to help you set up Student performance assessments A suspect file to introduce the characters and new information about their relationships to the case Samples of student work that has been previously assessed (and that serves as an answer key for you) Grading rubrics Using <em>Forensics in Chemistry</e> as your guide, you will gain the confidence to use inquiry-based strategies and performance-based assessments with a complex chemistry curriculum.

of Uranium", "subtitle": "Environmental, Forensic, Nuclear, and Toxicological Applications", "authors": ["Zeev Karpas"], "publisher": "CRC Press", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21", "description": "Accurate uranium analysis, and particularly for isotope measurements, is essential in many fields, including environmental studies, geology, hydrogeology, the nuclear industry, health physics, and homeland security. Nevertheless, only a few scientific books are dedicated to uranium in general and analytical chemistry aspects in particular. Analytical Chemistry of Uranium: Environmental, Forensic, Nuclear, and Toxicological Applications covers the fascinating advances in the field of analytical chemistry of uranium. Exploring a broad range of topics, the book focuses on the analytical aspects of industrial processes that involve uranium, its presence in the environment, health and biological implications of exposure to uranium compounds, and nuclear forensics. Topics include: Examples of procedures used to characterize uranium in environmental samples of soil, sediments, vegetation, water, and air Analytical methods used to examine the rigorous specifications of uranium and its compounds deployed in the nuclear fuel cycle Health aspects of exposure to uranium and the bioassays used for exposure assessment Up-to-date analytical techniques used in nuclear forensics for safeguards in support of non-proliferation, including single particle characterization Each chapter includes an overview of the topic and several examples to demonstrate the analytical procedures.

Forensic analysts use a variety of tools and techniques to achieve this, many of which use light. Light is not always the forensic analyst\u2019s friend however, as light can degrade samples and alter results. This book details the analysis of a range of molecular systems by light-based techniques relevant to forensic science, as well as the negative effects of light in the degradation of forensic evidence, such as the breakage of DNA linkages during DNA profiling. The introductory chapters explain how chemiluminescence and fluorescence can be used to visualise samples and the advantages and limitations of available technologies. They also discuss the limitations of our knowledge about how light could alter the physical nature of materials, for example by breaking DNA linkages during DNA profiling or by modifying molecular structures of polymers and illicit drugs. The book then explains how to detect, analyse and interpret evidence from materials such as illicit drugs, agents of bioterrorism, and textiles, using light-based techniques from microscopy to surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

In early twentieth-century New York, poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime. Science had no place in the Tammany Hall-controlled coroner's office, and corruption ran rampant. However, with the appointment of chief medical examiner Charles Norris in 1918, the poison game changed forever.

A plant\u2019s anatomy and its ecological requirements are in some cases species specific and require taxonomic verification; correct interpretation of botanical evidence can give vital information about a crime scene or a suspect or victim. The use of botanical evidence in legal investigations in North America is relatively recent. The first botanical testimony to be heard in a North American court concerned the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh\u2019s baby boy and the conviction of Bruno Hauptmann in 1935. Today, forensic botany encompasses numerous subdisciplines of plant science, such as plant anatomy, taxonomy, ecology, palynology, and diatomology, and interfaces with other disciplines, e.g., molecular biology, limnology and oceanography. Forensic Plant Science presents chapters on plant science evidence, plant anatomy, plant taxonomic evidence, plant ecology, case studies for all of the above, as well as the educational pathways for the future of forensic plant science.

The methods are based on molecular characteristics of the drugs belonging to each individual class of compounds, so it will be clear how the current methods are adaptable to future new drugs that appear in the market.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781315313153"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1315313154"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 478, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Forensic+chemistry&hl=&cd=57&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 19057, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 19057, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DM5JDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19057000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19057000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chromatographic_Techniques_in_the_Forens-sample-epub.acsm?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chromatographic_Techniques_in_the_Forens-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DM5JDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "There is a dramatic rise of novel drug use due to the increased popularity of so-called designer drugs."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "1KWaDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "/ZqH2aZDVNc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1KWaDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Forensic Science", "subtitle": "An Introduction to Scientific and Investigative Techniques, Fifth Edition", "authors": ["Suzanne Bell"], "publisher": "CRC Press", "publishedDate": "2019-05-21", "description": "Covering a range of fundamental topics essential to modern forensic investigation, the fifth edition of the landmark text Forensic Science: An Introduction to Scientific and Investigative Techniques presents contributions and case studies from the personal files of experts in the field. In the fully updated 5th edition, Bell combines these testimonies into an accurate and engrossing account of cutting edge of forensic science across many different areas. Designed for a single-term course at the undergraduate level, the book begins by discussing the intersection of law and forensic science, how things become evidence, and how courts decide if an item or testimony is admissible. The text invites students to follow evidence all the way from the crime scene into laboratory analysis and even onto the autopsy table. Forensic Science offers the fullest breadth of subject matter of any forensic text available, including forensic anthropology, death investigation (including entomology), bloodstain pattern analysis, firearms, tool marks, and forensic analysis of questioned documents. Going beyond theory to application, this text incorporates the wisdom of forensic practitioners who discuss the real cases they have investigated. Textboxes in each chapter provide case studies, current events, and advice for career advancement. A brand-new feature, Myths in Forensic Science, highlights the differences between true forensics and popular media fictions.

She had little basketball experience, never having played on a high school team\u2014her high school didn\u2019t even have girl\u2019s basketball. Despite her inexperience, Winstel served NKU as a talented student athlete, but her legacy didn\u2019t end there. Appointed head coach at NKU in 1983, she gained a reputation as one of the most successful coaches in women\u2019s college basketball history with more than 500 wins. Winstel garnered these victories in an athletic landscape vastly different from the one she knew as an NKU undergraduate. Many of the student-athletes on her twenty-first-century squads have been playing organized basketball for most of their lives. In a post\u2013title IX America, more women than ever are involved in team sports and their teams attract a large following of enthusiasts. NKU professor Robert K. Wallace, one of many passionate fans of the Norse, has brought his appreciation for the team\u2019s players and their accomplishments to Thirteen Women Strong: The Making of a Team. Chronicling the 2006\u201307 season of twelve remarkable student-athletes and their legendary coach, Wallace was granted unprecedented access to the team. Sitting in on closed meetings and practice sessions, he follows the players through grueling training drills, intensely close games, exhilarating wins, and anguished losses. During the 2005\u201306 season, a squad of NKU women with no seniors achieved unanticipated success, earning a 27\u20135 record that led to a Great Lakes Valley Conference championship. The entire team returned the following season to expectations of even greater success, but their 2006\u201307 season was plagued by injuries and other major obstacles. After a string of tough losses, the women mounted a comeback to earn a 21\u20138 record and reach the NCAA Division II Tournament once again. The team\u2019s story is one of loss, triumph, and personal growth. Thirteen Women Strong profiles each member of the team, including the coach. Wallace provides keen insight into the emotional and physical demands of high-level competition. Exploring the impact of Title IX legislation on women\u2019s collegiate sports with the critical eye of a scholar and the love of a fan, Wallace documents the story of how thirteen women faced high expectations and difficult trials to come together as a team, their growth culminating in the 2007\u201308 national championship. Thirteen Women Strong is a fascinating study of this dynamic group of female student-athletes and their renowned leader.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "081312638X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813126388"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QEpgv0X6BVQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QEpgv0X6BVQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QEpgv0X6BVQC&pg=PA220&dq=Forensic+chemistry&hl=&cd=62&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEpgv0X6BVQC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEpgv0X6BVQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2641.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2641.09, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEpgv0X6BVQC&rdid=book-QEpgv0X6BVQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2641090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2641090000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QEpgv0X6BVQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Called <b>chemical</b> analysis, this aspect has two major divisions: qualitative analysis<br>\n, which seeks to determine what ...

Production, both the chemical and physical structure, and the properties of these materials is required in order to determine the value of fibre evidence. This includes knowing production figures, fashion changes, sudden arrivals of new materials, dye variability, and numerous other factors that may have a bearing on the information obtained. Fully updated with the latest advances, Forensic Examination of Fibres, Third Edition continues in the tradition of the First (1992) and Second Editions (1999) as the premier text on the subject of forensic fibre analysis. The international team of contributing authors detail the recovery of the evidence\u2014through the different stages of laboratory examination\u2014to the evaluation of the meaning of findings. The coverage has been considerably expanded, and all material, has been revised and wholly updated. Topics covered include examining damaged textiles, infrared microspectroscopy and thin layer chomatography, and colour analyses. This edition also highlights the critical role of quality assurance in ensuring the reliability of the technical observations and results, and, in doing so, looks at the implications of supervisory managers and labs in the accurate and responsible analysis of such evidence.

Increasingly, it is being integrated into modern chemical instrumentation and is of value as a powerful analytical tool across many scientific disciplines. Designed to serve as a primary resource for undergraduate or graduate students, An Introduction to Microscopy helps students master the foundational principles of microscopy. Intentionally concise, this text does not attempt to cover all aspects of all types of microscopy such as polarizing light and fluorescence. Instead, the authors\u2019 intent is to provide students with the basic knowledge necessary to explore and understand these more advanced techniques. The authors draw from their own extensive backgrounds in forensic identification to explain the methods and ways in which microscopy shapes every investigation. All nine chapters include questions and most include simple exercises related to the material covered. Numerous figures and photographs supplement the text and explain the procedures and principles introduced. A glossary is included as well as a convenient list of abbreviations, and references to more in-depth readings. Offers a Fundamental Approach for Students in all Fields The material assumes basic mathematics skill through algebra and a basic knowledge of fundamental chemistry and physics (essential for understanding optics). Although the authors used the high-quality microscopes found in their laboratories to produce the images found in the book, the information and methods can be applied to any type of microscope to which students have access. Understanding the fundamentals of microscopy provides students with a relevant and marketable skill that can be readily applied in many fields, even if the students have not had significant academic training in the subject. Furthermore, by understanding various aspects of microscopy, students will begin to understand the science behind other related areas, such as spectroscopy, optics, and any number of applications involving analytical instrumentation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439882436"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439882436"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 180, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR13&dq=Forensic+chemistry&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7845.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7845.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-VFzNBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7845820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7845820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/An_Introduction_to_Microscopy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VFzNBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Dr. Suzanne Bell earned a BS with a dual major in <b>chemistry</b> and police science (<br>\ncriminal justice) at Northern Arizona University, followed by an MS in <b>forensic</b> <br>\nscience from the University of New Haven.

If you have only a vague concept of what forensic science is, this book will provide the answer. Aimed at non-scientists, or those with limited scientific knowledge, Crime Scene to Court covers all three main areas of an investigation where forensic science is practised, namely the scene of the crime, the forensic laboratory and the court. Coverage includes details of how crime scene and forensic examinations are conducted in the United Kingdom, the principles of crime scene investigations and the importance of this work in an investigation, and courtroom procedures and the role of the expert witness. The latest methods and techniques used in crime scene investigation and forensic laboratories are reported, cases are presented to illustrate why and how examinations are performed to generate forensic evidence and there is a bibliography for each chapter which provides further material for those readers wishing to delve deeper into the subject. This revised and updated edition also includes coverage on changes in professional requirements, the latest developments in DNA testing and two new chapters on computer based crimes and Bloodstain Pattern Analysis. Ideal for those studying forensic science or law, the book is intended primarily for teaching and training purposes.

Such examinations return various kinds of information, including quantitative data. From the forensic point of view, the most suitable way to evaluate evidence is the likelihood ratio. This book provides a collection of recent approaches to the determination of likelihood ratios and describes suitable software, with documentation and examples of their use in practice. The statistical computing and graphics software environment R, pre-computed Bayesian networks using Hugin Researcher and a new package, calcuLatoR, for the computation of likelihood ratios are all explored. Statistical Analysis in Forensic Science will provide an invaluable practical guide for forensic experts and practitioners, forensic statisticians, analytical chemists, and chemometricians. Key features include: Description of the physicochemical analysis of forensic trace evidence. Detailed description of likelihood ratio models for determining the evidential value of multivariate physicochemical data. Detailed description of methods, such as empirical cross-entropy plots, for assessing the performance of likelihood ratio-based methods for evidence evaluation.

The mass spectrometer is now an integral part of every forensic laboratory, resulting in greater analytical accuracy, more reliable identification, and lower detection limits. As the instrumental method of choice among forensic analysts, the mass spectrometer continues to pave the way for innovative applications in forensic analysis. Exploring the latest developments in the field, Advances in Forensic Applications of Mass Spectrometry provides a comprehensive reference guide to forensic applications using modern mass spectrometry techniques. The book features methods developed from advanced instrumentation, drug detection and toxicological analysis, and methodology of applications of stable isotope ratios.

It is much more in-depth and much broader in scope, and the information gleaned from any evidence yields so much more information than it had in the past because of incredible advances in analytic instruments and crucial procedures at both the crime scene and in the lab. Many practices have gone digital, a concept not even fathomed ten years ago. And from the first collection of evidence to its lab analysis and interpretation to its final presentation in court, ethics has become an overriding guiding principle. That\u2019s why this new edition of this classic handbook is indispensable. The Forensic Laboratory Handbook Procedures and Practice includes thirteen new chapters written by real-life practitioners who are experts in the field. It covers the tried and true topics of fingerprints, trace evidence, chemistry, biology, explosives and arson, forensic anthropology, forensic pathology, forensic documents, firearms and toolmarks. This text also addresses an array of new topics including accreditation, certification, ethics, and how insects and bugs can assist in determining many facts including a margin of time of death. In the attempt to offer a complete and comprehensive analysis The Forensic Laboratory Handbook Procedures and Practice also includes a chapter discussing the design of a laboratory. In addition, each chapter contains educational requirements needed for the discipline it covers.

Drawn from contributions made at the latest gathering in Lyon, France, Interpol\u2019s Forensic Science Review is a one-source reference providing a comprehensive literature review of each of the subject areas. Divided into five sections spanning the spectrum of forensic analysis, the book begins with chemical criminalistics, starting with a chapter on the forensic examination of fibres. Next, it examines firearms and ballistics, toolmarks, footwear impressions, and other contact marks such as tire treads. A chapter on forensic geology includes related sciences such as palynology. The first section concludes with a review of articles concerning paint and glass and methods for analysis of these substances. The second section focuses on drugs and toxicology. It examines improvements in the detection and analysis of abused substances, highlighting tests that are faster, more discriminatory, more sensitive, and less costly, providing hundreds of references to various studies conducted worldwide. Shifting to an exploration of electronic evidence, the next section begins with forensic audio and visual evidence and then moves to digital evidence found on computers and telecommunication and electronic multimedia devices, an area that has exploded in technological progress since the last symposium. The fourth section of the book begins with a discussion of hazardous materials, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear substances. It discusses new developments in environmental forensic science, with an increased emphasis on the field work necessary in investigation as well as advice on suggested equipment and online educational resources. The section concludes with a discussion of the analysis and detection of explosives and explosive residues, as well as scientific methods applied to fire cause and fire debris analysis. Finally, the book focuses on individual identification. It examines biological evidence screening and advances in DNA profiling during the past three years and explores questioned documents with a discussion of ink analysis and handwriting. The book concludes with a survey of the literature concerning fingerprints, bitemarks, and other impressions. The international scope of contributions to this volume makes it the most comprehensive source of information in the field today. Supplemented by hundreds of references to periodicals, textbooks, internet sources, and the proceedings of various working groups, the book identifies trends and their potential effects on forensic science and creates bridges with the international forensic science community supporting Interpol\u2019s mission.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439826591"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439826595"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 798, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Forensic+chemistry&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&dq=Forensic+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Interpol_s_Forensic_Science_Review.html?hl=&id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Interpol_s_Forensic_Science_Review-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book concludes with a survey of the literature concerning fingerprints, bitemarks, and other impressions.

Poisons: An Introduction for Forensic Investigators is a concise yet comprehensive overview of toxicants and unanticipated circumstances in which poisoning occurs. This book expands awareness of poisoning possibilities, heightens recognition of the toxic potential of many substances, and provides information to aid in focusing investigations. Poisons discusses life-threatening toxic substances and agents that modify behavior to achieve criminal goals. These include drugs that facilitate sexual assaults and robberies, and those found in medical child abuse and drug-product tampering. More than 230 case studies illustrate both unintentional and intentional poisoning and highlight situations where poisoning may not immediately be apparent. Information is included in pertinent criminal poisoning cases to illustrate the temperament of poisoners, their relationship to victims, their basis for poison selection, and their method of administration. Since Poisons is written by a single author, the discussions, format, educational level, and terminology remain consistent to aid crime scene investigators, homicide detectives, forensic scientists, death investigators, toxicologists, medical examiners, attorneys, and students.

The report cited the need for standardized practices and the accreditation of crime labs. No longer can the forensic community take the position that cross-examination in a courtroom will expose weaknesses in methodology and execution. Quality Management in Forensic Science covers a wide spectrum of forensic disciplines, relevant ISO and non-ISO standards, accreditation and quality management systems necessary in any forensic science laboratory.

In fact, their equipment is usually simple, their chemicals household products, and their education basic. Most of the time the elements at the scene are perfectly legal to sell and own. It is only in the combination of all these elements that the lab becomes the scene of a criminal operation. Forensic Investigation of Clandestine Laboratories guides you, step-by-step, through the process of recognizing these illegal manufacturing operations. Then it shows you how to prove it in the courtroom. In non-technical language this book details: How to recognize a clandestine lab How to process the site of a clandestine lab How to analyze evidence in the examination laboratory What to derive from the physical evidence How to present the evidence in court The identification and investigation of a clandestine lab, and the successful prosecution of the perpetrators, is a team effort. A collaboration of law enforcement, forensic experts, scientists, and criminal prosecutors is required to present a case that definitively demonstrates how a group of items with legitimate uses are being used to manufacture an illegal controlled substance.

Throughout history, this procedure has been used to establish difficult identifications, including Adolph Hitler, Eva Braun, Lee Harvey Oswald, and actor William Holden. Other essential applications of forensic dentistry include mass disaster investigations, evaluating bite marks and bitemark evidence in death investigations, child abuse investigations, and in civil litigation for evaluating oral or temporomandibular injuries related to accidents. This book explains these procedures in a comprehensive way that takes you step-by-step through the world of forensic dental investigations. The areas of forensic dentistry have come a long way in recent years. New and unique discussions offer information that will benefit professionals faced with many of the current aspects of the science. Topics include how to deal with a trial or an aggressive attorney and how to assess buried crime scene evidence (the application of forensic geotaphonomy in forensic archaeology). Forensic Dentistry illustrates the proper handling and evaluation of dental evidence. Its broad coverage also includes important information for legal and police science professionals who must properly evaluate and present dental findings. This book covers all standard examination practices of dental evidence, including identification of unknown individuals (age, race, sex). Whether you are a medical examiner or a pathologist who needs to know about the proper handling and evaluation of dental evidence, a legal or police science professional who needs to know how to deal with the proper presentation of dental findings in a court of law, or a dentist who wants to use your training and experience in a unique, interesting, and challenging way, this book is for you!", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1420048317"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781420048315"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fQeMCINVeSEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fQeMCINVeSEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fQeMCINVeSEC&pg=PA2&dq=Forensic+chemistry&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fQeMCINVeSEC&dq=Forensic+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Forensic_Dentistry.html?hl=&id=fQeMCINVeSEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Forensic_Dentistry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=fQeMCINVeSEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fQeMCINVeSEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This presumed relationship is known as Locard&#39;s principle and is the basis for <br>\nmuch of what is attempted in the fields of criminalistics and <b>forensic chemistry</b>. <br>\nThe development and application of molecular biology techniques, especially <br>\nDNA&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6-54DgAAQBAJ", "etag": "M5fZvc89Fck", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6-54DgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Modern Nuclear Chemistry", "authors": ["Walter D.

HPLC has caused a revolution in biological and pharmaceutical chemistry. Approximately two thirds of the publications on HPLC are concerned with problems from this area of life science. Biotechnology, where it is necessary to isolate substances from complicated mixtures, is likely to give further impetus to the dissemination of modern liquid chromatog raphy in columns, particularly on the preparative scale. This book presents, by means of examples, the application of HPLC to various fields, as well as fundamental discussions of chromatographic methods. The quality of the analytical result is decisively dependent on the qualities of the equipment employed (by Colin, Guiochon, and Martin). Especially the demands are discussed that are placed on the components of the instrument including those for data acquisition and processing. The section on \"quantitative analy sis\" (by ABhauer, Ullner) covers besides the principles also the problems of ensuring the quality of the data in detail.
