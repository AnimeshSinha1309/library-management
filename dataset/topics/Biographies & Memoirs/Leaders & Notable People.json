"subtitle": "Insights from the World's Leading CEOs", "authors": ["Saul Berman", "Ragna Bell", "Peter Korsten"], "publishedDate": "2010", "description": "The first 'essential business read' of 2010 World's Leading CEOs provide key insights for business success in the new economic environment. More than twelve hundred of the world's senior business executives, CEOs and public sector leaders have candidly contributed their latest insights and opinions to a new book, Rethinking the Enterprise: Insights from the World's Leading CEOs. Rethinking the Enterprise is the first essential text for all business leaders to consider as 2010 begins and the economy regains momentum. The book starts by setting out the findings of IBM's third biennial Global CEO Study which draws on in-depth conversations with 1200+ business leaders, who represent a diverse range and scale of industries, territories and approaches.The interviews took place during the most complex and difficult of economic times, when organizations faced not only just a global downturn, but concurrently an unprecedented ? and fast accelerating ? rate of change.In their introductory chapter The Enterprise of the Future, editors Saul Berman, Peter Korsten and Ragna Bell of IBM note that organizations are now rethinking their strategy and business models, ?what value they deliver, where to compete, how to take advantage and how to position for leadership in the new environment?. The editor's analysis of any early ?winners? from the global financial crisis confirms three broad strategies: focus on value; exploit opportunities and act with speed. Importantly, for all current or aspiring leaders and senior executives in Australian business and government, Rethinking the Enterprise highlights the necessary actions to implement these strategies successfully; and how to best set the stage for leadership in the new, emerging economic environment. For more in-depth consideration and analysis of the challenges posed by this new environment, the editors have also selected the valuable perspectives of leading international business leaders from companies including IKEA, Publicis Groupe, Verizon, Li & Fung and Coca-Cola. These critical ?advice? chapters are detailed yet easy-to absorb, including: -Making change work-Closing the change gap-The path forward-New models for customer-focused leadership-The R-O-I of globally integrated operations-Strategies for enabling global integration-Seizing the advantage-When and how to innovate your business model-Leading a sustainable enterprise-Leveraging insight and information to act", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0646524941"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780646524948"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 158, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Chief executive officers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6gNrQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6gNrQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6gNrQgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Leaders&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6gNrQgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Leaders&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Rethinking_the_Enterprise.html?hl=&id=6gNrQgAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6gNrQgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Ktm_jwEACAAJ", "etag": "w0/KPUeq7nY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Ktm_jwEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "9 Things a Leader Must Do", "authors": ["Henry Cloud"], "publisher": "Integrity Pub", "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "\"A simple roadmap to help leaders, and those who want to become leaders, arrive at greater levels of personal growth and corporate influence\" --Provided by publisher.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1591454840"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781591454847"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 128, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ktm_jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ktm_jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ktm_jwEACAAJ&dq=subject:Leaders&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ktm_jwEACAAJ&dq=subject:Leaders&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/9_Things_a_Leader_Must_Do.html?hl=&id=Ktm_jwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ktm_jwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vujfAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "gAgJvENyg4A", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vujfAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Asian Leaders", "subtitle": "A Bibliography", "authors": ["Herbert E.

They explore the legacy of women who were fundamental in the development of a sense of place and community, both on and off campus. Their contributions to community is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. To read this book, lovingly compiled in celebration of the history of the Faculty Women's Club, is to share in a full spectrum of the lives of women. The stories of the women, who have in common an affiliation with the University of Calgary and the city of Calgary, represent the issues and experiences of Canadian women broadly over the past fifty years and remind us of how women embrace their challenges, value one another, accomplish their mutual goals together, and live joyfully.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier":

They have chosen to be leaders by virtue of their motivation to exercise positive influence and action in their private and personal lives. They are assuming ownership of theircommunities as well responsiblity for providing leadership in these communities. In reflecting their own life experiences, these younger leaders are learning from their own pasts, building upon proven lessons and purposefully enhancing their own leadership growth. Written as stories of leadership journeys, this collection is inspirational for all who are interested in leadership and mentoring. Unlike the usual leadership story, those of this collection are not about politicians, traditional leaders or celebrities. Instead it is about young ordinary students who are sharing their own leadershipstories as children, parents, employees, mentees and mentors.While written primarily for Pacific audiences, other readers are sure to find inspiration in the power of these stories, told in their natural Pacific styles.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0475123409"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780475123404"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 232, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Leaders"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-CdzPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-CdzPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-CdzPgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Leaders&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-CdzPgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Leaders&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Living_and_Leaving_a_Legacy_of_Hope.html?hl=&id=-CdzPgAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-CdzPgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KjWRxgEACAAJ", "etag": "ae/Jn8m5rBg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KjWRxgEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Digital Governance", "subtitle": "Leading and Thriving in a World of Fast-changing Technologies", "authors": ["Jeremy Swinfen Green", "Stephen Daniels"], "publishedDate": "2019", "description": "\"Digital Governance provides managers with a simple and jargon-free introduction to the impact that digital technology can have on the governance of their organisations. Digital technology is at the heart of any enterprise today, changing business processes and the way we work. But this technology is often used inefficiently, riskily or inappropriately. Worse perhaps, many organisational leaders fail to grasp the opportunities it offers and thus fail to \"transform\" their organisations through the use of technology. This book provides an explanation of the basic issues around the opportunities and risks associated with digital technology. It describes the role that digital technology can play across organisations (and not just behind the locked doors of the IT department) giving boards and top management the insight to develop strategies for investing in and exploiting digital technology as well as arming them with the knowledge required to ask the right questions of specialists and to detect when the answers given are evasive or irrelevant. International in its scope, this essential book covers the fundamental principles of digital governance such as leadership, capability, accountability for value creation and transparency of reporting, integrity and ethical behaviour\"--", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0429022379"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780429022371"}], "readingModes": {"text": false,

Post"], "publisher": "University of Michigan Press", "publishedDate": "2010-02-11", "description": "In an age when world affairs are powerfully driven by personality, politics require an understanding of what motivates political leaders such as Hussein, Bush, Blair, and bin Laden. Through exacting case studies and the careful sifting of evidence, Jerrold Post and his team of contributors lay out an effective system of at-a-distance evaluation. Observations from political psychology, psycholinguistics and a range of other disciplines join forces to produce comprehensive political and psychological profiles, and a deeper understanding of the volatile influences of personality on global affairs.

Yet questions about the performance of these leaders, and specifically what psychological or external factors determine whether they will be innovative and effective or will muddle through, have received surprisingly little attention. An introductory section presents main themes in the study of innovative leadership and in addition reviews the existing, inadequate state of our knowledge. The two subsequent sections further explore the basic questions through case studies of leaders in democratic systems and in transitional or authoritarian systems. By looking at the individual records of such major twentieth-century leaders as De Gaulle, Adenauer, Gandhi, Gorbachev, Sadat, and several American presidents, the authors contribute fresh insights about the particular leaders, consider how the type of system in which they functioned enhanced or constrained their innovativeness, and shed light on the broader questions of what factors encourage

A serious crisis looms in American management today. More and more CEOs are failing; there remains an acute shortage of capable replacements. The true dilemma in leadership is the stagnant state of corporate leadership development. Because companies fail to hone their unit managers' leadership abilities, they are never able to fill their succession pipelines. With unit managers stagnating, companies have difficulty executing at every level, compounding the crisis. In I>Leaders at All Levels, bestselling author Ram Charan shows how top companies approach leadership development as a core competency, recognizing that an adaptable leadership pool is a competitive advantage, and focusing their attention on bringing out the best in the leaders they have. Charan reveals exactly what's wrong with corporate leadership development and tells how to make it right.

It will equally benefit undergraduate students enrolled in leadership courses, graduate students preparing for leadership roles, and nurses already established in leadership roles. [This book] deepened my love for nursing and reinforced why nursing is repeatedly ranked the most trusted profession.\" -Susan B. Hassmiller , PhD, RN, FAAN Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Senior Adviser for Nursing Director, Campaign for Action With an emphasis on the qualities that have fostered strong nursing leadership, this book provides a unique perspective on the lives and achievements of the most revered nurses throughout history. It is comprised of biographies of many of nursing's most important activist agents of change, with a focus on those characteristics that enabled them to accomplish their goals and implement changes that improved nursing, health, healthcare, and society. These biographies examine the evolution of nursing and society around the globe and underscore the resourcefulness and political savvy these nurses used to meet the increasingly complex needs of society. Using Kouzes and Posner's five practices of exemplary leadership as a framework, the biographies demonstrate how the nurses used these processes to achieve their goals. Placed within the context and dynamics of each nurse leader's lifetime\u00f3including gender roles, science and technology, religion, politics, and economics--each biography includes a personal history, timeline, accomplishments, anecdotes, and legacy. The book honors such well-known nurse leaders as Florence Nightingale, Clara Barton, and Dorothea Dix, along with less well-known nurse leaders.

As a result, the United States has launched a variety of overt and covert operations in efforts to attack enemy leaders directly, facilitate their overthrow by coup or rebellion, or secure their ouster through external invasion. This book examines a number of leadership attacks from World War II to the present to offer insights into the comparative efficacy of various forms of leadership attacks, their potential coercive and deterrent value, and the possible unintended consequences of their ill-considered use. The book concludes that direct attacks, coups, and rebellions have met with only limited success and, even when successful, have sometimes yielded counterproductive results. Moreover, neither direct attacks nor coups have been of significant coercive or deterrent value, although rebellions have at times provided useful negotiating leverage. By contrast, external invasions have proved to be more efficacious both in shaping the targeted countries' policy and behavior and in exerting coercive effects. The book concludes by outlining the likely conditions under which future leadership attacks are likely to be sanctioned and by delineating the prerequisites of effective use of air power in such contexts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780833032348"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0833032348"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 180, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&pg=PA1&dq=Leaders&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 876.29, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 438.14, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&rdid=book-y92_Ga2gNLoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 876290000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 438140000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Operations_Against_Enemy_Leaders-sample-epub.acsm?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Operations_Against_Enemy_Leaders-sample-pdf.acsm?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=y92_Ga2gNLoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Chapter One INTRODUCTION OBJECTIVES OF <b>LEADERSHIP</b> ATTACKS The <br>\nUnited States has long attempted to use <b>leadership</b> attacks to shape the policy <br>\nand behavior of enemy states and other hostile actors.

This truth means that leadership is critically important to the growth and effectiveness of any church or organization. This is especially true for a new church. In Identifying & Developing Leaders: A Biblical, Historical & Theological Perspective, Dr. Frederick Thompson insightfully provides a firm foundation for the identification and development of leaders to serve with the primary leader. His 20 years of military service and his experiences as a founding pastor has given him a sharpened ability to wed theory and practice. In this work various perspectives are explored in an effort to give clear understanding to the why and how of leadership development. This informative book will undoubtedly be useful to the church as there is always a need to plant new churches. Moreover, well established churches must also identify and develop leaders.

Focusing on today's business realities, Schein draws on a wide range of contemporary research to redefine culture, offers new information on the topic of occupational cultures, and demonstrates the crucial role leaders play in successfully applying the principles of culture to achieve organizational goals.

Christian leaders are not gods. There is a demonic spirit attached to this fleshly worship of man. Idolatry of Christian Leaders is a book which captures your heart from start to finish. Written in a straight forward, honest, and confrontational style, the Holy Spirit compels Christian believers to evaluate their true motives for Christian service and their love relationship with God. Proper heart alignment with God through the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is the book's central theme. Idolatry of Christian Leaders confronts idolatry of Christian leaders, denominations and other aspects of the Church which cause believers to walk in religion, traditions of men and deception.
