If you play it, it's recreation. If you work at it, it's golf.\" --Bob Hope This is an easy to read and understand instructional book to help adult players sharpen their skills. Although most golfers never improve once they reach adulthood, author Bill Kroen wants to help those golfers get past that and take their game to a new level. Readers will learn how to really learn the game (not just how to swing), they'll gain a greater sense of awareness of the total golf experience, and they will finally learn how to take their practice game to the golf course. Drawing on his background in psychology, Kroen directs his readers to envision the results they want. Then they can put what they read into practice without the confusion caused by most instructional books.

The entire spectrum of international perspectives is covered, from US, Korean, and Australian sports to world competition at the highest level of the Olympics and international championships. Whether your interest is attendance at women's events, performance and rewards in women's pro sports, gender issues in US college sports, or international performance and how women compete, this handbook is a must read for any serious fan, and for all serious scholars interested in the impacts of being female on sports performance and competitiveness.' Rodney Fort, University of Michigan, US 'Leeds and Leeds have filled a gaping hole in sports economics with this revealing collection of essays. The economics of women in sports has been too long neglected. By covering everything from women as sports spectators, to women as participants in individual and team sports at the collegiate and professional levels, to women's sports internationally, Title IX, and women's differential response to incentives, this volume not only demonstrates that there is much fertile ground to be studied, but also that the subject matter is both interesting and important.' Andrew Zimbalist, Smith College, US Women's sports have received much less attention from economists than from other social scientists. This Handbook fills that gap with a comprehensive economic analysis of women's sports. It also analyzes how the behavior and treatment of female athletes reflect broad economic forces. Contributors to this volume use current theoretical models and econometric tools to examine the legal, social, and economic forces that affect the experiences of female athletes. They address such traditional topics as discrimination against female athletes and coaches and the effect of athletic events on the economies of host countries. They also apply theory and estimation to new settings, such as how women respond to tournaments in skiing and figure skating or how the growing dominance of Korean women on the LPGA tour is a form of immigration.

It is a game defined by dichotomies -- relaxing, yet frustrating, social, yet solitary -- and between these extremes there is room for much philosophical inquiry. In Golf and Philosophy: Lessons from the Links, a clubhouse full of skilled contributors tee off on a range of philosophical topics within the framework of the fairway. The book's chapters are arranged in the style of an eighteen-hole golf course, with the front nine exploring ethical matters of rationality and social civility in a world of moral hazards and roughs. The back nine pries even deeper, slicing into matters of the metaphysical, including chapters on mysticism, idealism, identity, and meaning. Taken together, the collection examines the intellectual nature of this beloved pastime, considering the many nuances of a sport that requires high levels of concentration, patience, and consistency, as well as upstanding moral character.

Highly skilled, well-trained individuals walk a fine line between task success and failure, with only slightly inadequate task execution leading to the latter. Promoting cross-disciplinary interaction between the human factors and sports science disciplines, Human Factors Methods and Sports Science: A Practical Guide provides practical guidance on a range of methods for describing, representing, and evaluating human, team, and system performance in sports domains. Traditionally, the application of human factors and ergonomics methods in sports has focused on the biomechanical, physiological, environmental, and equipment-related aspects of sports performance. However, various human factors methods, applied historically in the complex safety critical domains, are suited to describing and understanding sports performance. This book delineates the similarities in the concepts requiring investigation within sports and the more typical human factors domains. The book\u2019s focus on cognitive and social human factors methods rather than mainly on the application of physiological ergonomics approaches sets it apart from other books in either field. It covers eight categories of human factor methods: data collection, task analysis, cognitive task analysis, human error identification, situation awareness measurement, workload measurement, team performance assessment, and interface evaluation methods. Constructed so that each chapter can be read non-linearly and independently from one another, the book provides an introduction and overview to each Human Factors topic area, and of each method discussed, along with practical guidance on how to apply them. It also includes detailed descriptions of the different methods, example applications, and theoretical rationale. This allows the concepts to be easily found and digested, and the appropriate method to be easily selected and applied.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1420072188"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781420072181"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 378, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfipLLw1nioC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfipLLw1nioC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OfipLLw1nioC&pg=PA83&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OfipLLw1nioC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OfipLLw1nioC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7285.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7285.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OfipLLw1nioC&rdid=book-OfipLLw1nioC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7285320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7285320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Human_Factors_Methods_and_Sports_Science-sample-epub.acsm?id=OfipLLw1nioC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Human_Factors_Methods_and_Sports_Science-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OfipLLw1nioC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OfipLLw1nioC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Example For this example, selected CWA phases were conducted for the <b>golf</b> <br>\ndomain.

M. Mikell Johnson shows how these women-who were seemingly far removed from the white, male, privileged world of the country club-broke both color and gender barriers to become golfers. This book traces the history of how African American women got involved in golf. Title VI and Title IX alleviated some of the racial and financial burdens for some young women in high school and college athletics, allowing them to participate in all sports regardless of race, creed, or gender. Women's clubs also provided a stable foundation for female athletes in male-dominated sports. The misinformation, social apathy, financial encumbrances, and, finally, the role of the media in both promoting and preventing black women's opportunities in golf are discussed. \"The African American Woman Golfer: Her Legacy\" identifies over 300 women and their lives in golf. The author also profiles prominent golfers such as Althea Gibson, who crossed the LPGA color line; Helen Webb Harris, who created the first club for black women golfers; and Ann Gregory, who broke the USGA whites only clause in women's golf.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0313349045"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780313349041"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 199, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8mNgjjaJgOAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8mNgjjaJgOAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8mNgjjaJgOAC&pg=PA157&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=53&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8mNgjjaJgOAC&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_African_American_Woman_Golfer.html?hl=&id=8mNgjjaJgOAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_African_American_Woman_Golfer-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8mNgjjaJgOAC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8mNgjjaJgOAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Nike seems the best example of an incubator in today&#39;s world of <b>sports</b>.

By examining classic issues and current trends, the text offers students and practitioners alike a broad base of knowledge with which to challenge the everyday conventions and practices of sport. Joseph Maguire, Grant Jarvie, Louise Mansfield, and Joe Bradley deftly highlight the ways in which sport competitions are shaped more by what happens off the field than on. Using contemporary examples, the authors paint a historically relevant picture of how sport is an integral part of the global order, our local communities, and our individual identities. The text includes the following features: -A straightforward organization and easy-to-read style making it an essential reference for students and professionals studying sociology of sport -Clearly stated objectives and review questions at the start and end of each chapter that give readers a framework for learning and understanding key points throughout the text -Project suggestions in each chapter that allow readers to incorporate learning concepts into hands-on, real-life situations, furthering student comprehension -Narrative case studies based on current issues illustrating the global nature of the modern world of sport -Highlighted examples that allow readers to relate today's sport headlines to issues and trends beyond the final score -Debating points that engage readers in thought-provoking discussions, allowing readers to assess the sociology of sport issues for themselves Part I,\"Sport Inside the World,\" examines a range of global systems, processes, and issues that characterize sport worlds. These include networks, boundaries, conventions, and challenges. Attention is given to issues such as migration, the environment, and politics.

At once contemplative and compelling, The Poetics of Golf explores the links between golf and life by way of art and literature, philosophy and psychology. In portraits of various players?including Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Annika Sorenstam, and Arnold Palmer, among others?Brumer teases out the truths that their games can tell us, not just about golf, but about character and courage.

With a new introduction from golf performance pro Peter Hudson, the multi-million bestselling The Inner Game of Golf resolves this mental interference. It is not a book about how to play golf; it is a book about how to learn golf, and its lessons can be applied to any sport. Putting aside the mechanics of golfing technique and laborious debates about strategy, this classic handbook for golfers of all levels tackles the psychological aspects of the game and reveals how you can perform to your true potential for more than brief moments at a time. Using only his Inner Game principles, without taking a single lesson and playing only once a week, Timothy Gallwey knocked 15 strokes off his game in a year. There is no physical reason why you can't hit perfect drives or sink long putts more consistently. By applying the Inner Game approach to your own game, you too can see phenomenal improvements to your scorecard.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781447288473"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1447288475"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.8.7.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 375, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 262.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kO8NBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 375000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 262500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Inner_Game_of_Golf-sample-epub.acsm?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kO8NBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Before their very eyes, viewers saw Molly grow from a nervous, ne&#39;er do well <br>\n<b>sporting</b> incompetent into a confident, competent tennis player ...

Zimbalist"], "publisher": "Edward Elgar Publishing", "publishedDate": "2012", "description": "From the Olympics to the World Cup, mega sporting events are a source of enjoyment for tens of thousands, but can also be a source of intense debate and controversy. This insightful new Handbook addresses a number of central questions, including: How are host cities selected and under what economic conditions? How are these events organized, and how is local resistance overcome? Based on historical and empirical experience, what are the pitfalls for the organizers of these events? What are the potential economic benefits, including any international image effects? How can the costs be minimized and the benefits maximized for host cities and countries? How do these mega events impact the challenges of globalization and what is their environmental legacy? Compiled and edited by two internationally renowned sports economists, the expert contributions elaborate on the specific mechanisms of the bid processes, analyse the determining factors of winning bids, and illustrate how to construct future bid campaigns. Underpinned by case studies from four continents and by theoretical considerations, the reasons for seemingly systemic cost overruns are explored and analysed, as are the effects on national and regional employment and income, property values, non-traditional economic variables (such as psychological and marketing benefits) and urban branding and transformation. The Handbook also reflects on important elements of design of the games in order to better plan, prepare and allocate resources \u2013 including, for example, sustainability issues and the use of campaigns to secure positive perceptions. This book provides an up-to-date analysis of the financing and economic impact of mega sporting events, as well as a full discussion of how host cities can maximize the benefits from their experience. As such, it will prove a fascinating read for academics, students, researchers and policymakers with an interest in economics and public sector economics generally, and more specifically, in the economics of sport.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780857930279"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0857930273"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 625, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC&pg=PA449&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4473.13, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4473.13, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC&rdid=book-t2YOzxOBo5sC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4473130000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4473130000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/International_Handbook_on_the_Economics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t2YOzxOBo5sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Professional <b>golfers</b> compete in tournaments year round and all over the world. ... <br>\nThe <b>sporting</b> significance of the <b>golf</b> Majors is undeniable, but quantifying the <br>\neconomic significance for the local community is not nearly as straightforward."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "654lMhmFGrIC", "etag": "E8tVJehrw6Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/654lMhmFGrIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Guerilla Golf", "subtitle": "The Complete Guide to Playing Golf on the Mountains, Pastures, City Streets, and Just About Everywhere But the Course", "authors": ["Alex R.

Kroessler's comprehensive and entertaining time line stretches from the pastoral entertainments of the Dutch to the corporate captivity of professional sports. He chronicles events ranging from the truly heroic to the heartbreaking, from moments of municipal greatness to inescapable social change. Through it all he plants the world of sport at the very center of New York's story. Fully illustrated, The Greater New York Sports Chronology covers the spectacle of blood sports like bullbaiting to the birth of baseball, the now-forgotten six-day pedestrian contests, and today's New York City Marathon. Alongside great moments like the Mets' \"amazin'\" World Series win in 1969, Joe Louis's historic bouts with Max Schmeling, Jackie Robinson's breaking of baseball's color line, and Secretariat's remarkable Triple Crown win at Belmont, we encounter the point-shaving scandals of college basketball and the corrupting influence of organized crime in professional boxing. Beyond immortals like Lou Gehrig and Joe Namath, we also find such once well known figures as Joe Lapchick, Marty Glickman, Gertrude Ederle, and Toots Shor. Year by year, this chronology recounts chess matches, America's Cup races, dog shows, golf tournaments, polo matches, tennis games, and more. Kroessler describes the historic venues, boxing arenas, gyms, stadiums, ballparks, and racetracks that have come and gone, yet made New York the undisputed capital of American sport. Witnessing it all, of course, are the greatest fans in the world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231518277"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231518277"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.6.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Greater_New_York_Sports_Chronology.html?hl=&id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Greater_New_York_Sports_Chronology-sample-epub.acsm?id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Greater_New_York_Sports_Chronology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=A2UaAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "At the Meadow Brook Hunt Club on Long Island on November 9, Mrs. Charles S. <br>\nBrown of the Shinnecock Hills <b>Golf</b> Club won the first United States Women&#39;s <br>\nAmateur <b>Golf</b> Championship over 12 other competitors. 1896."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tCSfLuycVwAC", "etag": "SBpnLGx7hpM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tCSfLuycVwAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Upon Further Review", "subtitle": "Sports in American Literature", "authors": ["Michael Cocchiarale", "Scott Emmert"], "publisher": "Greenwood Publishing Group", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "Examines the ways in which American fiction writers and poets have used sports figures and sporting events in order to comment on issues of race, gender, class, and nationality", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0275980502"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780275980504"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 219, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tCSfLuycVwAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tCSfLuycVwAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tCSfLuycVwAC&pg=PA75&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=82&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tCSfLuycVwAC&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Upon_Further_Review.html?hl=&id=tCSfLuycVwAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Upon_Further_Review-sample-epub.acsm?id=tCSfLuycVwAC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Upon_Further_Review-sample-pdf.acsm?id=tCSfLuycVwAC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tCSfLuycVwAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Sports</b> in American Literature Michael Cocchiarale, Scott Emmert ...

One shot is hit like a dream, the next a nightmare. As a result, the game's disciples have embraced any and all techniques endorsed by pros and hackers, poets and philosophers (these days a good walk is often spoiled by tripping over a sandtrap's worth of Zen meditations and mystical tomes). But while so many have journeyed through golf's metaphysics, no one has presented a readable, compelling look at the science of the game -- until now. In Newton on the Tee, accomplished science writer John Zumerchik examines, explores, and explains to us the endless details that make golf such a tantalizing pursuit. Written in language accessible to even the most scientifically disinclined, Zumerchik's book delves into areas of supreme importance to every golfer, including: The Physics of the Sweet Swing: The universal principles shared by all those rhythmic and well-timed swings you see on TV but not in the mirror Mind Over Muscle: How the brain affects and controls the movements of the body (and why confidence is the golfer's most indispensable tool) Getting the Ball from Here to There: Decoding the vagaries of launch angles, spin, lift, and gravity that make the difference between walking happily down the fairway and tramping into the bunkers Probability and Statistics: Understanding the mathematics of golf, and a by-the-numbers appraisal of golf's greatest legends With a firm grasp of both his subject and his 7-iron, Zumerchik takes the reader through all these topics and more, in an entertaining and enlightening work that will give every golfer something to chew on besides his or her nails, and make clear and comprehensible the hundred-and-thirty-five things you shouldn't think about during your backswing.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416596950"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "141659695X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC&pg=PR13&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 869.66, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 434.83, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC&rdid=book-yXr1nsF_z5wC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 869660000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 434830000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Newton_on_the_Tee-sample-epub.acsm?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yXr1nsF_z5wC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... in simple everyday language, the most interesting and useful physics and <br>\nmotor control research applicable to <b>golf</b>.

The concept of 'translation' is often limited solely to language transfer. It is, however, a process occurring within and around most forms of artistic expression. Music, considered a language in its own right, often refers to text discourse and other art forms. In translation, this referential relationship must be translated too. How is music affected by text translation? How does music influence the translation of the text it sets? How is the sense of both the text and the music transferred in the translation process? Combining theory with practice, the book questions the process and role translation has to play in a musical context. It provides a range of case studies across interdisciplinary fields.

This revised work, by leading practitioners in the field, with a foreword by Lord Coe, provides a coherent framework for understanding the principles of sports law in this area, as well as a deep analysis of its key features. The subject is split into various areas of practice: first, regulatory rules, which embrace the constitutional aspect of organised sport, including the disciplinary procedures of the various governing organisations; second, broadcasting and marketing resulting from the commercial exploitation, including sponsorship, of sports clubs, sporting events and players; and third, player's rights and obligations, which embraces a wide range of legal issues including club transfers and player contracts, and issues arising from employment (including discrimination law), personal injury and criminal law. Special attention is paid to the impact of EU and Human Rights law as well as to the influential jurisprudence of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. London 2012 provides an appropriate point at which to assess the current state of the law, as well as a look to the future. The target readership extends from solicitors, barristers and legal advisers, to sports organisations and clubs, corporations involved in marketing and sponsorship, media companies, academics teaching sports law, and sports administrators. \u201cI commend it to everyone who has to administer sport as well as to those who have to advise the administrators or argue cases in the field on whatever side.

A masterful achievement of methodology, it is the first complete epidemiological study and analysis of all catastrophic injuries in all sports and recreational activities that occurred within a large defined geographical area with a large population: ten million people within the province of Ontario between 1986 and 1995. Concentrating on injuries that resulted in death or long term disability, the contributors identify both the personal risk factors for participants and the societal risk factors that are important causes for these kinds of injuries. Providing detailed analysis of 2154 case studies, the contributors demonstrate what went wrong in each event, and show how each injury could have been prevented.

And anyone who has played the royal and ancient sport is an armchair architect at heart. From alterations for their home course to visions of their very own backyard dream course, most golfers would love to test their hands at course design. What makes certain courses timeless? Unlike the venues of other popular recreational sports like tennis and racquetball, whose playing fields are bound by strict measurements that do not vary, each golf course is unique. Offering an endless topographical variety, from short to long, flat or hilly, wet or dry, every course represents a compelling blend of risks versus rewards, with decisions and challenges to test every golfer's game and mental toughness. Combining Geoff Shackelford's informative narrative with detailed illustrations by architect Gil Hanse, Grounds for Golf explains the fundamentals of golf course design in an understandable and entertaining style.

The white paper consists of three policy discussions, on the social value of sport, the economic value of sport, and the organisation of sport. Various action points emerge from the discussions, and with the white paper these form the Action Plan Pierre de Coubertin (included as an appendix to this report). There is a lack of competence for sport under existing EU treaties, though not under the Reform, or Lisbon, treaty. The report examines the content of the white paper and sport and EU law in detail. The Committee believes that sport has distinctive characteristics that need to be taken into account in the application of EU law. Much of the white paper is useful in exploring scope for using existing networks and programmes to support participation in sport. But the Committee does not believe there is any justification or necessity for the Commission to take a more active role in driving the development of policy on sport, and notes the alarm created by the lack of a clear statement on the autonomy of sports organisations.

It is by turns amusing and alarming.\" -- The New Yorker \"Golf is the spine of this shocking, wildly humorous book, but humanity is its flesh and spirit.\" -- Chicago Sun-Times \"Every one of Trump's most disgusting qualities surfaces in golf.\" -- The Ringer An outrageous indictment of Donald Trump's appalling behavior when it comes to golf -- on and off the green -- and what it reveals about his character. Donald Trump loves golf. He loves to play it, buy it, build it, and operate it. He owns 14 courses around the world and runs another five, all of which he insists are the best on the planet. He also claims he's a 3 handicap, almost never loses, and has won an astonishing 18 club championships. How much of all that is true? Almost none of it, acclaimed sportswriter Rick Reilly reveals in this unsparing look at Trump in the world of golf. Based on Reilly's own experiences with Trump as well as interviews with over 100 golf pros, amateurs, developers, and caddies, Commander in Cheat is a startling and at times hilarious indictment of Trump and his golf game. You'll learn how Trump cheats (sometimes with the help of his caddies and Secret Service agents), lies about his scores (the \"Trump Bump\"), tells whoppers about the rank of his courses and their worth (declaring that every one of them is worth $50 million), and tramples the etiquette of the game (driving on greens doesn't help). Trump doesn't brag so much, though, about the golf contractors he stiffs, the course neighbors he intimidates, or the way his golf decisions wind up infecting his political ones. For Trump, it's always about winning. To do it, he uses the tricks he picked up from the hustlers at the public course where he learned the game as a college kid, and then polished as one of the most bombastic businessmen of our time. As Reilly writes, \"Golf is like bicycle shorts. It reveals a lot about a man.\" Commander in Cheat \"paints a side-splitting portrait of a congenital cheater\" (Esquire), revealing all kinds of unsightly truths Trump has been hiding.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316527842"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "031652784X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.10.8.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SWBtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SWBtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SWBtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SWBtDwAAQBAJ&dq=Golf+Sports&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Commander_in_Cheat.html?hl=&id=SWBtDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Commander_in_Cheat-sample-epub.acsm?id=SWBtDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SWBtDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "As Reilly writes, &quot;Golf is like bicycle shorts.

Nicklaus's life is one of extraordinary achievement: Not only did Jack Nicklaus win eighteen PGA Tour Majors, and eight Senior PGA Tour Majors during his one hundred victories worldwide, but he also gained fame as a golf course designer and goodwill ambassador. Internationally acclaimed speaker and specialist medical practitioner Dr. John Tickell was one of millions in awe of the achievements of Jack Nicklaus. He wanted to know the secrets of the great man's enormous success in golf and life. When Dr. Tickell met Jack Nicklaus, he was given many insights into both the physical and mental demands of Nickalus's accomplishments. In this book Dr. Tickell interviews Jack Nicklaus about his remarable success and illustrates the how and the why of that success. Dr. Tickell asked Jack Nicklaus to help him design a golf course. They combined their talents to build a championship course at the Heritage Golf and Country Club in Melbourne, Australia. During their time together, Nicklaus shared with Dr. Tickell the Four Principles of Greatness and other pointers to success. They spent many hours together discussing life and golf, golf and life, and now share with you those lessons on how to become a better golfer and, more important, a better human being. This book presents seventy-two lessons on golf and life from a man who has consistently reached the top of the mountain in all aspects of life.

It is very disturbing to know what we, as African Americans, went through to arrive at where we are, and now appear to be losing ground. Staying abreast of the various sports has alerted me to the declination in numbers and deterioration of African Americans in the sports arena.

It tells the stories that matter: from the gladiators of Rome to the runners of Rift Valley via the innovator-missionaries of Rugby School; from multi-faceted British exports to the Americanisation of professionalism and the Indianisation of cricket. Rob Steen traces the development of these sports which captivate the turnstile millions and the mouse-clicking masses, addressing their key themes and commonalities, from creation myths to match fixing via race, politics, sexuality and internationalism.
