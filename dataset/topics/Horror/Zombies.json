They emerge from foggy cemeteries, frozen barrows, loamy bogs, cursed mines, and gore-spattered operating rooms to prey on the living. But these zombies don't just eat people. They help painters and writers save their faltering careers. They unwittingly push humankind on the quest for fire. They topple evil capitalists and their corporate empires. They fight crime. They fall in love. Join us on a journey into our zombie-filled past...

This currently very influential idea is a threat to all forms of physicalism, and has led some philosophers to give up physicalism and become dualists. It has also beguiled many physicalists, who feel forced to defend increasingly convoluted explanations of why the conceivability of zombies is compatible with their impossibility. Robert Kirk argues that the zombie idea depends on an incoherent view of the nature of phenomenal consciousness. His book has two main aims. One is to demolish the zombie idea once and for all. There are plenty of objections to it in the literature, but they lack intuitive appeal. He offers a striking new argument which reveals fundamental confusions in the implied conception of consciousness. His other main contribution is to develop a fresh and original approach to the true nature of phenomenal consciousness. Kirk argues that a necessary condition is a \"basic package\" of capacities. An important component of his argument is that the necessary cognitive capacities are not as sophisticated as is often assumed. By focusing on humbler creatures than ourselves he avoids some of the distracting complications of our sophisticated forms of cognition. The basic package does not seem to be sufficient for phenomenal consciousness. What is also needed is \"direct activity\"--a special feature of the way the events which constitute incoming perceptual information affect the system. This is an integrated process, to be conceived of holistically, and contrasts sharply with what is often called the \"availability\" or \"poisedness\" of perceptual information. This original, penetrating, and highly readable book will be of interest to all who have a serious concern with the nature of consciousness: not only professional philosophers and students, but also many psychologists and neuroscientists.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199229802"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199229805"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 235, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Zombies_and_Consciousness.html?hl=&id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0kQTDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lRxiGbhKZjUC", "etag": "/HKe2vJDcH8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lRxiGbhKZjUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Christian Zombie Killers Handbook", "subtitle": "Slaying the Living Dead Within", "authors": ["Jeff Kinley"], "publisher": "Thomas Nelson Inc", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11", "description": "02", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781595554383"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1595554386"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 259, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Religion"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 22, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Christian_Zombie_Killers_Handbook.html?hl=&id=lRxiGbhKZjUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lRxiGbhKZjUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "f4WsZwVm_5EC", "etag": "OUOjohXd6AE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/f4WsZwVm_5EC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Twilight of the Dead", "authors": ["Travis Adkins", "David Moody"], "publisher": "Permuted Press", "publishedDate": "2006-10-01", "description": "Courtney Colvin was nearing the end of her teenage years when the undead apocalypse began. She survived, forsaking her youth and innocence, and five years later she continues to exist--albeit lonely--in the fortified town of Eastpointe. Nightmares and the unwelcome advances of Leon Wolfe are the worst things she's dealing with now in her otherwise mundane life. But when a newcomer arrives in town and claims to know the location of the antidote to the zombie plague, it sends Eastpointe into an uproar. To retrieve this cure, she and a group of other survivors must venture outside the relative safety of the compound's walls and into a world ruled and dominated by the flesh-eating undead. Twilight of the Dead puts a new spin on the zombie genre, yet remains true to the classic rules that have already been set forth. A sure-fire reading pleasure for anyone who loves character-driven horror.

And now the much-anticipated sequel has arrived! Caitlin Fletcher is stunned when all the living dead characters from her last adventure in Wonderland vanished from her life. Had it all been a dream?

The dead walked in the fourteenth century, when the Black Death and other catastrophes roiled Europe. They walked in images from World War I, when a generation died horribly in the trenches. They walked in art inspired by the Holocaust and by the atomic attacks on Japan. Now, in the early twenty-first century, the dead walk in stories of the zombie apocalypse, some of the most ubiquitous narratives of post-9/11 Western culture. Zombies appear in popular movies and television shows, comics and graphic novels, fiction, games, art, and in material culture including pinball machines, zombie runs, and lottery tickets. The zombie apocalypse, Greg Garrett shows us, has become an archetypal narrative for the contemporary world, in part because zombies can stand in for any of a variety of global threats, from terrorism to Ebola, from economic uncertainty to ecological destruction. But this zombie narrative also brings us emotional and spiritual comfort. These apocalyptic stories, in which the world has been turned upside down and protagonists face the prospect of an imminent and grisly death, can also offer us wisdom about living in a community, present us with real-world ethical solutions, and invite us into conversation about the value and costs of survival. We may indeed be living with the living dead these days, but through the stories we consume and the games we play, we are paradoxically learning what it means to be fully alive.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190260453"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190260459"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 228, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Living_with_the_Living_Dead.html?hl=&id=bieeDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bieeDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HwryB7ssssYC", "etag": "TwGBO+txXUM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HwryB7ssssYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Dead City", "authors": ["James Ponti"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2012-10-02", "description": "Seventh-grader Molly has always been an outsider, even at New York City's elite Metropolitan Institute of Science and Technology, but that changes when she is recruited to join the Omegas, a secret group that polices and protects zombies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781442441293"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1442441291"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 277, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HwryB7ssssYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HwryB7ssssYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HwryB7ssssYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HwryB7ssssYC&dq=subject:Zombies&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dead_City.html?hl=&id=HwryB7ssssYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HwryB7ssssYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "eK6BTFofHycC", "etag": "Gjy8fUNdP3Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eK6BTFofHycC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Zombielicious", "authors": ["Timothy McGivney"], "publisher": "ManLove Romance Press", "publishedDate": "2010", "description": "Amidst a zombie outbreak, Walt, athletic and confident, meets shy and quiet Joey, the attraction between them both instant and electric.
