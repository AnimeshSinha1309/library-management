By exploring the practice of seventeenth-century anatomy, Anita Guerrini reveals how animals were central to collecting, describing, and classifyingnatural historyand how anatomy and natural history were linked through animal dissection and vivisection. She looks at the early modern animal project, and particularly at Joseph-Guichard Duverney and Claude Perrault, in the context of the court, the city of Paris, and burgeoning audiences for natural history. The Academy and the King s Garden were the two main sites in Paris for the performance of natural history, and much of the Scientific Revolution in France played itself out in these two public institutions. Fascinating stories are culled in \"The Courtiers Anatomists\" to explore the relationships between empiricism and theory, human and animal, the origins of the natural history museum and modern science, and the relationship between science and other cultural activities including art, music, and literature. This book will be warmly welcomed by historians of science, medicine, and France, as well as by early modernists and many others in the growing field of animal studies.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226247663"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "022624766X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 344, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Courtiers_Anatomists.html?hl=&id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rlRzCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TWVhGRckgHsC", "etag": "u7xfUXC0leI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TWVhGRckgHsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "General Anatomy and Musculoskeletal System", "authors": ["Michael Schuenke", "Lawrence M.

Anatomy began as a descriptive science in the days when Latin was the universal scientific language. Early anatomists described the structures they saw in that language, comparing them to common and familiar objects, or borrowing terms from the Greek and Arabic masters before them. In anatomic terminology, common Latin or Greek words are used as such for any part of the body for which the ancients had a name. For many other structures, scientific names have been invented either by using certain classical words which appear to be descriptive of the part concerned, or commonly, by combining Greek or Latin roots to form a new compound term. Memorization of such terms without understanding their meaning can lead to mental indigestion.As an aid to comprehension, this book also presents the roots from which many of these descriptive terms and compounds are derived. For practical convenience, the book is organized into abbreviations, prefixes and suffixes, general terms common to all body regions, short lists for each major body part, and an alphabetical list covering the entire body.

The authors translated those Latin chapters of the Fabrica dedicated to the brain, a milestone in the history of neuroscience. Many chapters are accompanied by a commentary tracking the discoveries that paved the way to our modern understanding of the brain - from the pineal gland that regulates sleep, the fornix and mammillary bodies for memory, the colliculi for auditory and visual perception, and the cerebellum for motor control, to the corpus callosum for interhemispheric cross-talk, the neural correlates of senses, and the methods for dissections. The chapters constitute a primer for those interested in the brain and history of neuroscience. The translation, written with modern anatomical terminology in mind, provides direct access to Vesalius' original work on the brain. Those interested in reading the words of the Renaissance master will find the book an invaluable addition to their Vesalian collection.

This engaging style allows students to bridge the all-important gap between the classroom where anatomy is taught and the clinic where anatomy is used. Michael F. Nolan has assembled learning activities as well as self-assessment tasks as the primary method of teaching for the student. The activities will acquaint students with clinically relevant aspects of human structure in ways similar to those that will be encountered in clinical practice. The self-assessment questions are a great tool that will provide an objective measure of progress and success in learning the material. The emphasis on human structure rather than on a particular skill or group of skills coupled with its unique format of being just text, allows Clinical Applications of Human Anatomy to be the perfect companion for traditional anatomy texts and courses.

Walt Whitman witnessed rapid changes in relations between the living and the dead. In the space of a few decades, dissection evolved from a posthumous punishment inflicted on criminals to an element of preservationist technology worthy of the presidential corpse of Abraham Lincoln. Whitman transitioned from a fervent opponent of medical bodysnatching to a literary celebrity who left behind instructions for his own autopsy, including the removal of his brain for scientific study. Grounded in archival discoveries, Afterlives traces the origins of nineteenth-century America\u2019s preservation compulsion, illuminating the influences of botanical, medical, spiritualist, and sentimental discourses on Whitman\u2019s work. Tuggle unveils previously unrecognized connections between Whitman and the leading \u201cmedical men\u201d of his era, such as the surgeon John H. Brinton, founding curator of the Army Medical Museum, and Silas Weir Mitchell, the neurologist who discovered phantom limb syndrome.

It investigates the \"mania\" for anatomical displays that swept the Italian peninsula, and traces the fashioning of anatomical models as important social, cultural, and political as well as medical tools. Over the course of the eighteenth century, anatomical specimens offered particularly accurate insights into the inner body. Being colored, soft, malleable, and often life-size, they promised to foster anatomical knowledge for different audiences in a delightful way. But how did anatomical models and preparations inscribe and mediate bodily knowledge? How did they change the way in which anatomical knowledge was created and communicated? And how did they affect the lives of those involved in their production, display, viewing, and handling? Examining the circumstances surrounding the creation and early viewing of anatomical displays in Bologna and Naples, Malleable Anatomies addresses these questions by reconstructing how anatomical modeling developed at the intersection of medical discourse, religious ritual, antiquarian and artistic cultures, and Grand Tour display. While doing so, it investigates the development of anatomical modeling in the context of the diverse worlds of visual and material practices that characterized the representation and display of the body in mid-eighteenth-century Italy. Drawing attention to the artisanal dimension of anatomical practice, and to the role of women as both makers and users of anatomical models, it considers how anatomical specimens lay at the center of a composite world of social interactions, which led to the fashioning of modelers as anatomical celebrities. Moreover, it examines how anatomical displays transformed the proverbially gruesome practice of anatomy into an enthralling experience that engaged audiences' senses.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780198736189"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0198736185"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Anatomy&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Malleable_Anatomies.html?hl=&id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uSzVDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LZZ5AAAAQBAJ", "etag": "R9Sv18Lq2Z8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LZZ5AAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Gray's Atlas of Anatomy", "authors": ["Richard Lee Drake"], "publisher": "Elsevier Health Sciences", "publishedDate": "2008-01-01", "description": "Gray's Atlas of Anatomy, the companion resource to the popular Gray's Anatomy for Students, presents a vivid, visual depiction of anatomical structures. Newly updated with a wealth of material to facilitate study, this medical textbook demonstrates the correlation of structures with appropriate clinical images and surface anatomy - essential for proper identification in the dissection lab and successful preparation for course exams. Clinically focused, consistently and clearly illustrated throughout, and logically organized, Gray's Atlas of Anatomy makes it easier than ever to master the essential anatomy knowledge you need! Build on your existing anatomy knowledge with structures presented from a superficial to deep orientation, representing a logical progression through the body. Identify the various anatomical structures of the body and better understand their relationships to each other with the visual guidance of nearly 1,000 exquisitely illustrated anatomical figures. Visualize the clinical correlation between anatomical structures and surface landmarks with surface anatomy photographs overlaid with anatomical drawings. Recognize anatomical structures as they present in practice through more than 270 clinical images - including laparoscopic, radiologic, surgical, ophthalmoscopic, otoscopic, and other clinical views - placed adjacent to anatomic artwork for side-by-side comparison. Quickly access and review key information with more clinical correlations, in addition to new Summary Tables at the end of each chapter that cover relevant muscles, nerves, and arteries. Gain a full understanding of cranial nerves through a brand-new Cranial Nerve Review section that offers a visual guide of the nerves, a table of reflexes, and an additional table of nerve lesions.
