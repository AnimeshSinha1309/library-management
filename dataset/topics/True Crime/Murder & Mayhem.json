Focusing on the one thing he has left, he proposes, and his life finally seems to be coming together again. But this exciting new phase in his life opens a Pandora's Box of chaos that belongs firmly in the past. As Harry is forced to confront unanswered questions about his father, who died ten years ago leaving him his fortune, he becomes obsessed with discovering the truth. The investigation travels from arson in Bermuda to a graveyard in Patras, from the High Table at his father's old Oxford College to a pornographer's den. Does Harry know when to stop, or will he end up making himself judge, jury and executioner of those he holds responsible. It is only at the end of his journey that he comes to realise he is merely a pawn in a much larger game...", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781471111525"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1471111520"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9_0dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9_0dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9_0dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9_0dAwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Ghost_at_the_Door.html?hl=&id=9_0dAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9_0dAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "MvhOgjNUeTMC", "etag": "E4T9eOo52b4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MvhOgjNUeTMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Dovey Coe", "authors": ["Frances O'Roark Dowell"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2000-05-01", "description": "When accused of murder in her North Carolina mountain town in 1928, Dovey Coe, a stronged-willed twelve-year-old girl, comes to a new understanding of others, including her deaf brother.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780689831744"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0689831749"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 181, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 10, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MvhOgjNUeTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MvhOgjNUeTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MvhOgjNUeTMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MvhOgjNUeTMC&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dovey_Coe.html?hl=&id=MvhOgjNUeTMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MvhOgjNUeTMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ah9C4VhkCdoC", "etag": "u5W+Icg8RPA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ah9C4VhkCdoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The First Waco Horror", "subtitle": "The Lynching of Jesse Washington and the Rise of the NAACP", "authors": ["Patricia Bernstein"], "publisher": "Texas A&M University Press", "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "In 1916, in front of a crowd of ten to fifteen thousand cheering spectators watched as seventeen-year-old Jesse Washington, a retarded black boy, was publicly tortured, lynched, and burned on the town square of Waco, Texas. He had been accused and convicted in a kangaroo court for the rape and murder of a white woman. The city's mayor and police chief watched Washington's torture and murder and did nothing. Nearby, a professional photographer took pictures to sell as mementos of that day. The stark story and gory pictures were soon printed in The Crisis, the monthly magazine of the fledgling NAACP, as part of that organization's campaign for antilynching legislation. Even in the vast bloodbath of lynchings that washed across the South and Midwest during the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Waco lynching stood out. The NAACP assigned a young white woman, Elisabeth Freeman, to travel to Waco to investigate, and report back. The evidence she gathered and gave to W. E. B. Du Bois provided grist for the efforts of the NAACP to raise national consciousness of the atrocities being committed and to raise funds to lobby antilynching legislation as well. In the summer of 1916, three disparate forces - a vibrant, growing city bursting with optimism on the blackland prairie of Central Texas, a young woman already tempered in the frontline battles for woman's suffrage, and a very small organization of grimly determined \"progressives\" in New York City - collided with each other, with consequences no one could have foreseen. They were brought together irrevocably by the prolonged torture and public murder of Jesse Washington - the atrocity that became known as the Waco Horror. Drawing on extensive research in the national files of the NAACP, local newspapers and archives, and interviews with the descendants of participants in the events of that day, Patricia Bernstein has reconstructed the details of not only the crime but also its aftermath. She has charted the ways the story affected the development of the NAACP and especially the eventual success of its antilynching campaign. She searches for answers to the questions of how participating in such violence affected the lives of the mob leaders, the city officials who stood by passively, and the community that found itself capable of such abject behavior.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603445474"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603445471"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 265, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ah9C4VhkCdoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ah9C4VhkCdoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ah9C4VhkCdoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ah9C4VhkCdoC&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_First_Waco_Horror.html?hl=&id=ah9C4VhkCdoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_First_Waco_Horror-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ah9C4VhkCdoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ah9C4VhkCdoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "jXumAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "SZhKt7dic8M", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jXumAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Present Darkness", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["Malla Nunn"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03", "description": "A tale set in the harsh world of apartheid South Africa finds Detective Emmanuel Cooper cancelling his holiday plans to learn the truth about his best friend's wrongful murder charge by a high-profile white teen, a case that pits him against violent gangs and corrupt government officials.

abusive husband, Andrew, with a .32 caliber revolver in the Gogebic Hotel. She phoned Andy Anderson and asked him to help her dispose of the body. Andy drove the back roads until he came to a field and threw Sigler's body across a ditch on the side of the road. Then he left town for a week. When he returned to Hurley, he was arrested for killing Sigler. After being jailed, he bragged to an undercover private detective that he killed Sigler. Andy was sentenced to life imprisonment at the state penitentiary. Emma was arrested as an accessory and was locked up in the county jail for six months until her trial. Shortly before her trial, Emma confessed to murdering her husband in self defense, but she was convicted and received a life sentence in the state penitentiary, and her four children were sent to an orphanage. When she arrived at the prison, it was discovered that Emma was pregnant. After more than 80 years, the circumstances surrounding the murder of Andrew Sigler and the convictions of Andy Anderson and Emma Sigler are being told in this novel based on a crime that had been considered \"solved.\" Glen Carlson, a graduate of the University of Minnesota, has done graduate work at Harvard, and served in both the U.S. Marines and the U.S. Army. He and his wife live in Michigan's Upper Peninsula snowbelt with their dog, Buddy; their cat, Sophie; and their large and powerful snow-blower, Brutus.

The inquest testimony of the physicians who attended her death in Hawaii led to a coroner\u0092s jury verdict of murder\u0097by strychnine poisoning. Stanford University President David Starr Jordan promptly issued a press release claiming that Mrs. Stanford had died of heart disease, a claim that he supported by challenging the skills and judgment of the Honolulu physicians and toxicologist. Jordan\u0092s diagnosis was largely accepted and promulgated in many subsequent historical accounts. In this book, the author reviews the medical reports in detail to refute Dr. Jordan\u0092s claim and to show that Mrs. Stanford indeed died of strychnine poisoning. His research reveals that the professionals who were denounced by Dr. Jordan enjoyed honorable and distinguished careers. He concludes that Dr. Jordan went to great lengths, over a period of nearly two decades, to cover up the real circumstances of Mrs. Stanford\u0092s death.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0804747938"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780804747936"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 161, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2tRNXXjG9kEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2tRNXXjG9kEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2tRNXXjG9kEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2tRNXXjG9kEC&dq=subject:Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mysterious_Death_of_Jane_Stanford.html?hl=&id=2tRNXXjG9kEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Mysterious_Death_of_Jane_Stanford-sample-epub.acsm?id=2tRNXXjG9kEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2tRNXXjG9kEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "yRFqwKcrkY4C", "etag": "+DMS+pl9Fzo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yRFqwKcrkY4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Serpent Gate", "authors": ["Michael McGarrity"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2012-11-20", "description": "Assigned to lead the investigation of a multi-million-dollar art theft from New Mexico's state capitol building, Santa Fe policeman Kevin Kerney finds himself face to face with an old enemy with ties to the Mexican government. 35,000 first printing.

An important chapter in that undeclared conflict played out in northeast Texas, in the Corners region where Grayson, Fannin, Hunt, and Collin Counties converged. Part of that violence came to be called the Lee-Peacock Feud, a struggle in which Unionists led by Lewis Peacock and former Confederates led by Bob Lee sought to even old scores, as well as to set the terms of the new South, especially regarding the status of freed slaves. Until recently, the Lee-Peacock violence has been placed squarely within the Lost Cause mythology. This account sets the record straight. For Bob Lee, a Confederate veteran, the new phase of the war began when he refused to release his slaves. When Federal officials came to his farm in July to enforce emancipation, he fought back and finally fled as a fugitive. In the relatively short time left to his life, he claimed personally to have killed at least forty people\u2014civilian and military, Unionists and freedmen. Peacock, a dedicated leader of the Unionist efforts, became his primary target and chief foe. Both men eventually died at the hands of each other\u2019s supporters. From previously untapped sources in the National Archives and other records, the authors have tracked down the details of the Corners violence and the larger issues it reflected, adding to the reinterpretation of Reconstruction history and rescuing from myth events that shaped the following century of Southern politics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1585442801"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781585442805"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 182, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4ODHqmXDP44C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4ODHqmXDP44C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4ODHqmXDP44C&pg=PA27&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4ODHqmXDP44C&dq=Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Murder_and_Mayhem.html?hl=&id=4ODHqmXDP44C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Murder_and_Mayhem-sample-epub.acsm?id=4ODHqmXDP44C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Murder_and_Mayhem-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4ODHqmXDP44C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4ODHqmXDP44C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "CHAPTER 3 <b>Murder</b> and Mayhem Soon after the Civil War , Unionists in <br>\nNortheast Texas convened a meeting in Paris , Lamar County , guided by B .

Mavens, the lead police detective, has always been hostile toward her. Marty, Nora's unfaithful and soon to be ex-husband, was promoted over her, many say unfairly, to C.O. of Homicide. Mavens and Marty's prime suspect is the victim's wife. She hires Nora to investigate, and Nora jumps at the chance to prove herself the better man, so to speak. Everyone has a motive-the brother who wants a bigger part of the family business, the ex-wife and former screen star whose income can't support her lifestyle, the drug addicted son who may not actually be the victim's son, the mistress who is all sexuality and ruthless ambition. Or could Mavens and Marty be right?

In Murder by Accident, Jody Enders boldly resurrects the long-disgraced concept of intentionality, especially as it relates to the theater. Drawing on four fascinating medieval events in which a theatrical performance precipitated deadly consequences, Enders contends that the marginalization of intention in critical discourse is a mirror for the marginalization\u2014and misunderstanding\u2014of theater. Murder by Accident revisits the legal, moral, ethical, and aesthetic limits of the living arts of the past, pairing them with examples from the present, whether they be reality television, snuff films, the \u201caccidental\u201d live broadcast of a suicide on a Los Angeles freeway, or an actor who jokingly fired a stage revolver at his temple, causing his eventual death.

As a reporter for the Pennysaver, Lucy is assigned a puff piece on upscale Chanticleer's Chocolates, and its deliciously handsome owner, Trey Meacham. Soon Lucy discovers there's another tantalizing tart behind the counter. Sultry store manager Tamzin Graves is only too eager to serve her male customers. Leaving a throng of jealous women in her wake, it's almost no surprise when Tamzin turns up dead, her body covered in chocolate. . . Could a bitter ex-wife be behind the crimes? Or a candy shop competitor?

Legal scholars almost unanimously condemn it as irrational, concluding that it imposes punishment without fault and presumes guilt without proof. Despite this, the law persists in almost every U.S. jurisdiction. Felony Murder is the first book on this controversial legal doctrine. It shows that felony murder liability rests on a simple and powerful idea: that the guilt incurred in attacking or endangering others depends on one's reasons for doing so. Inflicting harm is wrong, and doing so for a bad motive\u2014such as robbery, rape, or arson\u2014aggravates that wrong. In presenting this idea, Guyora Binder criticizes prevailing academic theories of criminal intent for trying to purge criminal law of moral judgment. Ultimately, Binder shows that felony murder law has been and should remain limited by its justifying aims.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780804781701"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0804781702"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.5.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_KHNXJg47b8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_KHNXJg47b8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_KHNXJg47b8C&pg=PA15&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=59&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_KHNXJg47b8C&dq=Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Felony_Murder.html?hl=&id=_KHNXJg47b8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Felony_Murder-sample-epub.acsm?id=_KHNXJg47b8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Felony_Murder-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_KHNXJg47b8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_KHNXJg47b8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This widely believed account of the origins of felony <b>murder</b> liability undermines <br>\nits legitimacy in two ways.

With so much on her plate, Hannah Swensen can hardly find the time to think about her bakery--let alone the town's most recent murder. . Hannah is nervous about the upcoming trial for her involvement in a tragic accident.

Since the crime and the punishment come as a 'package deal' this book looks at both the legal nature of the offence and at the current operation of the mandatory life sentence. Not only does the book adopt a critical approach, by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo, it also draws upon comparative material from both common and civil law jurisdictions in an attempt to provide a comprehensive exploration of these issues. The need for public confidence in the criminal justice system is particularly acute in the way it deals with the most serious homicides. In this book the authors report findings from the first systematic exploration of public attitudes to sentencing murder in this or any other common law jurisdiction. The picture of public opinion emerging from this recent large-scale nationwide qualitative and quantitative survey, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, is likely to surprise many, and will be of interest to all jurisdictions where the mandatory life sentence for murder has been questioned.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781782250265"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1782250263"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 196, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT66&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3535, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3535, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-d2J6BAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3535000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3535000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Exploring_the_Mandatory_Life_Sentence_fo-sample-epub.acsm?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Exploring_the_Mandatory_Life_Sentence_fo-sample-pdf.acsm?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=d2J6BAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In our study we were interested in two related domains: public knowledge of <br>\n<b>murder</b> trends in Britain, and public awareness of punishment of persons <br>\nconvicted of <b>murder</b>.

Charlie Parker and her husband Drake Langston accept a job with Gold Trail Adventures in Skagway, Alaska, flying visitors by helicopter to remote cabin sites to experience the outdoor lifestyle and seek their fortunes. It isn\u2019t long before one of the guests finds a set of bones in an old mine, remains that date back decades. His hands full with present-day cases, police chief Sam Branson tells Charlie and her new reporter friend, Mina Gengler, that they are free to investigate. A second body is found, bringing up a lot of questions. Charlie gets a peek into the lives and times of Gold Rush-era Alaskans when she discovers a box of old letters written by one of the stampeders and begins to wonder if it's possible that the two bodies are connected.

Price"], "publisher": "University of Arizona Press", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "In November of 1977, Terry Lee Farmer, a white inmate at Arizona State Prison in Florence, walked up to black prisoner Waymond Small in front of sixty witnesses and stabbed him in the heart with a shank. Small had agreed to testify before the state legislature about gang violence inside Arizona State Prison and was murdered the day before his scheduled appearance. This murder proved the catalyst for an all-out war between the State of Arizona and the Aryan Brotherhood. Through five trials, Farmer claimed self-defense and the jurors acquitted all ten of his co-conspirators. Thornton Price, one of the defense attorneys, now tells how Farmer and Small became cannon fodder in this war to reclaim Arizona\u00d5s prisons from rival gangs. These gangs\u00d1the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mau Maus, and the Mexican Mafia\u00d1were suspected of committing more than a dozen murders over the previous two years, motivating politicians to crack down after the violence could no longer be ignored or contained. To reconstruct the case, Price reviewed 16,000 pages of court records and conducted interviews with key participants to piece together an insider\u00d5s account of the crime and the politics behind its investigation. Prison murders should be easy to solve, but investigators quickly learned that the convicts\u00d5 code of silence makes these cases often impossible to win in court. Price focuses on the special problems posed by prison crime by getting inside the skins of men like murderer Terry \"Crazy\" Farmer and William \"Red Dog\" Howard, one of the Florence Eleven and a founder of the Aryan Brotherhood. He also presents the perspectives of state investigators and reveals how they calculated to pit black witnesses against white killers until one black would break the code of silence and provoke feuding within the Brotherhood. Murder Unpunished tells how society\u00d5s most outrageous criminals ran the prison through gang violence as outside the walls Arizona struggled to outgrow its Wild West past. Like few other books, it reveals how prisons incubate predatory criminals and gangs, and it exposes the unique difficulties of prosecuting prison crimes.

In her analysis of literary and cultural representations of this phenomenon across genres, Bridget Walsh traces how the perception of the domestic murderer changed across the nineteenth century and suggests ways in which the public appetite for such crimes was representative of wider social concerns. She argues that the portrayal of domestic murder did not signal a consensus of opinion regarding the domestic space, but rather reflected significant discontent with the cultural and social codes of behaviour circulating in society, particularly around issues of gender and class. Examining novels, trial transcripts, medico-legal documents, broadsides, criminal and scientific writing, illustration and, notably, Victorian melodrama, Walsh focuses on the relationship between the domestic sphere, so central to Victorian values, and the desecration of that space by the act of murder. Her book encompasses the gendered representation of domestic murder for both men and women as it tackles crucial questions related to Victorian ideas of nationhood, national health, political and social inequality, newspaper coverage of murder, unstable and contested models of masculinity and the ambivalent portrayal of the female domestic murderer at the fin de si\u00e8cle.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472421050"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472421051"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 194, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-VWmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-VWmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-VWmAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA39&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=94&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-VWmAwAAQBAJ&dq=Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Domestic_Murder_in_Nineteenth_Century_En.html?hl=&id=-VWmAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Domestic_Murder_in_Nineteenth_Century_En-sample-epub.acsm?id=-VWmAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-VWmAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "chapter 2 &#39;the theatre of his Deep Dyed guilt&#39;: Domestic <b>murder</b> and the Victorian <br>\nstage it is almost impossible to separate the melodrama of crime from domestic <br>\nmelodrama generally; one can only say that the sensational element in crime&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "yfrqRiM1UJ0C", "etag": "DGHxigX6sMo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yfrqRiM1UJ0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Murder of a Chocolate-Covered Cherry", "subtitle": "A Scumble River Mystery", "authors": ["Denise Swanson"], "publisher": "Penguin", "publishedDate": "2008-04-01", "description": "Grandma Sal's Soup-To-Nuts Cooking Challenge is coming to town, and Skye Denison is entering.

De Quincey's response to Williams's attacks turns morality on its head, celebrating and coolly dissecting the art of murder and its perfections. Ranging from gruesomely vivid reportage and brilliantly funny satiric high jinks to penetrating literary and aesthetic criticism, the essays had a remarkable impact on crime, terror, and detective fiction, as well as on the rise of nineteenth-century decadence.

Shuy"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01", "description": "The Language of Murder Cases describes fifteen court cases for which Roger W. Shuy served as an expert language witness. Investigations and trials in murder cases are guided by the important legal terms describing the mental states of defendants: intentionality, predisposition, and voluntariness. Unfortunately, statutes and dictionaries can provide only loose definitions, largely because mental states are virtually impossible to define. The meaning of these terms, therefore, must be adduced either by inferences and assumptions, or by any available language evidence-often the best window into a speaker's mind. Fortunately, this window of evidence exists primarily in electronically recorded undercover conversations, police interviews, and legal hearings and trials, all of which are subject to linguistic analysis before and during trial. In this book, Shuy explains how vague legal terminology can be clarified by analysis of the language used by suspects, defendants, law enforcement officers, and attorneys. He examines speech events, schemas, agendas, speech acts, conversational strategies, as well as smaller language units such as syntax, lexicon, and phonology, and discusses how these can play a major role in deciding murder cases. In his analysis, Shuy draws on his personal experience testifying at fifteen fascinating murder trials, focusing on the role that language played in each. He concludes with a summary of how his analyses were regarded by the juries as they struggled with the equally vague concept of reasonable doubt.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190203221"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190203226"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1821.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1821.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1ib-AgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1821740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1821740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Language_of_Murder_Cases-sample-pdf.acsm?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1ib-AgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Murther most foul Macbeth, Act I Scene 5 The earliest records of the use of the <br>\nAnglo-Saxon word <b>murder</b> (with its variants myrthrian, murthre, murther, and <br>\nmorthur) designated pretty much what the act means today, except for a time <br>\nduring the&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Qta2ZMQDH2oC", "etag": "VweWe/ZMnes", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Qta2ZMQDH2oC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "True Murder Stories", "authors": ["Nischal N Hegde"], "publisher": "Nischal Hegde", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781105629181"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "110562918X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qta2ZMQDH2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qta2ZMQDH2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Qta2ZMQDH2oC&pg=PT81&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=98&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Qta2ZMQDH2oC&dq=Murder&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/True_Murder_Stories.html?hl=&id=Qta2ZMQDH2oC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Qta2ZMQDH2oC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Three days later, a new Homicide Act came into effect; <b>murder</b> by poison became <br>\na non-capital offence.

How has it changed over time? And what causes a person to commit multiple murders in a matter of hours or even minutes? This book explores these questions by examining 909 mass murders that took place in the United States between 1900 and 1999. By far the largest study on the topic to date, it begins with a look at the patterns and prevalence of mass murders by presenting rates from 1900\u20131999 and by describing the characteristics of mass killers. Placing the phenomenon within the broader social, political, and economic context of the twentieth century, the work examines the factors that have influenced trends in the prevalence of mass murder. It also discusses more than 100 case studies within three distinct periods of mass murder activity (1900\u20131939, 1940\u20131965, and 1966\u20131999) to illustrate more clearly the motives of mass murderers and the circumstances surrounding their crimes. The final chapters take a look at media coverage and the role it has played in the social construction of mass murder.

Bloody Murder is the first full-length critical study of this pervasive theme of murder in children\u2019s literature. Through rereadings of well-known works, such as Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, and The Outsiders, Michelle Ann Abate explores how acts of homicide connect these works with an array of previously unforeseen literary, social, political, and cultural issues. Topics range from changes in the America criminal justice system, the rise of forensic science, and shifting attitudes about crime and punishment to changing cultural conceptions about the nature of evil and the different ways that murder has been popularly presented and socially interpreted. Bloody Murder adds to the body of inquiry into America's ongoing fascination with violent crime. Abate argues that when narratives for children are considered along with other representations of homicide in the United States, they not only provide a more accurate portrait of the range, depth, and variety of crime literature, they also alter existing ideas about the meaning of violence, the emotional appeal of fear, and the cultural construction of death and dying. -- Adrienne Ester Kertzer, University of Calgary", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781421408415"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1421408414"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 280, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_y-405jtEJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_y-405jtEJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_y-405jtEJgC&pg=PT19&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_y-405jtEJgC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_y-405jtEJgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4844.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4844.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_y-405jtEJgC&rdid=book-_y-405jtEJgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4844220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4844220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bloody_Murder-sample-epub.acsm?id=_y-405jtEJgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bloody_Murder-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_y-405jtEJgC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_y-405jtEJgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Murder</b> is especially endemic to the comparatively new genre of young adult (YA) <br>\nfiction.

This multidisciplinary group was convened on the initiative of Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC and Professor Terence Morris; and was initially chaired by the late Very Reverend Colin Slee, Dean of Southwark and now by Sir Louis. In essence, the group is concerned with promoting a just law of murder. As part of this aim and in view of developments in Parliament in late-2011 and continuing into 2012 concerning sentencing and the use of mandatory sentences in particular, HomRAG has published its first report for consideration by law-makers and other interested parties. Harking back to the abolition of capital punishment, the group argue that the mandatory life sentence for murder is both unjust and outdated; a compromise arrived at in the 1960s in order to ensure that abolition of the death penalty made its way through both Houses of Parliament. Neither it nor the present system of tariff-setting allow for sentences which match the seriousness of individual crimes, so that, e.g. a single 'mercy killing' attracts the same penalty as that for a murder which is part of a course of serial killings.

It tells the shocking story of hatred, revenge, mass murder, terrorism, and a bizarre dynamite bomb Christmas gift that brought a plane down in the Colorado sky more than half a century ago, killing all forty-four passengers and crew, and the intense investigation that resulted in bringing the killer to justice. On November 1, 1955, United Air Lines Flight 629 took off from Denver, Colorado's Stapleton Airfield en route to Portland, Oregon. Eleven minutes into the flight, there was a tremendous explosion that ended the lives of everyone aboard the ill-fated airliner. A coordinated effort between law enforcement agencies, Civil Aeronautics Board investigators, and United Air Lines officials led to identifying the killer as Jack Graham, whose very own mother was aboard the plane and targeted to die. The truth is certainly far more frightening than fiction as this tale will attest to... Bonus material includes a complete tale on British serial killers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley by R.

Throughout the decades of bloodshed, paramilitary leaders on both sides of the political divide continued to search for more so-called legitimate targets. Milestones in Murder charts how more and more innocent people were unwittingly drawn into the conflict against their will. It examines the killings which marked new lows in the republican/loyalist terror war, from the bombing of pubs and clubs to the advent of 'human bomb' couriers. It revisits the horrific murders of the Shankhill Butchers, exclusively revealing exactly who leader Lennie Murphy's accomplices were. This, amongst other revelations, will piece together several parts of the Irish warfare jigsaw for the first time. The book also covers the more recent murder of the author's colleague Martin O'Hagan, an act which sent shock waves through a battle-hardened media in Northern Ireland. O'Hagan was the first journalist in Ireland to lose his life at the hands of the paramilitaries and his death pushed the parameters of slaughter to new limits.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781780573748"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "178057374X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.6.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC&pg=PT63&dq=Murder&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 500.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 250.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC&rdid=book-ABa_ElDm_GUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 500320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 250160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Milestones_in_Murder-sample-epub.acsm?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ABa_ElDm_GUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "To this day, even the mention of the notorious loyalist <b>murder</b> gang &#39;The Shankill <br>\nButchers&#39; strikes fear into the hearts of many Catholics.
