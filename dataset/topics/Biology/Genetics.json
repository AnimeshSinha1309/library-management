The first paper on this single-cell gel electrophoresis assay was published in 1984 by O. Ostling and K.J. Johanson (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. Vol.123: 291-298). The comet assay is a versatile and sensitive method for measuring single - and double-strand breaks in DNA. By including lesion-specific enzymes in the assay, its range and sensitivity are greatly increased, but it is important to bear in mind that their specificity is not absolute. The comet assay (with and without inclusion of lesion-specific enzymes) is widely used as a biomarker assay in human population studies - primarily to measure DNA damage, but increasingly also to assess the capacity of cells for DNA repair. Ostling and Johanson (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1984) were also the first to report experiments to measure DNA repair, by simply following the decrease of DNA damage over time after challenging cells with ionising radiation. However, this approach is time-consuming and laborious as it requires an extended period of cell culture and is therefore not ideal for biomonitoring studies, which typically require high-throughput processing of many samples. As an alternative approach, the in vitro comet-based repair assay was developed: a cell extract is incubated with a DNA substrate containing specific lesions, and DNA incisions accumulate. The in vitro comet-based repair assay has been modified and improved over the past decade: it was first devised to measure base excision repair of oxidised purines in lymphocytes (Collins et al., Mutagenesis, 2001), but has since been adapted for other lesions and thus other repair pathways, as well as being applied to tissue samples in addition to cell suspensions. Even after 30 years, the comet assay is still in a growth phase, with many new users each year. Many questions are repeatedly raised, which may seem to have self-evident answers, but clearly, it is necessary to reiterate them for the benefit of the new audience, and sometimes being forced to think again about old topics can shed new light. Different applications of the comet assay are discussed in this special issue, including: genotoxicity testing in different organisms, human biomonitoring, DNA repair studies, environmental biomonitoring and clinical studies. Furthermore, we consider and where possible answer questions, including the ones raised by Raymond Tice at the 8th International Comet Assay Workshop in Perugia (Italy 2009): What is the spectrum of DNA damage detected by the various versions of the comet assay?; What are the limitations associated with each application?; What should be done to standardize the assay for biomonitoring studies?; Can the comet assay be used to monitor changes in global methylation status?; What cell types are suitable for detecting genotoxic substances and their effects in vivo and in vitro?; Can the assay be fully automated?; and more. So this \u2018Frontiers in Genetics\u2019 research topic is written for the beginner as well as for the experienced users of the comet assay.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889196494"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889196496"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/30_years_of_the_Comet_Assay_an_overview.html?hl=&id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yUwgCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KkYgKe7Mj8kC", "etag": "rerN/NdjDN8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KkYgKe7Mj8kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Classical Genetic Research and Its Legacy", "subtitle": "The Mapping Cultures of Twentieth-century Genetics", "authors": ["Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger", "Jean-Paul Gaudilli\u00e8re"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "With the rise of genomics, the life sciences have entered a new era.

It demonstrates that the development of mapping technologies has accompanied the rise of modern genetics from its very beginnings. In Section One, Mendelian genetics is set in perspective from the viewpoint of the detection and description of linkage phenomena. Section Two addresses the role of mapping for the experimental working practice of classical geneticists, their social interactions and for the laboratory 'life worlds'. With detailed analyses of the scientific practices of mapping and its illustration of the diversity of mapping practices this book is a significant contibution to the history of genetics.

However, most GAs employed in practice nowadays are unable to learn genetic linkage and suffer from the linkage problem. The linkage learning genetic algorithm (LLGA) was proposed to tackle the linkage problem with several specially designed mechanisms. While the LLGA performs much better on badly scaled problems than simple GAs, it does not work well on uniformly scaled problems as other competent GAs. Therefore, we need to understand why it is so and need to know how to design a better LLGA or whether there are certain limits of such a linkage learning process. This book aims to gain better understanding of the LLGA in theory and to improve the LLGA's performance in practice. It starts with a survey of the existing genetic linkage learning techniques and describes the steps and approaches taken to tackle the research topics, including using promoters, developing the convergence time model, and adopting subchromosomes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540284591"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540284598"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 120, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea.html?hl=&id=kKr3rKhPU7oC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea-sample-epub.acsm?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea-sample-pdf.acsm?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "yXFfPkLq4yEC", "etag": "4X3YAnBXXO4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yXFfPkLq4yEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lewin's GENES XI", "authors": ["Jocelyn E.

Despite its enormous potential, bioinformatics is not widely integrated into the academic curriculum as most life science students and researchers are still not equipped with the necessary knowledge to take advantage of this powerful tool. Hence, the primary purpose of our book is to supplement this unmet need by providing an easily accessible platform for students and researchers starting their career in life sciences. This book aims to avoid sophisticated computational algorithms and programming. Instead, it mostly focuses on simple DIY analysis and interpretation of biological data with personal computers. Our belief is that once the beginners acquire these basic skillsets, they will be able to handle most of the bioinformatics tools for their research work and to better understand their experimental outcomes. Unlike other bioinformatics books which are mostly theoretical, this book provides practical examples for the readers on state-of-the-art open source tools to solve biological problems.

Non-target species, agricultural diversity and the rights of small farmers are also coming under threat. Stephen Nottingham argues that much more precaution is required when releasing GMOs into the environment.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1842770373"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781842770375"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 211, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=36FZ7GSkhqoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=36FZ7GSkhqoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=36FZ7GSkhqoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=36FZ7GSkhqoC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Genescapes.html?hl=&id=36FZ7GSkhqoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=36FZ7GSkhqoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "F8dLsppNtQwC", "etag": "JLpVbjDvc2w", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/F8dLsppNtQwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Reframing Rights", "subtitle": "Bioconstitutionalism in the Genetic Age", "authors": ["Sheila Jasanoff"], "publisher": "MIT Press", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "Legal texts have been with us since the dawn of human history. Beginning in 1953, life too became textual. The discovery of the structure of DNA made it possible to represent the basic matter of life with permutations and combinations of four letters of the alphabet, A, T, C, and G. Since then, the biological and legal conceptions of life have been in constant, mutually constitutive interplay--the former focusing on life's definition, the latter on life's entitlements. Reframing Rights argues that this period of transformative change in law and the life sciences should be considered \"bioconstitutional.\"Reframing Rights explores the evolving relationship of biology, biotechnology, and law through a series of national and cross-national case studies. Sheila Jasanoff maps out the conceptual territory in a substantive editorial introduction, after which the contributors offer \"snapshots\" of developments at the frontiers of biotechnology and the law. Chapters examine such topics as national cloning and xenotransplant policies; the politics of stem cell research in Britain, Germany, and Italy; DNA profiling and DNA databases in criminal law; clinical trials in India and the United States; the GM crop controversy in Britain; and precautionary policymaking in the European Union.

Four primary sections--Genetic and Culture Methods, Neurobiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and Genomics and Informatics--reflect the cross-disciplinary nature of C. elegans research. Because C. elegans is a simple and malleable organism with a small genome and few cell types, it provides an elegant demonstration of functions fundamental to multicellular organisms. The discipline has greatly expanded as researchers continue to find this small soil nematode to be the model of choice for studying specific pathways, stages of development, and cell types. By directing its audience not just to tried-and-true recipes for research, but also to databases and other innovative sources of information, this comprehensive collection is intended to guide investigators of C. elegans for years to come. First single-source book detailing explanations of current and classic C. elegans methodologies Diversity and scope of techniques covered expected to be useful to the broadening community of C. elegans researchers for years to come Techniques range from reverse genetics and mutagenesis, to laser ablation and electrophysiology, to in situ hybridization and DNA sequencing methods Appendices include resource information important to the C. elegans community, including the C. elegans Genetics Center and Internet resources like the Worm Community System and ACeDB Illustrated with more than 100 tables and figures", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780125641494"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0125641494"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 659, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.4.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Caenorhabditis_Elegans.html?hl=&id=AUxd_e4mzHIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Caenorhabditis_Elegans-sample-pdf.acsm?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AUxd_e4mzHIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EDViIysU0uEC", "etag": "yk6IYJg7mLc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EDViIysU0uEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Extended Phenotype", "subtitle": "The Long Reach of the Gene", "authors": ["Richard Dawkins", "Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science Richard Dawkins", "Daniel Clement Dennett"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "publishedDate": "1999", "description": "In this influential and controversial book that has become a classic in popular science writing, Dawkins furthers his fascinating look at the evolution of life and natural selection.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0192880519"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780192880512"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 313, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EDViIysU0uEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EDViIysU0uEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EDViIysU0uEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EDViIysU0uEC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Extended_Phenotype.html?hl=&id=EDViIysU0uEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EDViIysU0uEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "X1Gqw68gcpIC", "etag": "Wp+tuXOVzpM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/X1Gqw68gcpIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Quantitative Trait Loci", "subtitle": "Methods and Protocols", "authors": ["Nicola J.

For instance, Bayesian networks and Markov random fields are two of the most popular probabilistic graphical models. With the rapid advance of high-throughput technologies and their ever decreasing costs, a fast-growing volume of biological data of various types - the so-called ''omics'' - is in need of accurate andefficient methods for modeling, prior to further downstream analysis. As probabilistic graphical models are able to deal with high-dimensional data, it is foreseeable that such models will have aprominent role to play in advances in genome-wide data analyses. Currently, few people are specialists in the design of cutting-edge methods using probabilistic graphical models for genetics, genomics and postgenomics. This seriously hinders the diffusion of such methods. The prime aim of the book is therefore to bring the concepts underlying these advanced models within reach of scientists who are not specialists of these models, but with no concession on theinformativeness of the book. The target readers include researchers and engineers who have to design novel methods for postgenomics data analysis, as well as graduate students starting a Masters or a PhD. Inaddition to an introductory chapter on probabilistic graphical models, a thorough review chapter focusing on selected domains in genetics and fourteen chapters illustrate the design of such advanced approaches in various domains: gene network inference, inference of causal phenotype networks, association genetics, epigenetics, detection of copy number variations, and prediction of outcomes from high-dimensional genomic data. Notably, most examples also illustrate that probabilistic graphicalmodels are well suited for integrative biology and systems biology, hot topics guaranteed to be of lasting interest.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780198709022"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0198709021"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 449, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Mathematics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_for_Genet.html?hl=&id=2URhBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2URhBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "W5nhDAAAQBAJ", "etag": "HCMddzdU6Gk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/W5nhDAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Social Life of DNA", "subtitle": "Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation After the Genome", "authors": ["Alondra Nelson"], "publisher": "Beacon Press", "publishedDate": "2016", "description": "The unexpected story of how genetic testing is affecting race in America We know DNA is a master key that unlocks medical and forensic secrets, but its genealogical life is both revelatory and endlessly fascinating. Tracing genealogy is now the second-most popular hobby amongst Americans, as well as the second-most visited online category. This billion-dollar industry has spawned popular television shows, websites, and Internet communities, and a booming heritage tourism circuit. The tsunami of interest in genetic ancestry tracing from the African American community has been especially overwhelming. In The Social Life of DNA, Alondra Nelson takes us on an unprecedented journey into how the double helix has wound its way into the heart of the most urgent contemporary social issues around race. For over a decade, Nelson has deeply studied this phenomenon. Artfully weaving together keenly observed interactions with root-seekers alongside illuminating historical details and revealing personal narrative, she shows that genetic genealogy is a new tool for addressing old and enduring issues. In The Social Life of DNA, she explains how these cutting-edge DNA-based techniques are being used in myriad ways, including grappling with the unfinished business of slavery: to foster reconciliation, to establish ties with African ancestral homelands, to rethink and sometimes alter citizenship, and to make legal claims for slavery reparations specifically based on ancestry. Nelson incisively shows that DNA is a portal to the past that yields insight for the present and future, shining a light on social traumas and historical injustices that still resonate today. Science can be a crucial ally to activism to spur social change and transform twenty-first-century racial politics. But Nelson warns her readers to be discerning: for the social repair we seek can't be found in even the most sophisticated science. Engrossing and highly original, The Social Life of DNA is a must-read for anyone interested in race, science, history and how our reckoning with the past may help us to chart a more just course for tomorrow.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780807027189"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0807027189"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 200, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["African Americans"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 14, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Life_of_DNA.html?hl=&id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=W5nhDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "y60oDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "9GVM9l0XhLw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/y60oDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Jews and Genes", "subtitle": "The Genetic Future in Contemporary Jewish Thought", "authors": ["Elliot N.

Genetics: Genes, Genomes, and Evolution presents the fundamental principles of genetics and molecular biology from an evolutionary perspective as informed by genome analysis. By using what has been learned from the analyses of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes as its basis, the book unites evolution, genomics, and genetics in one narrative approach. Genomic analysis is inherently both molecular and evolutionary, and every chapter is approached from this unified perspective. Similarly, genomic studies have provided a deeper appreciation of the profound relationships between all organisms - something reflected in the book's integrated discussion of bacterial and eukaryotic evolution, genetics and genomics. It is an approach that provides students with a uniquely flexible and contemporary view of genetics, genomics, and evolution.

How do some genes control the expression of others? How do genes interact to form gene networks? With its unique integration of genetics and molecular biology, Genetic Analysis probes fascinating questions such as these, detailing how our understanding of key genetic phenomena can be used to understand biological systems. Opening with a brief overview of key genetic principles, model organisms, and epigenetics, the book goes on to explorethe use of gene mutations and the analysis of gene expression and activity. A discussion of the genetic structure of natural populations follows, before the interaction of genes during suppression and epistasis, how we study gene networks, and personalized genomics are considered. Drawing on the latest experimental tools, including microarrays, RNAi screens, and bioinformatics approaches, Genetic Analysis provides a state-of-the-art review of the field, but in a truly student-friendly manner. It uses extended case studies and text boxes to augment the narrative, taking the reader right to the forefront of contemporary research, without losing clarity of explanation and insight. We are in an age where, despite knowing so much about biological systems, we are just beginning to realise how much more there is still to understand. Genetic Analysis is the ideal guide to how we can use the awesome power of molecular genetics to further our understanding. Online Resource Centre: The Online Resource Centre to accompany Genetic Analysis features the following resources for teachers and students: For students: * Topical updates - key updates on topics or tools presented in the book, to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. * Additional case studies and text boxes to complement and add to those found in the book. * Practice problems, to test the reader's knowledge of the concepts presented, and help to master them.

In recent decades the flourishing of developmental biology, genomics, epigenetics and our increased understanding of neuronal plasticity have all helped to subvert such dichotomous notions. Nevertheless, the media still report the discovery of a gene 'for' this or that behaviour, and the field of behavioural genetics continues to extend its reach into the social sciences, reporting the heritability of such human traits as religiosity and political affiliation. There are many continuing challenges to notions of human freedom and moral responsibility, with consequent implications for social flourishing, the legal system and religious beliefs. In this book, Denis Alexander critically examines these challenges, concluding that genuine free will, often influenced by genetic variation, emerges from an integrated view of human personhood derived from contemporary biology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781107141148"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1107141141"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 376, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Religion"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Genes_Determinism_and_God.html?hl=&id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=i9QoDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "akd4PdQZQyUC", "etag": "vD5J7WyrqpU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/akd4PdQZQyUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Race and the Genetic Revolution", "subtitle": "Science, Myth, and Culture", "authors": ["Sheldon Krimsky", "Kathleen Sloan"], "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "\"A project of the Council for Responsible Genetics.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231156974"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231156979"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 296, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Race_and_the_Genetic_Revolution.html?hl=&id=akd4PdQZQyUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=akd4PdQZQyUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "7CEmKh5S0SUC", "etag": "SFXibcnyO70", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7CEmKh5S0SUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Y", "subtitle": "The Descent of Men", "authors": ["Steve Jones"], "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "In his highly entertaining and enlightening book, the acclaimed geneticist and author Steve Jones offers a landmark exploration of maleness.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), generally including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have recently been found to have potential roles in these diseases, and provide new opportunities for developing both specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, the molecular function and regulation of these RNAs still remains challenging. Numerous studies are focusing on this field in order to fully appreciate the role and regulation of these molecules in human medicine and biology. This e-book aims to bring together new findings on Non-coding RNAs in different complex diseases. It will highlight the characterization, roles, mechanism, and mode of action of these RNAs in complex disorders. We believe that the publications on this topic would be exponentially extended in future. The improved approaches at multiple levels may pave the way for designing and applying new biomarker and therapeutic targets for specific diseases based on these attractive molecules.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889450022"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889450023"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Molecular_Function_and_Regulation_of_Non.html?hl=&id=oNInDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oNInDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vnR6MqBAueIC", "etag": "mDfWJc2GcUI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vnR6MqBAueIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Manual of Medical Laboratory Techniques", "authors": ["S Ramakrishnan", "KN Sulochana"], "publisher": "JP Medical Ltd", "publishedDate": "2012-03-29", "description": "This manual is a complete guide to medical laboratory techniques used in medical microbiology, haematology, clinical biochemistry, histopathology, human genetics and molecular biology.
