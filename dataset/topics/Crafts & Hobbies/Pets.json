Richardson began experimenting with military and police dogs in 1898, and in 1910 began petitioning for a British military dog program. He finally received official approval with support of officers who were unofficially, and successfully, using his dogs in the field. Over 2000 dogs were trained and sent to the front to work as Red Cross dogs, messengers, sentries and patrol dogs--the lives saved were estimated in thousands. Cummins recounts not only Richardson's struggle, but also the history of war dogs through the ages. This book formed the basis for the documentary Dogs of War on the BBC series Inside Out, broadcast in 2006.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781550592481"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1550592483"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 210, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Colonel_Richardson_s_Airedales.html?hl=&id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2dDJAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "RxucBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "YAtYcjsIT68", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RxucBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "K9 Personal Protection", "subtitle": "A Manual for Training Reliable Protection Dogs", "authors": ["Resi Gerritsen", "Ruud Haak"], "publisher": "Dog Training Press", "publishedDate": "2014-12-22", "description": "Create a safe, successful K9 training program that results in reliable protection dogs.

His techniques have worked for hundreds of dogs, and have been used and adapted by many skilled trainers and decoys for their individual circumstances. K9 Aggression Control provides a flexible approach to aggression control that is rooted in obedience training.

It details techniques and variations so you can choose the options you prefer. Dr. Mackenzie also gives decoys sound advice on controlling a dog's excitement level, working with handlers, and making the best use of equipment. A new chapter in this revised and updated edition shows you how to train dogs to indicate a person's location without biting -- essential for the search and rescue trainer and a real plus for modern police forces looking for ways to reduce liability.

Includes resources and a section on pet loss and natural disasters. As society accepts that grieving over the death of a loved one is not only normal, but healthy and necessary, grieving over the loss of a pet is often seen differently. Expressed feelings often go unvalidated when in truth, pet loss is a unique form of grief that can be quite intense and debilitating, increasing an individual's vulnerability to subsequent stress and leaving them feeling isolated and misunderstood. Pet loss needs to be addressed by therapists and others in the helping professions, to better enable them to help their clients through the loss of their companion animals. This unique guide is written for all professionals helping clients deal with the loss of a pet, and serves as a practical introduction to the field of human-animal bonding.

In these pages you\u2019ll also meet Maya and Zuni, two orphaned baby hummingbirds who hatched from eggs the size of navy beans, and who are little more than air bubbles fringed with feathers. Their lives hang precariously in the balance\u2014but with human help, they may one day conquer the sky. Snowball is a cockatoo whose dance video went viral on YouTube and who\u2019s now teaching schoolchildren how to dance. You\u2019ll meet Harris\u2019s hawks named Fire and Smoke. And you\u2019ll come to know and love a host of other avian characters who will change your mind forever about who birds really are. Each of these birds shows a different and utterly surprising aspect of what makes a bird a bird\u2014and these are the lessons of Birdology: that birds are far stranger, more wondrous, and at the same time more like us than we might have dared to imagine. In Birdology, beloved author of The Good Good Pig Sy Montgomery explores the essence of the otherworldly creatures we see every day. By way of her adventures with seven birds\u2014wild, tame, exotic, and common\u2014she weaves new scientific insights and narrative to reveal seven kernels of bird wisdom. The first lesson of Birdology is that, no matter how common they are, Birds Are Individuals, as each of Montgomery\u2019s distinctive Ladies clearly shows. In the leech-infested rain forest of Queensland, you\u2019ll come face to face with a cassowary\u2014a 150-pound, man-tall, flightless bird with a helmet of bone on its head and a slashing razor-like toenail with which it (occasionally) eviscerates people\u2014proof that Birds Are Dinosaurs. You\u2019ll learn from hawks that Birds Are Fierce; from pigeons, how Birds Find Their Way Home; from parrots, what it means that Birds Can Talk; and from 50,000 crows who moved into a small city\u2019s downtown, that Birds Are Everywhere. They are the winged aliens who surround us. Birdology explains just how very \"other\" birds are: Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. They are covered with modified scales, which are called feathers. Their bones are hollow. Their bodies are permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs. Yet despite birds\u2019 and humans\u2019 disparate evolutionary paths, we share emotional and intellectual abilities that allow us to communicate and even form deep bonds. When we begin to comprehend who birds really are, we deepen our capacity to approach, understand, and love these otherworldly creatures. And this, ultimately, is the priceless lesson of Birdology: it communicates a heartfelt fascination and awe for birds and restores our connection to these complex, mysterious fellow creatures.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1416570160"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416570165"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.4.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Birdology.html?hl=&id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Birdology-sample-epub.acsm?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Bs_fdEOSYD4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "zi_bbk9kUNAC", "etag": "e2qOj6lwiaI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zi_bbk9kUNAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Book of the Bitch", "subtitle": "A Complete Guide to Understanding and Caring for Bitches", "authors": ["J.

Crystal healing is as effective and potent a healing art today as it was in the time of the ancient Egyptians. It is even more effective with animals than for humans, and any pet owner or animal caregiver can easily learn to master the basic techniques of choosing and cleansing crystals, dowsing and crystal massage, making crystal essences, and the use of crystal layouts in healing. Crystal Healing for Animals explains these methods in plain and simple language and will be useful for beginners and experienced crystal users alike. Crystal healing allows us to take an active role in the health of our animal companions, in the sure knowledge that we can do no wrong. Crystals have a healing energy that is powerful and profound, but is completely safe and gentle. Take a guided tour of thirty of the most commonly used and effective healing crystal and gemstones, showing how you can easily and inexpensively build up a collection that will last a life time and go on providing healing support to your animal friends as the years go by. Animal problems covered include: abuse and trauma, allergies, bereavement and grief, hyperactivity, constipation, inflammation, low immunity, muscle strains and pains, post-surgical recovery, stress, training problems and animal/human relationships, and much more. This book also contains special sections on training and animal rescue, showing the role that crystals can play in this context.

She wasn't just a friendly mutt who needed a home; she was a talking dog with an active interest in what her new owner did for a living and how it could work for her. Soon Emmy was trying to use the strange ideas of quantum mechanics for the really important things in her life: chasing critters, getting treats, and going for walks. She peppered Chad with questions: Could she use quantum tunneling to get through the neighbor's fence and chase bunnies? What about quantum teleportation to catch squirrels before they climb out of reach? Where are all the universes in which Chad drops steak on the floor? And what about the bunnies made of cheese that ought to be appearing out of nothing in the backyard? With great humor and clarity, Chad Orzel explains to Emmy, and to human readers, just what quantum mechanics is and how it works -- and why, although you can't use it to catch squirrels or eat steak, it's still bizarre, amazing, and important to every dog and human. Follow along as Chad and Emmy discuss the central elements of quantum theory, from particles that behave like waves and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to entanglement (\"spooky action at a distance\") and virtual particles. Along the way, they discuss the history of the theory, such as the experiments that discovered that electrons are waves and particles at the same time, and Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr's decades-long debate over what quantum theory really meant (Einstein may have been smarter, but Bohr was right more often). Don't get caught looking less informed than Emmy. How to Teach Physics to Your Dog will show you the universe that lies beneath everyday reality, in all its randomness, uncertainty, and wonder. \"Forget Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat,\" says Emmy, \"quantum physics is all about dogs.\" And once you see quantum physics explained to a dog, you'll never see the world the same way again.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416579014"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "141657901X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Teach_Quantum_Physics_to_Your_Dog.html?hl=&id=K3rdKqmBPacC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_to_Teach_Quantum_Physics_to_Your_Dog-sample-epub.acsm?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=K3rdKqmBPacC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kRXbAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "h9ve/B56CCY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kRXbAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Canine Behavior", "subtitle": "A Photo Illustrated Handbook", "publisher": "Dogwise Publishing", "publishedDate": "2012-12-12", "description": "<b>The ebook version of this book is FULL color throughout!</b> <a href=\"http://dogwise.com/images/dogworldtop12.jpg\">A Dog World Top 12 Training and Behavior Book - 2010!</a><br><br>Dogs have deliberate, subtle, and often humorous ways of expressing themselves.

Drawing on stories of animals both wild and domestic, the two authors, also best friends, created this book to put humans back into the animal world. The more we learn about what other animals think and do, they explain, the more we understand ourselves as animals, too. Writes Montgomery, \u201cThe list of attributes once thought to be unique to our species\u2015from using tools to waging war\u2015is not only rapidly shrinking, but starting to sound less and less impressive when we compare them with other animals\u2019 powers.\u201d With humor, empathy, and introspection, Montgomery and Thomas look into the lives of all kinds of creatures\u2015from man\u2019s best friend to the great white shark\u2015and examine the ways we connect with our fellow species. Both authors have devoted their lives to sharing the animal kingdom\u2019s magic with others, and their combined wisdom is an indispensable contribution to the field of animal literature.

He has a plane ticket to South America, a teaching position in a prestigious Argentine boarding school, and endless summer holidays. He even has a motorbike, Che Guevara style. What he doesn't need is a pet. What he really doesn't need is a pet penguin. Set against Argentina's turbulent years following the collapse of the corrupt Per\u00f3nist regime, this is the heart-warming story of Juan Salvador the penguin, rescued by Tom from an oil slick in Uruguay just days before a new term. When the bird refuses to leave Tom's side, the young teacher has no choice but to smuggle it across the border, through customs, and back to school. Whether it's as the rugby team's mascot, the housekeeper's confidant, the host at Tom's parties or the most flamboyant swimming coach in world history, Juan Salvador transforms the lives of all he meets - in particular one homesick school boy. And as for Tom, he discovers in Juan Salvador a compadre like no other... The Penguin Lessons is a unique and moving true story which has captured imaginations around the globe - for all those who dreamed as a child they might one day talk to the animals.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781405921824"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "140592182X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 500.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 250.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NM6kCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 500320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 250160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Penguin_Lessons-sample-epub.acsm?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NM6kCQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "wmJLDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "L/ol5ZiKXAM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wmJLDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Equitation Science", "authors": ["Paul McGreevy", "Janne Winther Christensen", "Uta K\u00f6nig von Borstel", "Andrew McLean"], "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons", "publishedDate": "2018-04-23", "description": "A new edition of a highly respected textbook and reference in the rapidly emerging field of equitation science.

Small Cattle for Small Farms is ideal for those people considering buying a small farm for lifestyle or commercial purposes. Written in response to the many questions the author was asked by those seeking to purchase small cattle, this practical and easy to understand guide provides an excellent introduction to small farming. The book assumes no prior experience with cattle, and covers all the basics to help you set up your small farm, including: types of cattle available, how to select your stock and care for them, stocking rates, fencing needs, vaccination requirements, methods of identification, and government requirements for land and stockowners. For those wishing to show their cattle, there is a chapter explaining how to prepare for competitions. A section on marketing details how to make a successful entry into the commercial beef industry, and a list of cattle organisations directs readers to more specific information for their chosen breeds.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780643099562"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0643099565"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 168, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Pets&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unvjUiyDCx8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2081, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2081, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&rdid=book-unvjUiyDCx8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2081000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2081000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Cattle_for_Small_Farms-sample-epub.acsm?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Small_Cattle_for_Small_Farms-sample-pdf.acsm?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=unvjUiyDCx8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lqotLwbtkmUC", "etag": "nfmAGEqbxMU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lqotLwbtkmUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Heroes of the High Seas", "authors": ["J.

Trull was no stranger to rescuing abandoned animals. She and her husband Mark had made it their mission to find permanent homes for stray dogs and cats. Now her young students were determined to save these lost pups and others like them. And in that moment, the Dalhart Animal Wellness Group and Sanctuary\u2014known as DAWGS\u2014was born. How Trull and her fourth graders started their own animal shelter is a story of dedication, commitment, and perseverance. In this eye-opening, deeply personal book, Trull describes the challenges they faced, from rescuing and caring for the animals to teaching children about compassion and responsibility, to facing local interests opposed to having a shelter in their town.

This is the perfect treat for anyone: *Whose dog has control of the remote (and flips when watching dog food commercials) *Whose dog occasionally allows him to sleep in the bed (but only if he doesn't hog the covers!) *Who doesn't even notice the dog hairs in their food *Who carries their dog when he gets winded Anyone who has a canine companion will want this charming book.
