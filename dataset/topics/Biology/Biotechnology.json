Lara", "Guillermo Gosset"], "publisher": "Springer Nature", "publishedDate": "2019-12-04", "description": "This book provides a comprehensive overview of the design, generation and characterization of minimal cell systems. Written by leading experts, it presents an in-depth analysis of the current issues and challenges in the field, including recent advances in the generation and characterization of reduced-genome strains generated from model organisms with relevance in biotechnology, and basic research such as Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and yeast. It also discusses methodologies, such as bottom-up and top-down genome minimization strategies, as well as novel analytical and experimental approaches to characterize and generate minimal cells. Lastly, it presents the latest research related to minimal cells of serveral microorganisms, e.g. Bacillus subtilis. The design of biological systems for biotechnological purposes employs strategies aimed at optimizing specific tasks. This approach is based on enhancing certain biological functions while reducing other capacities that are not required or that could be detrimental to the desired objective. A highly optimized cell factory would be expected to have only the capacity for reproduction and for performing the expected task. Such a hypothetical organism would be considered a minimal cell. At present, numerous research groups in academia and industry are exploring the theoretical and practical implications of constructing and using minimal cells and are providing valuable fundamental insights into the characteristics of minimal genomes, leading to an understanding of the essential gene set. In addition, research in this field is providing valuable information on the physiology of minimal cells and their utilization as a biological chassis to which useful biotechnological functions can be added.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030318970"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030318974"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 230, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-QNTBDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Minimal_Cells_Design_Construction_Biotec-sample-epub.acsm?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Minimal_Cells_Design_Construction_Biotec-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QNTBDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CIPPBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "bXcYjv6s1WY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CIPPBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Analysis of Individual and Integrated Packed-Bed Membrane Reactors for Oxidative Coupling of Methane", "authors": ["Hamid Reza Godini"], "publisher": "epubli", "publishedDate": "2014-10-13", "description": "The procedure and the results of model-based and experimental analysis of individual and integrated porous packed-bed membrane reactor for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) process are provided.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783737512428"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3737512426"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CIPPBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CIPPBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CIPPBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CIPPBAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Analysis_of_Individual_and_Integrated_Pa.html?hl=&id=CIPPBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CIPPBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AKxiS4AKpyEC", "etag": "uZTrLHc9fJM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AKxiS4AKpyEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cellular Materials in Nature and Medicine", "authors": ["Lorna J.

However, not many sources are available for the pharmaceutical develop ment scientist and other personnel responsible for the commercialization of the finished dosage forms of these new biopharmaceuticals and other products from biotechnology. This text will help to fill this gap. Once active biopharmaceutical molecules are candidates for clinical trial investigation and subsequent commercialization, a number of other activities must take place while research and development on these molecules continues.

Immediately goals of this area of research include identification of the life-supporting functions of proteins, and the fundamental forces that facilitate these functions. Upon reaching these goals, we shall have the understanding to direct and the tools required to implement changes that will dramatically improve the quality of life. For example, under standing the chemical mechanism of diseases will facilitate development of new therapeutic drugs. Likewise, understanding of chemical mechanisms of plant growth will be used with biotechnology to improve food production under adverse climatic conditions. The challenge to understand details of protein structure/function relationships is enormous and requires an international effort for success. To direct the chemistry and biology of our environment in a positive sense will require efforts from bright, imaginative scientists located throughout the world.

The importance of computational function prediction is increasing because more and more large scale biological data, including genome sequences, protein structures, protein-protein interaction data, microarray expression data, and mass spectrometry data, are awaiting biological interpretation. Traditionally when a genome is sequenced, function annotation of genes is done by homology search methods, such as BLAST or FASTA. However, since these methods are developed before the genomics era, conventional use of them is not necessarily most suitable for analyzing a large scale data. Therefore we observe emerging development of computational gene function prediction methods, which are targeted to analyze large scale data, and also those which use such omics data as additional source of function prediction. In this book, we overview this emerging exciting field. The authors have been selected from 1) those who develop novel purely computational methods 2) those who develop function prediction methods which use omics data 3) those who maintain and update data base of function annotation of particular model organisms (E. coli), which are frequently referred", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400708815"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400708815"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 310, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.7.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdid=book-UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-epub.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sZMJsjvvzVUC", "etag": "GCBOlIVoWNY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sZMJsjvvzVUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ana Techniqs in Biotechnology", "authors": ["Goutam Bhowmik"], "publisher": "Tata McGraw-Hill Education", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "'Analytical Techniques in Biotechnology' by Bhowmik and Bose offers a unique compendium of fundamental experiments, which forms the crucial foundation to understand this contemporary subject that has enormous impact on many other branches of life sciences.

Along with these kinds of questions, majority of the questions in this book have been designed to assess the candidate's understanding of the subject. It is perhaps for the first time where questions have four to six choice statements, which are to be understood to find the right answer. One has to think and remember what he has learnt to be able to answer these questions.

I was very fortunate to work for the company that begat the biotech industry during its formative years. This experience established a solid foundation from which I could grow in both the science and business of biotechnology. After my fourth year of working on Oyster Point Boulevard, a close friend and colleague left Genentech to join a start-up biotechnology company. Later, he approached me to leave and join him in of all places \u2013 Oklahoma. He persisted for at least a year before I seriously considered his proposal. After listening to their plans, the opportunity suddenly became more and more intriguing. Finally, I took the plunge and joined this ent- preneurial team in cofounding and growing a start-up biotechnology company. Making that fateful decision to leave the security of a larger company was extremely difficult, but it turned out to be the beginning of an entrepreneurial career that forever changed how I viewed the biotechnology industry. Since that time, I have been fortunate to have cofounded two other biotechnology com- nies and even participated in taking one of them public. During my career in these start-ups, I held a variety of positions, from directing the science, operations, regulatory, and marketing components, to subsequently becoming CEO.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1441900640"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781441900647"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 269, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GQe9xozuENUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GQe9xozuENUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GQe9xozuENUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQe9xozuENUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQe9xozuENUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQe9xozuENUC&rdid=book-GQe9xozuENUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Business_of_Bioscience-sample-epub.acsm?id=GQe9xozuENUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Business_of_Bioscience-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GQe9xozuENUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GQe9xozuENUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "dZrZuZgyCzUC", "etag": "0HErtCBXZbw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dZrZuZgyCzUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Advanced Physicochemical Treatment Technologies", "authors": ["Lawrence K.

It is relatively easy to identify the success stories of membranes such as desali nation and microfiltration and to refer to others as developing areas. This, however, does not do justice to the wide field of separations in which membranes are used. No other 'single' process offers the same potential and versatility as that of membranes. The word separation classically conjures up a model of removing one component or species from a second component, for example a mass transfer process such as distillation. In the field of synthetic membranes, the terminology 'separation' is used in a wider context. A range of separations of the chemical/mass transfer type have developed around the use of membranes including distillation, extraction, absorption, adsorption and stripping, as well as separations of the physical type such as filtration. Synthetic membranes are an integral part of devices for analysis, energy generation and reactors (cells) in the electrochemical industry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401106276"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401106274"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 305, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=053uCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-053uCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Industrial_Membrane_Separation_Technolog-sample-epub.acsm?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Industrial_Membrane_Separation_Technolog-sample-pdf.acsm?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=053uCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "MujUlI7X9IUC", "etag": "APrR5MtiDLM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MujUlI7X9IUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cell Engineering", "authors": ["Mohamed Al-Rubeai"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2007-11-23", "description": "Integrating advances in molecular biology into bioprocesses presents a continuous challenge to scientists and bioengineers. This series is conceived to help meet this challenge. It examines and assesses the feasibility of new approaches for the modification of cellular function such as gene expression, protein processing, secretion, glycosylation, immortalisation, proliferation, and apoptosis as well as the systematic study of the metabolic genotype-phenotype relationship. The series provides detailed coverage of the methodology for improving cellular properties of cells used in the production of biopharmaceuticals, gene and cell therapies and tissue engineering. It also seeks to explain the cellular mechanisms underlying in vitro physiological activity and productivity. This volume, which is based on presentations at the `European Workshop on Animal Cell Engineering' held in Costa Brava, Spain, contains a collection of chapters relating to cellular function and modification by leading authorities in several different areas of basic research and the biopharmaceutical industry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0585379718"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780585379715"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 302, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MujUlI7X9IUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MujUlI7X9IUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MujUlI7X9IUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MujUlI7X9IUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MujUlI7X9IUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MujUlI7X9IUC&rdid=book-MujUlI7X9IUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cell_Engineering-sample-pdf.acsm?id=MujUlI7X9IUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MujUlI7X9IUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AYCC8FLbX2wC", "etag": "S8p5q7n3V84", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AYCC8FLbX2wC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Rabbit Biotechnology", "subtitle": "Rabbit genomics, transgenesis, cloning and models", "authors": ["Louis-Marie Houdebine", "Jianglin Fan"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2009-04-24", "description": "Louis-Marie Houdebine and Jianglin Fan The study of biological functions of proteins and their possible roles in the pathogenesis of human diseases requires more and more relevant animal m- els. Although mice including genetically modified mice offer many possibilities, other non-murine species are absolutely required in some circumstances. Rabbit is one of these species, which has been widely used in biomedical studies. This animal is genetically and physiologically closer to humans including cardiov- cular system and metabolism characteristics. Rabbit is thus more appropriate than mice to study some diseases such as atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism. Because of its larger size, surgery manipulation, bleeding, and turn-over studies are much easier performed in rabbits than in mice. Furthermore, transgenic rabbits can be produced using microinjection and other methods such as lentiviral v- tors. Cloning in rabbits has been proved possible, even though still laborious and time-consuming. Hopefully, functional rabbit ES cell lines will be available in the coming years. Gene deletion or knock-out in rabbits will then become possible.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789048122271"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9048122279"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 136, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&rdid=book-AYCC8FLbX2wC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rabbit_Biotechnology-sample-epub.acsm?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rabbit_Biotechnology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]}
