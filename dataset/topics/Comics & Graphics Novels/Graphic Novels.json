Secondly, that of a wide range of topics concerning the concept of \"visual narrative,\" an issue which can only be studied by comparing as many media and practices as possible.The essays of this volume are grouped here in two major parts, their focus depending on either a more general topic or on a very specific graphic author. The first part of the book, \"Violence and trauma in the Graphic Novel\", opens with a certain number of reflections on the representation of violence in literary and visual graphic novels, and continues with a whole set of close readings of graphic novels by Art Spiegelman (Maus I and II) and Jacques Tardi (whose masterwork \"C'?tait la guerre des tranch'es\" is still waiting for its complete English translation). The second part of the book presents in the first place a survey of the current graphic novel production, and insists sharply on the great diversity of the range in the various 'continental' traditions (for instance underground 'comix', and feminist comics, high-art graphic novels, critical superheroes-fiction) whose separation is nowadays increasingly difficult to maintain. It continues and ends with a set of theoretical interventions where not only the reciprocal influences of national and international traditions, but also those between genres and media are strongly forwarded, the emphasis being here mainly on problems concerning ways of looking and positions of spectatorship.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9058671097"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789058671097"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 212, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KEWX-9jdNzoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KEWX-9jdNzoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KEWX-9jdNzoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KEWX-9jdNzoC&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Graphic_Novel.html?hl=&id=KEWX-9jdNzoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KEWX-9jdNzoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The essays collected in this volume were first presented at the international and interdisciplinary conference on the Graphic Novel hosted by the Institute for Cultural Studies (University of Leuven) in 2000.The issues discusses by the ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WkHCDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "+36S9Zy1s1w", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WkHCDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Dreaming the Graphic Novel", "subtitle": "The Novelization of Comics", "authors": ["Paul Williams"], "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "publishedDate": "2020-01-17", "description": "The term \u201cgraphic novel\u201d was first coined in 1964, but it wouldn\u2019t be broadly used until the 1980s, when graphic novels such as Watchmen and Maus achieved commercial success and critical acclaim. What happened in the intervening years, after the graphic novel was conceptualized yet before it was widely recognized? Dreaming the Graphic Novel examines how notions of the graphic novel began to coalesce in the 1970s, a time of great change for American comics, with declining sales of mainstream periodicals, the arrival of specialty comics stores, and (at least initially) a thriving underground comix scene. Surveying the eclectic array of long comics narratives that emerged from this fertile period, Paul Williams investigates many texts that have fallen out of graphic novel history. As he demonstrates, the question of what makes a text a \u2018graphic novel\u2019 was the subject of fierce debate among fans, creators, and publishers, inspiring arguments about the literariness of comics that are still taking place among scholars today.

David Lewis", "Christine Hoff Kraemer"], "publisher": "A&C Black", "publishedDate": "2010-10-21", "description": "Comic books have increasingly become a vehicle for serious social commentary and, specifically, for innovative religious thought. Practitioners of both traditional religions and new religious movements have begun to employ comics as a missionary tool, while humanists and religious progressives use comics' unique fusion of text and image to criticize traditional theologies and to offer alternatives. Addressing the increasing fervor with which the public has come to view comics as an art form and Americans' fraught but passionate relationship with religion, Graven Images explores with real insight the roles of religion in comic books and graphic novels. In essays by scholars and comics creators, Graven Images observes the frequency with which religious material\u0097in devout, educational, satirical, or critical contexts\u0097occurs in both independent and mainstream comics. Contributors identify the unique advantages of the comics medium for religious messages; analyze how comics communicate such messages; place the religious messages contained in comic books in appropriate cultural, social, and historical frameworks; and articulate the significance of the innovative theologies being developed in comics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780826430267"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0826430260"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 366, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Graven_Images.html?hl=&id=X1QGu16o0OoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Graven_Images-sample-epub.acsm?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=X1QGu16o0OoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Addressing the increasing fervor with which the public has come to view comics as an art form and Americans&#39; fraught but passionate relationship with religion, Graven Images explores with real insight the roles of religion in comic books ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8ExXDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "EyCeA2sA6EQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8ExXDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Shot All to Hell", "subtitle": "A Graphic Novel", "authors": ["Nate Olson", "Gardner"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2018-09-04", "description": "Discover the incredible true story behind the most famous bank robbery of all time in this thrilling graphic novel adaptation of Mark Lee Gardner\u2019s award-winning book Shot All to Hell: Jesse James, The Northfield Raid, and the Wild West\u2019s Greatest Escape.

He considers the aesthetic and entrepreneurial innovations that established the conditions for the rise of the graphic novel all over the world. Garc\u00eda not only treats the formal components of the art, but also examines the cultural position of comics in various formats as a popular medium. Typically associated with children, often viewed as unedifying and even at times as a threat to moral character, comics art has come a long way. With such examples from around the world as Spain, France, Germany, and Japan, Garc\u00eda illustrates how the graphic novel, with its increasingly global and aesthetically sophisticated profile, represents a new model for graphic narrative production that empowers authors and challenges longstanding social prejudices against comics and what they can achieve.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type":

By focussing on a range of landmark comics from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the discussion draws attention to the ongoing role of visual culture in framing testimony, particularly in relation to underprivileged subjects such as migrants and refugees, individuals dealing with war and oppressive regimes and individuals living with particular health conditions. The discussion is influenced by literary and cultural debates on the intersections between ethics, testimony, trauma, and human rights, reflected in its three overarching questions: \u2018How do comics usually complicate the production of cultural memory in local contents and global mediascapes?\u2019, \u2018How do comics engage with, and generate, new forms of testimonial address?\u2019, and \u2018How do the comics function as mnemonic structures?\u2019 The author highlights that the power of comics is that they allow both creators and readers to visualise the fracturing power of violence and oppression \u2013 at the level of the individual, domestic, communal, national and international \u2013 in powerful and creative ways. Comics do not stand outside of literature, cinema, or any of the other arts, but rather enliven the reciprocal relationship between the verbal and the visual language that informs all of these media. As such, the discussion demonstrates how fields such as graphic medicine, graphic justice, and comics journalism contribute to existing theoretical and analytics debates, including critical visual theory, trauma and memory studies, by offering a broad ranging, yet cohesive, analysis of cultural memory and its representation in print and digital comics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781317066095"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "131706609X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 198, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YQuWDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Representation_and_Memory_in_Graphic_Nov-sample-epub.acsm?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Representation_and_Memory_in_Graphic_Nov-sample-pdf.acsm?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YQuWDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book analyses the relationship between comics and cultural memory."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AFSNAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "IprpfJEjQUg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AFSNAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Artemis Fowl", "subtitle": "The Graphic Novel", "authors": ["Eoin Colfer"], "publisher": "Penguin UK", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30", "description": "A stunning graphic-novel adaptation of the megaselling Artemis Fowl.

It demonstrates that artists' documentary use of this medium is a form of social realism, inextricably bound up with politics and ideology. Theoretical and visual approaches are employed throughout, introducing the principal themes of the graphic novels under scrutiny: political realism, visual documentary, traumatic childhood, ethnic discrimination, state oppression, and military occupation. The key works examined are Keiji Nakazawa's Barefoot Gen, Joe Sacco's Palestine, Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, W.G. Sebald's Emigrants and Art Spiegelman's Maus. Innovative techniques, radical methods of depiction, sequence and text organisation are analysed throughout to explain how the authors use visual realism to represent these social crises.

It covers every element, from conceptualising a composition involving characters and backgrounds, equipment, locations for settings, and lighting the model. Included in this book is a selection of photographs of models, props, and backgrounds for artists to use in their drawing. Also included are tips on how to draw props, plus detailed examples and principles on how to draw and render clothing, facial expressions and action poses.

In response to the predominantly negative readings of kitsch as meaningless or inappropriate, this book offers a fresh approach that considers how some of the kitsch strategies employed in these works facilitate an affective interaction with the genocide narrative. These productive strategies include the use of the visual metaphors of the animal and the doll figure and the explicit and excessive depictions of mass violence. The book also analyses where kitsch still produces problems as it critically examines depictions of perpetrators and the visual and verbal representations of sexual violence.

Adaptation", "authors": ["Octavia E. Butler"], "publisher": "Abrams", "publishedDate": "2017-01-10", "description": "Octavia E. Butler\u2019s bestselling literary science-fiction masterpiece, Kindred, now in graphic novel format. More than 35 years after its release, Kindred continues to draw in new readers with its deep exploration of the violence and loss of humanity caused by slavery in the United States, and its complex and lasting impact on the present day. Adapted by celebrated academics and comics artists Damian Duffy and John Jennings, this graphic novel powerfully renders Butler\u2019s mysterious and moving story, which spans racial and gender divides in the antebellum South through the 20th century. Butler\u2019s most celebrated, critically acclaimed work tells the story of Dana, a young black woman who is suddenly and inexplicably transported from her home in 1970s California to the pre\u2013Civil War South. As she time-travels between worlds, one in which she is a free woman and one where she is part of her own complicated familial history on a southern plantation, she becomes frighteningly entangled in the lives of Rufus, a conflicted white slaveholder and one of Dana\u2019s own ancestors, and the many people who are enslaved by him. Held up as an essential work in feminist, science-fiction, and fantasy genres, and a cornerstone of the Afrofuturism movement, there are over 500,000 copies of Kindred in print. The intersectionality of race, history, and the treatment of women addressed within the original work remain critical topics in contemporary dialogue, both in the classroom and in the public sphere. Frightening, compelling, and richly imagined, Kindred offers an unflinching look at our complicated social history, transformed by the graphic novel format into a visually stunning work for a new generation of readers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781613128626"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1613128622"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Comics & Graphic Novels"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 909, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 425.58, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-l3eqDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 909000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 425580000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Kindred_A_Graphic_Novel_Adaptation-sample-epub.acsm?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Kindred_A_Graphic_Novel_Adaptation-sample-pdf.acsm?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=l3eqDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Adapted by celebrated academics and comics artists Damian Duffy and John Jennings, this graphic novel powerfully renders Butler\u2019s mysterious and moving story, which spans racial and gender divides in the antebellum South through the 20th ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8vvENkF_MQUC", "etag": "uifhC9rxIS4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8vvENkF_MQUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Adventures in Graphica", "subtitle": "Using Comics and Graphic Novels to Teach Comprehension, 2-6", "authors": ["Terry Thompson"], "publisher": "Stenhouse Publishers", "publishedDate": "2008", "description": "Comic books and graphic novels, known collectively as \"graphica,\" have long been popular with teenagers and adults. Recently graphica has grown in popularity with younger readers as well, motivating and engaging some of our most reluctant readers who often shun traditional texts. While some teachers have become curious about graphica's potential, many are confused by the overwhelming number of new titles and series, in both fiction and nonfiction, and are unsure of its suitability and function in their classrooms. Drawing on his own success using graphica with elementary students, literacy coach Terry Thompson introduces reading teachers to this popular medium and suggests sources of appropriate graphica for the classroom and for particular students. Taking cues from research that supports the use of graphica with students, Terry shows how this exciting medium fits into the literacy framework and correlates with best practices in comprehension, vocabulary, and fluency instruction. Adventures in Graphica contains numerous, easy-to-replicate, instructional strategies, including examples of how graphic texts can be used to create a bridge as students transfer abstract comprehension strategies learned through comics and graphic novels to traditional texts. Adventures in Graphica provides a roadmap for teachers to the medium that the New York Times recently hailed as possibly \"the next new literary form.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781571107121"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1571107126"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 188, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Comics & Graphic Novels"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8vvENkF_MQUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8vvENkF_MQUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8vvENkF_MQUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8vvENkF_MQUC&dq=Graphic+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Adventures_in_Graphica.html?hl=&id=8vvENkF_MQUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Adventures_in_Graphica-sample-epub.acsm?id=8vvENkF_MQUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8vvENkF_MQUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Adventures in Graphica contains numerous, easy-to-replicate, instructional strategies, including examples of how graphic texts can be used to create a bridge as students transfer abstract comprehension strategies learned through comics and ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "uTQlDAAAQBAJ", "etag": "IshW9WERt88", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/uTQlDAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ethel & Ernest", "authors": ["Raymond Briggs"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2016-05-19", "description": "A marvellous, life-enhancing book for all ages, now a major animated film starring Jim Broadbent, Brenda Blethyn and Luke Treadaway Utterly original, deeply moving and very funny, Ethel & Ernest tells the story of Raymond Briggs' parents' marriage, lady's maid Ethel and milkman Ernest, from their first chance encounter in 1928, through the birth of their son Raymond in 1934, to their deaths, within months of each other, in 1971.
