The total of some 400 carvings include important pre-Viking Age monuments, such as the crosses at Croft, Easby and Masham. The excavated sculpture from Whitby Abbey include a range of inscriptions which form crucial epigraphical evidence for our understanding of the pre-Conquest monastery. But Anglo-Scandinavian monuments predominate, with major collections at Brompton, Kirklevington and Lythe. A number of workshops have been identified and it was in this area that the hogback recumbent memorial first appeared. Much of the Anglian sculpture has stylistic connections with western Yorkshire and Mercia, and the wider connections with Europe are manifest in the iconography and styles of the great crosses at Easby, Masham and Cundall/Aldborough. There are strong Irish links with the area in the Anglo-Scandinavian period.

Vesuvius in A.D. 79, then rediscovered in 1750-contained a large collection of bronze and marble statuary and busts. Before they were published or exhibited, the sculptures were restored so as to appear whole: it is thus that they helped to shape early modern tastes in classical sculpture. The book describes the nature of the ancient sculptures and their impact on the modern public. Their chance discovery affected the interpretation of the statues-their styles and subjects-over the course of the next 250 years. The ancient sculptures were copied extensively in reproductions of various sizes and patinas. The author traces the popularity of these copies in Europe and America. Also presented in the book is a technical study of the production techniques and materials of the sculptures, as well as of their modern restoration history. Scientific analyses and detailed photographs reveal both how the pieces were cast and pieced together in antiquity and how they were restored in the eighteenth century. Even though this collection has been known for two and a half centuries, this book covers for the first time the eclectic nature of the sculptures, their acutual condition, and their quality, pointing in some cases to mass production.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0892367229"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780892367221"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 390, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uv6fpmbOSj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uv6fpmbOSj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uv6fpmbOSj0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uv6fpmbOSj0C&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Villa_Dei_Papiri_at_Herculaneum.html?hl=&id=uv6fpmbOSj0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uv6fpmbOSj0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EOeLDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "DKpnxumdTag", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EOeLDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Destruction of Art", "subtitle": "Iconoclasm and Vandalism Since the French Revolution", "authors": ["Dario Gamboni"], "publisher": "Reaktion Books", "publishedDate": "2007-05-15", "description": "\"This is the first comprehensive examination of modern iconoclasm. Dario Gamboni looks at deliberate attacks carried out - by institutions as well as individuals - on paintings, buildings, sculptures and other works of art in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Truly international in scope, \"The Destruction of Art\" examines incidents, some comic and others disquieting, in the USA, France, the former Soviet Union and other eastern bloc states, Britain, Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere. Motivated in the first instance by the recent destruction of many monuments in Europe's former Communist states, which challenged the assumption that iconoclasm was truly a thing of the past, the author has discovered just how widespread the destruction of art is today, manifested in explicable and inexplicable vandalism, political protest and censorship of all sorts. Dario Gamboni examines the relationship between contemporary destructions of art, older forms of iconoclasm and the development of modern art. His analysis is illustrated by case studies from Europe and the United States, from Suffragette protests in London's National Gallery to the controversy surrounding the removal of Richard Serra's Tilted Arc in New York and the resultant debate on artists' moral rights. \"The Destruction of Art\" asks what iconoclasm can teach us about the place of works of art and material culture in society. The history of iconoclasm is shown to reflect, and to contribute to, the changing and conflicting definitions of art itself.\" -- BOOK JACKET.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781861893161"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1861893167"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EOeLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EOeLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EOeLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EOeLDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Destruction_of_Art.html?hl=&id=EOeLDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EOeLDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TLPpAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "YX2soJRAExo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TLPpAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Digital Sculpting with Mudbox", "subtitle": "Essential Tools and Techniques for Artists", "authors": ["Mike de la Flor", "Bridgette Mongeon"], "publisher": "CRC Press", "publishedDate": "2012-10-12", "description": "Digital sculpting is the use of tools to push, pull, smooth, grab, pinch or otherwise manipulate a digital object as if it were made of a real-life substance such as clay.

This guide provides photographs, descriptions and directions for finding the monuments. Most of the monuments are in public parks. Three are World War I regimental memorials at former armories. The Mowgli Bas-reliefs are in the Prospect Park Zoo. The monuments are an enduring expression of Brooklyn's art-loving culture. Six were commissioned by the City of Brooklyn, the most monuments with sculptures commissioned by any nineteenth-century city in the United States. The Brooklyn commissions are some of the finest examples of American figurative sculpture. Seven other monuments are major works by America's ablest sculptors - Henry Kirke Brown, John Quincy Adams Ward, Daniel Chester French, Frederick William MacMonnies, Henry Merwin Shrady, Charles Cary Rumsey, and Augustus Lukeman. Elmer Sprague grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska where Lee Lawrie's sculptures on the state capitol dominate the city. They started Sprague on his long-time hobby of sculpture watching. On retiring from teaching philosophy at Brooklyn College, he worked for several years as a volunteer archivist in the New York City Parks Department helping to develop the database that describes New York City's public monuments. Sprague has also spent many happy days visiting, photographing and researching the Borough of Brooklyn's public monuments.

In this landmark essay, Herder combines rationalist and empiricist thought with a wide range of sources\u2014from the classics to Norse legend, Shakespeare to the Bible\u2014to illuminate the ways we experience sculpture. Standing on the fault line between classicism and romanticism, Herder draws most of his examples from classical sculpture, while nevertheless insisting on the historicity of art and of the senses themselves. Through a detailed analysis of the differences between painting and sculpture, he develops a powerful critique of the dominance of vision both in the appreciation of art and in our everyday apprehension of the world around us. One of the key articulations of the aesthetics of Sturm und Drang, Sculpture is also important as an anticipation of subsequent developments in art theory. Jason Gaiger's translation of Sculpture includes an extensive introduction to Herder's thought, explanatory notes, and illustrations of all the sculptures discussed in the text.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0226327558"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226327556"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 141, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CXZgR1riM5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CXZgR1riM5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CXZgR1riM5wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CXZgR1riM5wC&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sculpture.html?hl=&id=CXZgR1riM5wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sculpture-sample-epub.acsm?id=CXZgR1riM5wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CXZgR1riM5wC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6zbw5ZTqsJgC", "etag": "w4cRvTls69s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6zbw5ZTqsJgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "PASSING THE TORCH fifty years of metal sculpture techniques", "publisher": "Lulu.com", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781430318842"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1430318848"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6zbw5ZTqsJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6zbw5ZTqsJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6zbw5ZTqsJgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6zbw5ZTqsJgC&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/PASSING_THE_TORCH_fifty_years_of_metal_s.html?hl=&id=6zbw5ZTqsJgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6zbw5ZTqsJgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_RoKRorTgWEC", "etag": "Oda6YY93P+o", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_RoKRorTgWEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Catalogue of the Sculpture in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection from the Ptolemaic Period to the Renaissance", "authors": ["Dumbarton Oaks", "Gary Vikan"], "publisher": "Dumbarton Oaks", "publishedDate": "1995", "description": "These sculptures reflect the Blisses' wide-ranging tastes and extraordinary connoisseurship.

The photographs in this book attempt to capture some of those effects, showing statues in different kinds of light, in context with other works, and in close-up detail. An introductory essay and extended notes on each work of art give background information. The photography is by Joseph Coscia, Jr., Associate Chief Photographer in the Museum's Photograph Studio. The text is by Elizabeth J. Milleker, Associate Curator in the Department of Greek and Roman Art.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

This pathbreaking and authoritative book tells the story of this sculpture, beginning with the art of the kingdom of Dvaravati in the seventh century and ending with the abandonment of the city of Ayutthaya in 1767. Hiram W. Woodward, Jr., the principal author, bases his account on a study of the most important and comprehensive collection outside Thailand, that formed by the pioneering American scholar Alexander B. Griswold and bequeathed to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland. An unprecedented array of technical tests has been carried out on the Griswold sculptures. Thermoluminescence analysis has determined age, metal analysis has revealed the content of the alloys, and clay-core analysis has provided insights into probable place of origin. Conclusions drawn from these tests have been integrated into Dr. Woodward's narrative. Never before has the sequence of styles and the development of regional traditions been presented so clearly. The results of the tests, presented in full, will be a resource for students of Thai art for decades.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0295976659"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780295976655"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 326, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pw83AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pw83AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pw83AQAAIAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pw83AQAAIAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Sacred_Sculpture_of_Thailand.html?hl=&id=pw83AQAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pw83AQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y0skAQAAMAAJ", "etag": "rJYMoIBJPBw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y0skAQAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Modern painting and sculpture", "subtitle": "1880 to the present at the Museum of Modern Art", "authors": ["John Elderfield", "Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.)"], "publisher": "Hubsta Ltd", "publishedDate": "2004-12", "description": "This volume, published on the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of The Museum of Modern Art and the opening of its new building, is a comprehensive overview of its painting and sculpture collection.

When they first met in 1883, Rodin was forty-four and Claudel a promising sculptor of twenty. Despite the positive response of critics to her early work, Claudel, however, never experienced fame and success. The tragic circumstances of her life - the last thirty years were spent in a psychiatric hospital - have led to considerable speculation and interest in this enigmatic figure. To some she seemed to offer the classic example of a woman artist who was oppressed and abused by a successful man. This book examines Claudel's family background, her relationship to her parents and brother, and her behavior as documented by friends and family to determine to what extent her innate mental instability led to her eventual breakdown. What were the circumstances surrounding her commitment to an asylum and how did her family and Rodin react to her illness? Further, the author critically examines the relationship between the two artists: to what extent did they influence each other? How did Rodin really treat Claudel? Finally and most importantly, Claudel's oeuvre is investigated in terms of her biography and in relationship to her contemporaries in an attempt to evaluate her work as a sculptor and to understand the personal and artistic crisis she underwent after severing her relationship with Rodin.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Moreover, modernist aesthetics has come to be equated with the concept of formalism, which has been both advocated and attacked in the critical roster of the twentieth century. Adrian Stokes offered a singular critical voice challenging us to think differently about modernism. Guided by his personal interpretation of the early Renaissance and by insights derived from psychoanalytic theory, Stokes developed his own style of communicating the truths of aesthetic experience. The essays in The Coral Mind make Stokes required reading for anyone with a serious interest in British modernism; psychoanalysis and art; alternatives to Clement Greenberg's account of modernism; the relevance of architecture, sculpture, and ballet to our understanding of twentieth-century art; \u201cwriterly\u201d art criticism; and the concept of \u201cresearch\u201d in art history.

At its heart was Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world, built during the reign of the Khmer king Suryavarman II, in the first half of the twelfth century. The temple was dedicated to Vishnu, and its magnificent architecture mirrored in microcosm the entire Hindu universe. To enhance its sacred nature, over 600 meters of bas-reliefs were carved on the walls of the third enclosure illustrating battles and processions, Heavens and Hells and the creation myth. Following the great success of Vittorio Roveda's Khmer Mythology , which unraveled the stories and significance of the relief carvings of numerous Khmer, the author returns to Angkor Wat to examine the magnificent carvings of the long galleries, the corner pavilions, pediments, lintels, as well as the lesser-known sculpted tapestry reliefs. The gradual reading of the reliefs as pages of an ancient book unravel the religious and secular symbolism with which Angkor Wat was imbued by the Khmers in the XII century.

Of the discovered works of African sculpture that are more than a century old, at least ninety per cent are Nigerian, and it is in Nigeria alone that we can trace the history of tribal art during more than 2,000 years.Nigerian Images was first published over a quarter of a century ago and rapidly achieved the status of a classic. It consists of a magnificent compilation of photographs illustrating this rich and brilliantly varied art history, together with an interpretation of it by a distinguished ethnographer and art historian. In superb plates and penetrating historical analysis, Nigerian Images reveals the complexity and richness of tribal art forms and relates them to the cultural, philosophical, and political world in which they were created.The first part of the text, illustrated by 77 plates - of both rare, little-known pieces and some of the classic heads that have become famous the world over - considers Nigerian art prior to about 1850. European miners first began to mine tin in Nigeria early in this century, but it was not until some forty years later that it was realized that priceless works of art were being crushed and discarded every day in the spoil heaps around the mines. These were primarily terracottas from the Nok culture - magnificent figures dating from about 500 BC to AD 200, and they are the starting point for the author's survey. There follows an analysis of Ife terracottas a thousand years later and the famous Benin bronzes.In the second part of the book, illustrated with 68 plates, William Fagg discusses Nigerian art since about 1850, including the remarkable beauty of the Yoruba wood carvings, the masks of the Ibibio and Mama, and the ivories, drums, and other pieces from many other tribes as well, vigorously rejecting the view that it has shown any decline in vitality, power, or conceptual originality from the earlier works.William Fagg's text provides not only an invaluable introduction to the development of tribal arts, but many new and important interpretations and attributions. To his uniquely authoritative textual analysis, Herbert List brings, in 144 remarkable photographs, the intense poetic feeling and acute sense of form that made him an artist of international renown.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015018941131"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 124, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art, Nigerian"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gq3qAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gq3qAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gq3qAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gq3qAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Nigerian_Images.html?hl=&id=gq3qAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gq3qAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "mlbqAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "XW/QseO7c4Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mlbqAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Sculpture of Gilbert Ledward", "authors": ["Catherine Moriarty"], "publisher": "Lund Humphries Pub Limited", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "Trained in the conventions of the late 19th century, Gilbert Ledward (1888-1960) adhered to representational values suited to public commemorative projects.

His figurative designs of those that fought remain evocative of the Great War and its cost.

While other artists pioneered the development of modern sculpture, ultimately towards abstraction, Ledward's work remained figurative. His belief that sculpture had a social purpose, both as a fine and an applied art, led to his involvement in a wide range of projects. In 1934 he co-founded the firm Sculptured Memorials and Headstones in an attempt to promote carving by regional artists in native stone. He made architectural sculpture for many major buildings in the capital. Academy in 1937 and a President of the RBS, Ledward was an outspoken member of the art establishment.

Sculpture is all around us: in public parks, squares, gardens and railway stations, as part of the architecture of buildings, or when used in commemoration and memorials and can even be considered in relation to furniture and industrial design. This book encourages you to consider the multiple forms and everyday guises sculpture can take. Exploring Western sculpture with examples from antiquity through to the present day, Mary Acton shows you how to analyse and fully experience sculpture, asking you to consider questions such as What do we mean by the sculptural vision? What qualities do we look for when viewing sculpture? How important is the influence of the Classical Tradition and what changed in the modern period? What difference does the scale and context make to our visual understanding? With chapters on different types of sculpture, such as free-standing figures, group sculpture and reliefs, and addressing how the experience of sculpture is fundamentally different due to the nature of its relationship to the space of its setting, the book also explores related themes, such as sculpture's connection with architecture, drawing and design, and what difference changing techniques can make to the tactile and physical experience of sculpture. Richly illustrated with over 200 images, including multiple points of view of three dimensional works, examples include the Riace bronzes, Michelangelo's David, Canova's The Three Graces, medieval relief sculptures, war memorials and works from modern and contemporary artists, such as Henry Moore, Cornelia Parker and Richard Serra, and three-dimensional designers like Thomas Heatherwick. A glossary of critical and technical terms, further reading and questions for students, make this the ideal companion for all those studying, or simply interested in, sculpture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415577373"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415577373"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 331, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mUtJXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mUtJXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mUtJXwAACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mUtJXwAACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Learning_to_Look_at_Sculpture.html?hl=&id=mUtJXwAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mUtJXwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "PmVQAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "BA27ZR7LHUc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/PmVQAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Sculpture of Nancy Graves", "subtitle": "A Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 with Essays", "authors": ["Ruth J.

Forming part of the spectacular setting for official functions, as well as the background to busy offices and the home of the Lord Mayor and his family, the sculpture ranges from handsome chimneypieces and elaborate stuccowork wall decorations to heroic single statues of figures from British literature and history.Described by the architectural historian Nicolaus Pevsner as magnificent marble statues, the sculptures are almost unknown to the general public. Their significance, however, is much greater than as an example of the changing fortunes of Victorian sculpture and of the fluctuating attitudes of the Corporation of London to art patronage. Taken as a whole, the sheer range and variety is exceptional. After the monuments in Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral and the galleries of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Mansion House presents the most extensive permanent exhibition of British sculpture in London. It differs from these rival collections in the range of its sculpture, from Palladian chimneypieces carved by City stonemasons and virtuoso Rococo plasterwork by anonymous stuccadors to heroic ideal statues made to rival the greatest works from antiquity and the Renaissance.The time has come for a fresh appreciation of these magnificent marble statues. The first book on the sculpture ever published, this beautifully illustrated study reveals the subjects of the sculptures, the stories behind the commissions and the importance of the artists themselves. New photography highlights the qualities of the individual sculptures in their historic settings. A unique insight to the challenges and delights of living, working and raising a family in Mansion House is given in an introductory essay by the Lady Mayoress, Clare Gifford. The sculptures and architecture are described by Julius Bryant, Keeper of Word and Image at the Victoria and Albert Museum. This beautifully produced new handbook provides a companion volume to The Harold Samuel Collection, Dutch and Flemish Pictures at the Mansion House (Paul Holberton Publishing, 2012) by Michael Hall and Clare Gifford.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1907372555"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781907372551"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false},

catalog that accompanies the inaugural exhibition, on view from October 2, 2005, through May 21, 2006, at the new Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University. The exhibition draws from the collection of the museum\u2019s benefactor, Raymond D. Nasher, and his late wife, Patsy. The Nashers built one of the world\u2019s major collections of twentieth-century sculpture over the course of forty years. The exhibition includes seminal works by Auguste Rodin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Alberto Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet, David Smith, Henry Moore, and others. Before sculpture, the Nashers collected ancient American art, Guatemalan textiles, contemporary prints, and paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. Many of these works, held in the Nashers\u2019 private residence, will be on public view\u2014and published in this full-color catalog\u2014for the first time. The book offers a new approach to viewing and thinking about the Nasher Collection, concentrating not on the final, finished product, \u201cthe greatest collection of modern sculpture in private hands,\u201d but on the unfolding of the process of building that collection through time, its chronological development from the early 1950s to the present. In the history of any collection, there is a narrative of evolution\u2014a beginning, which includes a motivation, followed by a process of change as the collector works out by experience and experimentation a personal approach to the gathering of objects of art. In the case of the Nasher collection, this personal approach is the result of a remarkable synergy between two individuals, Raymond D. Nasher and Patsy Nasher. The essay by curator Sarah Schroth contextualizes the Nashers as collectors within the history of collecting practices in the United States in the second half of the twentieth century.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015063309234"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 74, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L3pPAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L3pPAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=L3pPAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=L3pPAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Evolution_of_the_Nasher_Collection.html?hl=&id=L3pPAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=L3pPAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "zQ9QAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "32doNdfjc1I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zQ9QAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Lyrical Constructivist", "subtitle": "Don Gummer Sculpture", "authors": ["Don Gummer", "Peter Plagens", "Indiana State Museum"], "publisher": "Evansville Museum of Arts & science", "publishedDate": "2001", "description": "\"Don Gummer first came to the attention of the New York art scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s with his painted-wood wall reliefs - formally layered geometric arrangements with strong architectural influence.

Their goal is to motivate people to understand humanity's relationship to the planet, and to correct the negative impact of technology on the environment. \"One way to make art into a culturally useful tool\", writes philosopher and critic Suzi Gablik in her introductory essay, \"might be to infiltrate images of hope...

From the start his principal aim was to discover how Irish art fitted into its European context, an aim which led to a series of important comparative studies on major European monuments, both Romanesque and Gothic. Having begun his career as a historian, the author has been concerned with the social and political implications of medieval art, particularly the effect of the racial divisions that existed in medieval Ireland. He has written about Irish cathedrals, as well as the buildings of the Cistercian monks and Franciscan friars. He has also investigated the royal programme of castle building in the thirteenth century. Other essays in this volume include a fascinating account of the repercussions of the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, as well as a consideration of the influence of Viking styles on Hiberno-Romanesque sculpture. In recent years Professor Stalley has turned his attention to the high crosses, writing with authority on the iconography of these complex monuments. The opening essay in the volume is devoted to the patronage of Henry I's justiciar, Bishop Roger of Salisbury, whose cathedral at Sarum was destined to influence the course of Irish Romanesque.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015034528292"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 338, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MwrqAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MwrqAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MwrqAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MwrqAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Ireland_and_Europe_in_the_Middle_Ages.html?hl=&id=MwrqAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MwrqAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "x9BHAQAAIAAJ", "etag": "Q6fOMVNHB64", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/x9BHAQAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Animals in Bronze", "subtitle": "Reference and Price Guide", "authors": ["Christopher Payne"], "publisher": "Antique Collectors Club Limited", "publishedDate": "1986", "description": "From bird, cat and horse to ape and camel, Animals in Bronze examines and illustrates the work of hundreds of sculptors and founders who have worked in this highly popular and much-collected field.

Consisting of more than 500 ancient marbles - the UK's largest collection of Roman sculptures after that of the British Museum - the collection was assembled primarily in Italy during Blundell's various \"Grand Tour\" visits. As ancient statues were the pre-eminent souvenir of the Grand Tour, Blundell had strong competition from other collectors, both British nobility and European aristocrats, monarchs, and the Pope. His statues represent a typical cross-section of sculptures that would have decorated ancient Roman houses, villas, public spaces, and even tombs, although their precise origins are largely unknown. Most are likely to have come from Rome and at least one was found at Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. Although most of the works are likely to have been broken when found, in keeping with the taste of the period they were almost all restored. Because of their extensive reworking, the statues are today not simply archaeological specimens but rather, artistic palimpsests that are as much a product of the 18th century as of antiquity. Through them we can learn what antiquarians and collectors of the 18th century - a key period in the development of scientific archaeology as a discipline - thought about antiquity. Steeped in the work of such writers as Alexander Pope, an educated Englishman like Blundell sought a visual expression of a lost past. Restoration played a major role in creating that visual expression, and I pay close attention to the aims and methods by which the Ince restorations advanced an 18th century vision of the \"classical.\" The image of antiquity formed at this time has continued to exert a profound effect on how we see these pieces today. The book will be the first to examine the ideal sculpture of Ince Blundell Hall in nearly a century. In so doing it aims to rehabilitate the reputations of a collector and collection that have largely been been ignored by both art-lovers and scholars in post-war Britain.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1781383103"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781781383100"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Collectors and collecting"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZJUJkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZJUJkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZJUJkAEACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZJUJkAEACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ince_Blundell_Collection_of_Classica.html?hl=&id=ZJUJkAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZJUJkAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Xj4JYAAACAAJ", "etag": "eDa3jPoGids", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Xj4JYAAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Advanced Mouldmaking and Casting", "authors": ["Nick Brooks"], "publisher": "Crowood Press", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "The scope and potential of mouldmaking and casting is fascinating.

The work met with mixed reception, labeled vulgar by the conservative and quintessentially modern by the avant-garde. Following the artist's death in 1917, about 80 works were rescued, from his studio, and his heirs contracted with a foundry to case them in strictly limited editions, which have long since become prized pieces the world over. Documenting only four complete vintage sets of the bronzes, this lavishly illustrated catalogue presents for the first time stunning color images of the sculptures together with archival photographs taken of the original models found in Degas's studio in 1917-18 and historic photographs taken 50 years ago by Leonard von Matt. Included also are reprints of essays written in 1921 by a contemporary of the artist, by John Rewald to accompany relatively early exhibitions of Degas's work in the 50s and 70s, and by contemporary art historians, as well as appendices that include extensive exhibition, sales, and auction records, among other primary source materials.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0971640807"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780971640801"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 287, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=udBwQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=udBwQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=udBwQgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=udBwQgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Degas_Sculptures.html?hl=&id=udBwQgAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=udBwQgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZPNZcgAACAAJ", "etag": "qhmzF6Qf3GA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZPNZcgAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Public Sculpture of Outer South and West London", "authors": ["Fran Lloyd", "Helen Potkin", "Davina Thackara"], "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "This volume focuses on the public sculpture and monuments in the eight boroughs of outer south and west London. These stretch in a curve from the northernmost borough of Hillingdon, which borders the boroughs of Ealing and Hounslow, to Richmond that straddles the Thames, to the southern boroughs Kingston, Merton, Sutton, and Croydon. Of the 300 public monuments and sculptures detailed, over three quarters were originally commissioned by wealthy royal and aristocratic patrons to adorn their private residencies from the 16th to the 18th century. The wealth of works include architectural reliefs, statues, and garden ornaments such as fountains and urns produced by major metropolitan sculptors. Hampton Court Palace has architectural and garden sculpture by John Van Nost, Gabriel Caius Cibber, Grinling Gibbons and Edward Pierce. Cibber\u2019s Hercules pediment was perhaps Britain\u2019s first monumental pediment sculpture later imitated throughout the country. At Chiswick House Lord Burlington with his supreme knowledge of European sculpture employed Michael Rysbrack, Peter Scheemakers and Giovanni Battista Guelfi. The rise of new patrons in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and the desire to establish strong local identities resulted in a rich diversity of monuments, obelisks, bridges, fountains and clock towers. Municipal patronage replaced private commissions exemplified by Croydon\u2019s Town Hall, Library and Law Courts with its ambitious programme of decorative and symbolist sculpture emphasizing education, public order and other civic virtues. Education is also the theme of Hamo Thornycroft\u2019s statue of John Colet, the founder of St Paul\u2019s School. Early aviation at Croydon and Heathrow inspired much distinctive public sculpture and more recently prosperous commercial centres within the boroughs include the hundred-acre Stockley Business Park which has provided a wealth of contemporary work by major sculptors such as Stephen Cox, and William Pye, alongside works by Nigel Hall and David Mach commissioned by Kingston in partnership with Kingston University.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1846312256"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781846312250"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 404, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPNZcgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZPNZcgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZPNZcgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZPNZcgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Public_Sculpture_of_Outer_South_and_West.html?hl=&id=ZPNZcgAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZPNZcgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "NHJJAQAAIAAJ", "etag": "Ed4A/VIni7U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NHJJAQAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cesar", "subtitle": "anthologie", "authors": ["C\u00e9sar Baldaccini"], "publisher": "Fondation Cartier", "publishedDate": "2008", "description": "C\u00e9sar (19211998) came to prominence in the 1960s as part of the Nouveaux R\u00e9alistes group, with Arman, Klein, Raysse, Tinguely and others.

It is modest in scale, imaginative and ecological, painstakingly crafted and 'unheroic'. Friedman suggests a new direction in art: post video, post political/identity issues, post digital media, post ready-mades. Friedman works in a windowless studio (more like a playground-kitchen-laboratory) in rural Massachusetts, relentlessly inventing these startling ephemeral objects 'out of the stuff in my house': bits of Styrofoam, packing material, bottle tops, pencil shavings, plastic straws, dental floss, spaghetti, toothpicks, bubble gum. Some of his works are too delicate to move, existing solely in photographs and, above all, in the imagination. This is art that, to quote New York Timescritic Roberta Smith, 'raises wonderful questions about the making and seeing of art': about paying attention, about how we spend our time, and about the pleasures of small transformations producing sudden beauty. Solo exhibitions of Friedman's works have been held at The Museum of Modern Art in New York and at The Art Institute of Chicago. A major exhibition of his work, 'Tom Friedman: The Epic in the Everyday' toured in 2000-2 to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York and the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. American art critic Bruce Hainley examines the artist's work as a kind of giant self-portrait. Poet and novelist Dennis Cooper discusses with the artist such unexpected influences as contemporary electronic music. Guardianart critic Adrian Searle looks at the artist's work Untitled, 1993: a ring of plastic cups in a home-made Minimalist tradition. The Artist's Choices are The Dinner Party(1919) by Swiss writer Robert Walser, and the glossary to Info-Psychology(1975-6) by Timothy Leary, the cult psychologist who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. Facsimiles of the artist's notebooks and text works are published alongside an important interview by renowned curator Robert Storr.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UOM:39015047462331"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 159, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.3.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tOFPAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tOFPAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tOFPAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tOFPAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Tom_Friedman.html?hl=&id=tOFPAAAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tOFPAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
