The book introduces and explicates major works of science fiction literature by placing them in a series of contexts, using the history of science and technology, political and economic history, and cultural theory to develop the means for understanding the unique qualities of the genre. Luckhurst reads science fiction as a literature of modernity. His astute analysis examines how the genre provides a constantly modulating record of how human embodiment is transformed by scientific and technological change and how the very sense of self is imaginatively recomposed in popular fictions that range from utopian possibility to Gothic terror. This highly readable study charts the overlapping yet distinct histories of British and American science fiction, with commentary on the central authors, magazines, movements and texts from 1880 to the present day. It will be an invaluable guide and resource for all students taking courses on science fiction, technoculture and popular literature, but will equally be fascinating for anyone who has ever enjoyed a science fiction book.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780745628936"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0745628931"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 305, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F3JU3SJ5fDIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F3JU3SJ5fDIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F3JU3SJ5fDIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F3JU3SJ5fDIC&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Science_Fiction.html?hl=&id=F3JU3SJ5fDIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=F3JU3SJ5fDIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book introduces and explicates major works of science fiction literature by placing them in a series of contexts, using the history of science and technology, political and economic history, and cultural theory to develop the means for ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KEZxhkG5eikC", "etag": "jPOm60qfqFQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KEZxhkG5eikC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Science-fiction, the Early Years", "subtitle": "A Full Description of More Than 3,000 Science-fiction Stories from Earliest Times to the Appearance of the Genre Magazines in 1930 : with Author, Title, and Motif Indexes", "authors": ["Everett Franklin Bleiler"], "publisher": "Kent State University Press", "publishedDate": "1990", "description": "Contains author, title, and publishing information, and plot summaries", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0873384164"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780873384162"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 998, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Science_fiction_the_Early_Years.html?hl=&id=KEZxhkG5eikC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Contains author, title, and publishing information, and plot summaries"}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "55wUHXiay-gC", "etag": "pqeN14P2ado", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/55wUHXiay-gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction", "authors": ["Edward James", "Farah Mendlesohn"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2003-11-20", "description": "Science fiction is at the intersection of numerous fields.

Works of history that include fictional techniques are usually held in contempt, but works of fiction that include history are among the greatest of classics. Fiction claims to be able to convey its own unique kinds of truth. But unless a reader knows in advance whether a narrative is fictional or not, judgment can be frustrated and confused. In The Distinction of Fiction, Dorrit Cohn argues that fiction does present specific clues to its fictionality, and its own justifications. Indeed, except in cases of deliberate deception, fiction achieves its purposes best by exercising generic conventions that inform the reader that it is fiction. Cohn tests her conclusions against major narrative works, including Proust's A la Recherche du temps perdu, Mann's Death in Venice, Tolstoy's War and Peace, and Freud's case studies. She contests widespread poststructuralist views that all narratives are fictional. On the contrary, she separates fiction and nonfiction as necessarily distinct, even when bound together. An expansion of Cohn's Christian Gauss lectures at Princeton and the product of many years of labor and thought, The Distinction of Fiction builds on narratological and phenomenological theories to show that boundaries between fiction and history can be firmly and systematically explored.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801865220"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801865220"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Distinction_of_Fiction.html?hl=&id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In The Distinction of Fiction, Dorrit Cohn argues that fiction does present specific clues to its fictionality, and its own justifications."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "UEh7DwAAQBAJ", "etag": "5doveYAg0Qs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/UEh7DwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Testaments", "subtitle": "The Sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale", "authors": ["Margaret Atwood"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2019-09-10", "description": "** WINNER OF THE BOOKER PRIZE 2019 ** ** SUNDAY TIMES NO. 1 BESTSELLER ** Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian masterpiece, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, is a modern classic. Now she brings the iconic story to a dramatic conclusion in this riveting sequel. More than fifteen years after the events of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, the theocratic regime of the Republic of Gilead maintains its grip on power, but there are signs it is beginning to rot from within. At this crucial moment, the lives of three radically different women converge, with potentially explosive results. Two have grown up as part of the first generation to come of age in the new order. The testimonies of these two young women are joined by a third voice: a woman who wields power through the ruthless accumulation and deployment of secrets. As Atwood unfolds The Testaments, she opens up the innermost workings of Gilead as each woman is forced to come to terms with who she is, and how far she will go for what she believes. \u2018Dear Readers: Everything you\u2019ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book.

These stories took the form of letters of remission, documents narrated to royal notaries by admitted offenders who, in effect, stated their case for pardon to the king. Thousands of such stories are found in French archives, providing precious evidence of the narrative skills and interpretive schemes of peasants and artisans as well as the well-born. This book, by one of the most acclaimed historians of our time, is a pioneering effort to us the tools of literary analysis to interpret archival texts: to show how people from different stations in life shaped the events of a crime into a story, and to compare their stories with those told by Renaissance authors not intended to judge the truth or falsity of the pardon narratives, but rather to refer to the techniques for crafting stories. A number of fascinating crime stories, often possessing Rabelaisian humor, are told in the course of the book, which consists of three long chapters. These chapters explore the French law of homicide, depictions of \"hot anger\" and self-defense, and the distinctive characteristics of women's stories of bloodshed. The book is illustrated with seven contemporary woodcuts and a facsimile of a letter of remission, with appendixes providing several other original documents.

The work treats the appearance of major themes in characteristically Romantic versions, the power of Romantic discourse to reshape imaginative writing, and a series of crucial reactions to the impact of Romanticism on cultural life down to the present, both in Europe and in the New World. Through its combination of chapters on thematic, generic, and discursive features, Romantic Prose Fiction achieves a unique theoretical stance, by considering the opinions of primary Romantics and their successors not as guiding \u0093truths\u0094 by which to define the permanent \u0093meaning\u0094 of Romanticism, but as data of cultural history that shed important light on an evolving civilization.SPECIAL OFFER: 30% discount for a complete set order (5 vols.).The Romanticism series in the Comparative History of Literatures in European Languages is the result of a remarkable international collaboration. The editorial team coordinated the efforts of over 100 experts from more than two dozen countries to produce five independently conceived, yet interrelated volumes that show not only how Romanticism developed and spread in its principal European homelands and throughout the New World, but also the ways in which the affected literatures in reaction to Romanticism have redefined themselves on into Modernism. A glance at the index of each volume quickly reveals the extraordinary richness of the series' total contents. Romantic Irony sets the broader experimental parameters of comparison by concentrating on the myriad expressions of \u0093irony\u0094 as one of the major impulses in the Romantic philosophical and artistic revolution, and by combining cross-cultural and interdisciplinary studies with special attention also to literatures in less widely diffused language streams. Romantic Drama traces creative innovations that deeply altered the understanding of genre at large, fed popular imagination through vehicles like the opera, and laid the foundations for a modernist theater of the absurd. Romantic Poetry demonstrates deep patterns and a sharing of crucial themes of the revolutionary age which underlie the lyrical expression that flourished in so many languages and environments. Nonfictional Romantic Prose assists us in coping with the vast array of writings from the personal and intimate sphere to modes of public discourse, including Romanticism's own self-commentary in theoretical statements on the arts, society, life, the sciences, and more. Nor are the discursive dimensions of imaginative literature neglected in the closing volume, Romantic Prose Fiction, where the basic Romantic themes and story types (the romance, novel, novella, short story, and other narrative forms) are considered throughout Europe and the New World. This enormous realm is seen not just in terms of Romantic theorizing, but in the light of the impact of Romantic ideas and narration on later generations. As an aid to readers, the introduction to Romantic Prose Fiction explains the relationships among the volumes in the series and carries a listing of their tables of contents in an appendix. No other series exists comparable to these volumes which treat the entirety of Romanticism as a cultural happening across the whole breadth of the \u0093Old\u0094 and \u0093New\u0094 Worlds and thus render a complex picture of European spiritual strivings in the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, a heritage still very close to our age.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9027234566"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789027234568"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 733, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G8aokatYPsQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G8aokatYPsQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=G8aokatYPsQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=G8aokatYPsQC&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Romantic_Prose_Fiction.html?hl=&id=G8aokatYPsQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=G8aokatYPsQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In this volume a team of three dozen international experts presents a fresh picture of literary prose fiction in the Romantic age seen from cross-cultural and interdisciplinary perspectives."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "-5f0vQXcJG0C", "etag": "Garp9ou2/zo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/-5f0vQXcJG0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Critical Approaches to Fiction", "authors": ["Shiv Kumar Kumar", "Keith F.

Sign-solvability is part of a larger study which seeks to understand the special circumstances under which an algebraic, analytic or geometric property of a matrix can be determined from the combinatorial arrangement of the positive, negative and zero elements of the matrix. The large and diffuse body of literature connected with sign-solvability is presented as a coherent whole for the first time in this book, displaying it as a beautiful interplay between combinatorics and linear algebra.

History was at once powerful and vulnerable in the empiricist climate of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England, suspect because of its reliance on testimony, yet essential if empiricism were ever to move beyond natural philosophy. The Boundaries of Fiction shows how, in this time of historiographical instability, the British novel exploited analogies to history. Titles incorporating the term ?history,? pseudo-editors presenting pseudo-documentary ?evidence,? and narrative theorizing about historical truth were some of the means used to distinguish novels from the fictions of poetry and other literary forms. These efforts, Everett Zimmerman maintains, amounted to a critique of history's limits and pointed to the novel's power to transcend them. He offers rich analyses of texts central to the tradition of the novel, chiefly Clarissa, Tom Jones, and Tristram Shandy, and concludes with discussions of Sir Walter Scott's development of the historical novel and David Hume's philosophy of history. Along the way, Zimmerman refers to such other important historical figures as John Locke, Richard Bentley, William Wotton, and Edward Gibbon and engages contemporary thinkers, including Paul Ricoeur and Michel Foucault, who have addressed the philosophical and methodological issues of historical evidence and narrative.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801432510"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801432514"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 250, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WAAOfVKaUR0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WAAOfVKaUR0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WAAOfVKaUR0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WAAOfVKaUR0C&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Boundaries_of_Fiction.html?hl=&id=WAAOfVKaUR0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WAAOfVKaUR0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Focusing on canonical works by Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, Laurence Sterne, and others, this book explains the relationship between British fiction and historical writing when both were struggling to attain status and authority."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "p5qar3j-cx4C", "etag": "wEATVZdAT4g", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/p5qar3j-cx4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Musicalization of Fiction", "subtitle": "A Study in the Theory and History of Intermediality", "authors": ["Werner Wolf"], "publisher": "Rodopi", "publishedDate": "1999", "description": "This volume is a pioneering study in the theory and history of the imitation of music in fiction and constitutes an important contribution to current intermediality research. Starting with a comparison of basic similarities and differences between literature and music, the study goes on to provide outlines of a general theory of intermediality and its fundamental forms, in which a more specialized theory of the musicalization of (narrative) literature based on contemporary narratology and a typology of the forms of musico-literary intermediality are embedded. It also addresses the question of how to recognize a musicalized fiction when reading one and why Sterne's Tristram Shandy, contrary to what has been previously said, is not to be regarded as a musicalized fiction. In its historical part, the study explores forms and functions of experiments with the musicalization of fiction in English literature. After a survey of the major preconditions for musicalization - the increasing appreciation of music in 18th and 19th-century aesthetics and its main causes - exemplary fictional texts from romanticism to postmodernism are analyzed. Authors interpreted are De Quincey, Joyce, Woolf, A. Huxley, Beckett, Burgess and Josipovici. Whilst the limitations of a transposition of music into fiction remain apparent, experiments in this field yield valuable insights into mainly a-mimetic and formalist aesthetic tendencies in the development of more recent fiction as a whole and also show to what extent traditional conceptions of music continue to influence the use of this medium in literature. The volume is of relevance for students and scholars of English, comparative and general literature as well as for readers who take an interest in intermediality or interart research.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9042004576"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789042004573"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p5qar3j-cx4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 839.42, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 419.71, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&rdid=book-p5qar3j-cx4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 839420000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 419710000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Musicalization_of_Fiction-sample-pdf.acsm?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=p5qar3j-cx4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This volume is a pioneering study in the theory and history of the imitation of music in fiction and constitutes an important contribution to current intermediality research."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "1AM825Ny4v0C", "etag": "byaVNR2rC+o", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1AM825Ny4v0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Writing Genre Fiction", "subtitle": "A Guide to the Craft", "authors": ["H.

The problem was that, although I knew how to write and had received a number of awards for nonfiction works, I didn't know the how to write fiction. So, before putting fingers to keyboard I did a thorough search of the literature, which included reading numerous books and hundreds of website articles. What I discovered was that there simply wasn't one good source from which to learn the craft of writing genre fiction. \"Writing Genre Fiction: A Guide to the Craft\" is the book I was looking for when I set out on my quest to learn how to write fiction. It is an attempt to share what I learned from my research.

Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, \"Enigmas of Identity and Agency,\" deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, \"Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence,\" contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, \"Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism,\" looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813172811"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0813172810"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xIU9d6W3vEkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xIU9d6W3vEkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xIU9d6W3vEkC&pg=PA1&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xIU9d6W3vEkC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xIU9d6W3vEkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2469.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2469.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xIU9d6W3vEkC&rdid=book-xIU9d6W3vEkC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2469200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2469200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xIU9d6W3vEkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>fICtIon</b>. fIlm.

Over 1 million copies sold! Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: \u2022 make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); \u2022 overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; \u2022 design your environment to make success easier; \u2022 get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780735211308"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0735211302"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 17, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.10.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lFhbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lFhbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lFhbDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lFhbDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Atomic_Habits.html?hl=&id=lFhbDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lFhbDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "OdgPWk1Sq6YC", "etag": "GoR19lLjzg8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/OdgPWk1Sq6YC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Fiction & Diction", "authors": ["G\u00e9rard Genette"], "publisher": "Cornell University Press", "publishedDate": "1993", "description": "Litteraturens aspekter beskrevet ud fra forskellige indfaldsvinkler med udgangspunkt i bl. a.

The volume consists of four broadly themed sections, each divided into eleven chapters. Section I, \"Science Fiction as Genre,\" considers the internal history of SF literature, examining its characteristic aesthetic and ideological modalities, its animating social and commercial institutions, and itsrelationship to other fantastic genres. Section II, \"Science Fiction as Medium,\" presents a more diverse and ramified understanding of what constitutes the field as a mode of artistic and pop-cultural expression, canvassing extra-literary manifestations of SF ranging from film and television tovideogames and hypertext to music and theme parks. Section III, \"Science Fiction as Culture,\" examines the genre in relation to cultural issues and contexts that have influenced it and been influenced by it in turn, the goal being to see how SF has helped to constitute and define important(sub)cultural groupings, social movements, and historical developments during the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.

Drawing on texts that range from 18th-century female conduct books and contract theory to modern psychoanalytic case histories and theories of reading, Armstrong shows that the emergence of a particular form of female subjectivity capable of reigning over the household paved the way for the establishment of institutions which today are accepted centers of political power. Neither passive subjects nor embattled rebels, the middle-class women who were authors and subjects of the major tradition of British fiction were among the forgers of a new form of power that worked in, and through, their writing to replace prevailing notions of \"identity\" with a gender-determined subjectivity.

As a contemporary novelist, Fowles began as a modernist self-consciously aware of the various narratological problems that he encountered throughout his writings. In his most recent novel, A Maggot, however, he assumes the role of the postmodernist who not only subverts the tradition of narratology, but also poses a series of problems concerning history and politics. Throughout this study, Mahmoud Salami attempts to locate Fowles's fiction in the context of modern critical theory and narrative poetics. He provides a lively analysis of the ways in which Fowles deliberately deployed realistic historical narrative in order to subvert them from within the very conventions they seek to transgress, and he examines these subversive techniques and the challenges they pose to the tradition of narratology. Salami presents, for instance, a critique of the self-conscious narrative of the diary form in The Collector, the intertextual relations of the multiplicity of voices, the problems of subjectivity, the reader's position, the politics of seduction, ideology, and history in The Magus and The French Lieutenant's Woman. The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles's nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society. Indeed, Fowles emerges as a postmodernist novelist committed to the underprivileged, to social democracy, and to literary pluralism. This study clearly illustrates the fact that Fowles is a poststructuralist--let alone a postmodernist--in many ways: in his treatment of narratives, in mixing history with narrative fiction and philosophy, and in his appeal for freedom and for social and literary pluralism. It significantly contributes to a better understanding of Fowles's problematical narratives, which can only be properly understood if treated within the fields of modern critical theory, narratology, and the poetics of postmodernism.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "083863446X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780838634462"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 302, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EquizXeXb3kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EquizXeXb3kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EquizXeXb3kC&pg=PA199&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EquizXeXb3kC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EquizXeXb3kC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3743.26, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3743.26, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EquizXeXb3kC&rdid=book-EquizXeXb3kC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3743260000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3743260000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/John_Fowles_s_Fiction_and_the_Poetics_of-sample-epub.acsm?id=EquizXeXb3kC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/John_Fowles_s_Fiction_and_the_Poetics_of-sample-pdf.acsm?id=EquizXeXb3kC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EquizXeXb3kC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Twist end once and fasten AB to ab, CD to cd&quot;; in &quot;Autobiography: A Self- <br>\nRecorded <b>Fiction</b>,&quot; the narrator leaves actual spaces to be filled by the reader: <br>\nYou saw listen give me life in a manner of speaking.10 Thus in Mantissa Fowles <br>\nis making&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WaZv_aCGfcAC", "etag": "1+84Goe3oAk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WaZv_aCGfcAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Letters to a Fiction Writer", "authors": ["Frederick Busch"], "publisher": "W.

It offers a sample of major theories of fictional technique while emphasizing recent developments in literary criticism. The essays cover a variety of topics, including voice, point of view, narration, sequencing, gender, and race. Ten new selections address issues such as oral memory in African American fiction, temporality, queer theory, magical realism, interactive narratives, and the effect of virtual technologies on literature. For students and generalists alike, Essentials of the Theory of Fiction is an invaluable resource for understanding how fiction works. Contributors. M. M.

The chapters of this book move towards establishing appropriate readings that allow contemporary readers to negotiate unreality, a skill that the end of the millennium is making inevitably necessary. Such strategies have long been the preserve of literary and cultural study, and here a number of well-regarded scholars and some new to the field make their contribution to an area that has become increasingly important in recent years.

Randall Stevenson's important new analysis of the genre presents a lucid, comprehensive introduction to modernist fiction, covering a wide range of writers and works. Drawing on narrative theory and cultural history, Stevenson offers fresh insights into the work of such important modernists as Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, D.H. Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, Dorothy Richardson, May Sinclair, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce. In addition he discusses the work of Marcel Proust, an important figure in the development of modernism in Europe.

Elizabeth Ginway"], "publisher": "Bucknell University Press", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "\"Science fiction, because of its links to science and technology, is the consummate literary vehicle for examining the perception and cultural impact of the modernization process in Brazil. Because of the centrality of the role played by the military dictatorship (1964-85) in imposing industrialization and economic development policies on Brazil, this book examines the genre in the periods before, during, and after the dictatorship, encompassing the years 1960-2000. The analysis shows that a reading of Brazilian science fiction based on its use of paradigms of Anglo-American science fiction and myths of Brazilian nationhood provides a unique look into Brazil's modern metamorphosis as it finds itself on the periphery of the globalized world.\" \"The three periods studied here correspond roughly to the 1960s, the '70s, and he '80s to the present. The earliest group of authors produces mostly antitechnological, apolitical science fiction, as a way of affirming myths of Brazilian identity. Here, the deconstruction of myths of the feminine and of racial democracy provides the basis for the analysis of Brazil's notion of national identity. In the seventies, a second group of authors uses science fiction to protest the military regime, creating dystopian worlds in which the myths of Brazilian culture serve as touchstones to criticize various ills associated with urbanization, industrialization, and repression. In the analysis of these texts, the insights of ecofeminism are employed to demystify the conflation of the land with women found in the nostalgic construction of Brazilian identity characteristic of this period. The third group, emerging in the mideighties after the dictatorship, offers a more complex, postmodern view of Brazilian society, its continuing social problems, and the phenomenon of globalization. Reading these texts as allegories of modernization enriches the understanding of both the genre of science fiction and the experience of modernity itself.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

It is an impartial study that analyzes the stylistic excellence of South Asian fiction and the clearly emergent motifs of the writers, recognizing the value of the interplay of cultural differences and the need for resolution of those differences. The book begins with a discussion of the works of Indo-Caribbean novelists Samuel Selvon and V.S. Naipaul, author of A House for Mr. Biswas and The Enigma of Arrival, thereby establishing parallels between the immigration patterns of the South Asian diaspora who first emigrated to the Caribbean long before significant numbers of South Asians came to the United States. Next, the fiction of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (Heat and Dust), the non-fictional narratives of Ved Mehta (Face to Face), and the satire and social criticism of Bharati Mukherjee (Wife) and Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni (Sister of My Heart) are discussed. New literary voices such as those of Bapsi Sidhwa (An American Brat), Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, whose characters, plots and themes deal with universal human experiences, Akhil Sharma, Manil Suri and Samrat Upadhyay are studied for the new directions and new methods they offer. A sub-genre of young adult fiction is discovered in the novels of Dhan Gopal Mukerji, such as in his Gay-Neck: The Story of a Pigeon, and more recently in the works of Mitali Perkins and Indi Rana.

This volume-the only reference work devoted exclusively to African American fiction of the last thirty-five years-presents a wealth of factual and interpretive information about the major authors, texts, movements, and ideas that have shaped contemporary African American fiction. In more than 160 concise entries, arranged alphabetically, Dickson-Carr discusses the careers, works, and critical receptions of Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor, Jamaica Kincaid, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Leon Forrest, as well as other prominent and lesser-known authors. Each entry presents ways of reading the author's works, identifies key themes and influences, assesses the writer's overarching significance, and includes sources for further research. Dickson-Carr addresses the influence of a variety of literary movements, critical theories, and publishers of African American work. Topics discussed include the Black Arts Movement, African American postmodernism, feminism, and the influence of hip-hop, the blues, and jazz on African American novelists. In tracing these developments, Dickson-Carr examines the multitude of ways authors have portrayed the diverse experiences of African Americans. The Columbia Guide to Contemporary African American Fiction situates African American fiction in the social, political, and cultural contexts of post-Civil Rights era America: the drug epidemics of the 1980s and 1990s and the concomitant \"war on drugs,\" the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement, the struggle for gay rights, feminism, the rise of HIV/AIDS, and racism's continuing effects on African American communities. Dickson-Carr also discusses the debates and controversies regarding the role of literature in African American life. The volume concludes with an extensive annotated bibliography of African American fiction and criticism.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231510691"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231510691"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 280, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XG--8X3YDs4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XG--8X3YDs4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XG--8X3YDs4C&pg=PA29&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XG--8X3YDs4C&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Columbia_Guide_to_Contemporary_Afric.html?hl=&id=XG--8X3YDs4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Columbia_Guide_to_Contemporary_Afric-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XG--8X3YDs4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XG--8X3YDs4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A-Z Guide to Contemporary African American <b>Fiction</b> L Molefi Kete Asante, &quot;The <br>\nAfrocentric Idea in Education,&quot; The.

In particular, texts by such diverse authors as Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, Mary Robinson, Harriet Martineau, Olive Schreiner, Virginia Woolf, the French Feminists H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous and Monique Wittig, Margaret Cavendish, and Mich\u00e8le Roberts are analysed. This chronological in-depth reading of feminist texts is based on the interrelation of content, genre and discourse. The study provides the first analysis of the phenomenon of the gendering of genre and feminists' troubled involvement in \"theory\" as well as \"literature\". In this way, key questions concerning the emergence of feminism during the last four hundred years are presented in a new and revealing light; e.g., for what reason did Mary Wollstonecraft not only write her famous feminist treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, but also a novel in which she tests the arguments of her theoretical treatise by means of fiction? What is the significance of Virginia Woolf?s \"Novel-Essay\" The Pargiters, which seeks to connect theoretical and fictional parts by juxtaposing them?

These were the days of the youth of science fiction, when it was brash, raw and exciting: the days of the first great space operas by Edward Elmer Smith and Edmond Hamilton, through the cosmic thought variants by Murray Leinster, Jack Williamson and others to the early 1940s when John W. Campbell at Astounding did his best to nurture the infant genre into adulthood. Under him such major names as Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, A. E. van Vogt and Theodore Sturgeon emerged who, along with other such new talents as Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke, helped create modern science fiction.

Each of the essays examines a different aspect of the novelists' art as one uniquely astute critical mind observes them. The central issue Robert Heilman confronts--often by studying the novels in pairs--is how the novelist does what he does. Dealing with subjects as diverse as Charlotte Bronte, Henry James, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, and Evelyn Waugh, Heilman studies the workings of fiction from varied stances. He investigates the uses of the verbal medium and the several means by which a given theme is developed. As Heilman identifies and traces particular themes, he studies how parts are assembled into a whole. In addition, he explores particular generic types--like the picaresque, the gothic, the tragic--as they are used by a variety of novelists. Written by a gifted man of letters, The Workings of Fiction takes us inside the process of criticism. The book offers us an original and perceptive view of Under the Volcano as it offers of Pride and Prejudice or The Turn of the Screw. Each essay presents a fresh way of looking at and understanding these novels. This collection will be of interest to anyone who desires insight into the workings of fiction.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0826207871"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780826207876"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7JybFYxnp38C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7JybFYxnp38C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7JybFYxnp38C&pg=PA339&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=114&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7JybFYxnp38C&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Workings_of_Fiction.html?hl=&id=7JybFYxnp38C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7JybFYxnp38C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "There were, for instance, the Pamelas that resisted men, the Tom Joneses that <br>\ndid not resist women, and the Yoricks that resisted no vibrations, however minute, <br>\nof delight and pity\u2014mechanical imitations that crowded through <b>fiction</b> until&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "gZagxV4fY3MC", "etag": "QItXmHCrVt4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gZagxV4fY3MC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Fiction of Bhabani Bhattacharya", "authors": ["Kh.

The approach is philosophical: that is to say, the author offers an account of key concepts such as fictional truth, fictional characters, and fiction itself. The book argues that the concept of fiction can be explained partly in terms of communicative intentions, partly in terms of a condition which excludes relations of counterfactual dependence between the world and the text. This communicative model is then applied to the following problems: how can something be 'true in the story' without being explicitly stated in the text? In what ways does interpreting a fictional story depend upon grasping its author's intentions? Is there always a unique best interpretation of a fictional text? What is the correct semantics for fictional names? What is the nature of our emotional response to a fictional work? In answering these questions the author explores the complex interaction between author, reader, and text. This interaction requires the reader to construct a 'fictional author' - a character in the story whose personality, beliefs and emotional states must be interpreted if the reader is to grasp the meaning of the work.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521381274"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521381277"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d3Q6AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d3Q6AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=d3Q6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA182&dq=Fiction&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=d3Q6AAAAIAAJ&dq=Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Nature_of_Fiction.html?hl=&id=d3Q6AAAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=d3Q6AAAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Chapter 5 Emotion and the response to <b>fiction</b> We read novels not merely to find <br>\nout what is true in them , or to decide whether the author has done a decent job of <br>\nplot construction , or to study the characteristics of a certain genre .

Writing in a lively, informal style, two editors with extensive experience in a wide variety of fields--fiction and nonfiction, trade and reference, academic and commercial publishing--explain what editors in different jobs really do. The authors take the reader step by step through the editing process, from manuscript to bound book. They discuss the principles of sound editing and provide many specific examples of how to--and how not to--edit copy. They also give examples of how to deal tactfully with authors and show when editorial restraint is the best intervention. Editing Fact and Fiction is a book to be read, not just referred to. It will be an indispensable guide for anyone thinking about a career in book publishing, a valuable resource for working editors who want to enlarge their knowledge, and a useful tool for senior editors training staff.
