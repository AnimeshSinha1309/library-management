Subsequent evolution through the Bronze and Iron Ages up to our present technologically advanced society has hardly diminished the importance of wood. Today, its role as a source of paper products, furniture, building materials, and fuel is still of major significance. Wood consists of a mixture of polymers, often referred to as lignocellulose. The cellulose micro fibrils consist of an immensely strong, linear polymer of glucose. They are associated with smaller, more complex polymers composed of various sugars called hemicelluloses. These polysaccharides are embedded in an amorphous phenylpropane polymer, lignin, creating a remarkably strong com posite structure, the lignocellulosic cell wall. Wood also contains materials that are largely extraneous to this lignocellulosic cell wall. These extracellular substances can range from less than 1070 to about 35% of the dry weight of the wood, but the usual range is 2% -10%. Among these components are the mineral constituents, salts of calcium, potassium, sodium, and other metals, particularly those present in the soil where the tree is growing. Some of the extraneous components of wood are too insoluble to be ex tracted by inert solvents and remain to give extractive-free wood its color; very often these are high-molecular-weight polyphenolics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642740756"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642740758"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 1243, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-M1f9CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Natural_Products_of_Woody_Plants-sample-pdf.acsm?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=M1f9CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LgPyCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "UOtJn6dyzOM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LgPyCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Carbohydrates", "subtitle": "Structures, Syntheses and Dynamics", "authors": ["P.

The metal adds a third dimension to the planar aromatic compounds and coordination of a metal to an arene thus not only altering the reactivity of ring-carbons and substituents but also makes possible reactions that lead to chiral non-racemic products. This book, organized in nine chapters and written by leading scientists in the field provides the reader with an up-to-date treatise on the subject organized according to reaction type and use. It covers the wide spectrum of arene activation: from the electrophilic activation of h6-bound arene\u00ef\u2fec by p-Lewis acid metal complex fragments, to reactions of nucleophilic h2-coordinated arene complexes. The preparation of complexes is detailed, as are the scope, limitations and challenges of reactions in contemporary p-arene metal chemistry with special attention given to asymmetric transformations. The emphasis of the book is on transformations of interest to organic synthesis and on the use of the complexes as catalysts or as chiral ligands.

Their unique potential to self-renew and differentiate has turned them into an attractive model for the study of basic biological questions such as cell division, replication, transcription, cell fate decisions, and more. With embryonic stem (ES) cells that can generate each cell type in the mammalian body and adult stem cells that are able to give rise to the cells within a given lineage, basic questions at different developmental stages can be addressed. Importantly, both adult and embryonic stem cells provide an excellent tool for cell therapy, making stem cell research ever more pertinent to regenerative medicine. As the title The Cell Biology of Stem Cells suggests, our book deals with multiple aspects of stem cell biology, ranging from their basic molecular characteristics to the in vivo stem cell trafficking of adult stem cells and the adult stem-cell niche, and ends with a visit to regeneration and cell fate reprogramming.

Over the years into the present, its involvement in an ever increasing number of processes in all kinds of organisms has become apparent, and new and exciting vistas of its roles in such areas as the central nervous system, and in humoral functions, are appearing on the horizon. Although the biochemistry of this element has not been studied nearly as much as that of many others, a for midable amount of work has been carried out. It has thus been a challenge to produce a summary of what has been found that provides both breadth and depth. My goal has been to try to be as comprehensive as possible, within some limitations. I have tried to provide basic information and basic data that should continue to be useful for a long time. The goal has also been to interpret where we currently stand in our knowledge of the structure, function, regulation, and metabolism of Cu-dependent processes and sub stances, especially proteins. Thus, I have tried to make this a source book for historic as well as current information on all aspects of copper bio chemistry, and a summary of our current knowledge of copper-dependent proteins and processes. Most of the research on copper has been carried out on vertebrates, especially mammals. This has played a role in the organization of the book.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781475794328"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1475794320"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 526, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-8x4DCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Biochemistry_of_Copper-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8x4DCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Be9fgMzp4WwC", "etag": "dBLq8kje3Gs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Be9fgMzp4WwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Plant-Microbe Interactions", "authors": ["B.B.

Knowledge has accumulated on the mecha nisms of the microbial infection of plants, which can lead to either disease or resistance. The mechanisms developed by plants to interact with microbes, whether viruses, bacteria, or fungi, involve events that can lead to symbiotic association or to disease or tumor formation. Cell death caused by pathogen infection has been of great interest for many years because of its association with plant resistance. There appear to be two types of plant cell death associated with pathogen infection, a rapid hypersensitive cell death localized at the site of infection during an incompatible interaction between a resistant plant and an avirulent pathogen, and a slow, normosensitive plant cell death that spreads beyond the site of infection during some compatible interactions involving a susceptible plant and a virulent, necrogenic pathogen. Plants possess a number of defense mechanisms against infection, such as (i) production of phytoalexin, (ii) formation of hydrolases, (iii) accumulation of hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein and lignin deposition, (iv) production of pathogen-related proteins, (v) produc tion of oligosaccharides, jasmonic acid, and various other phenolic substances, and (vi) production of toxin-metabolizing enzymes. Based on these observations, insertion of a single suitable gene in a particular plant has yielded promising results in imparting resistance against specific infection or disease. It appears that a signal received after microbe infection triggers different signal transduction pathways.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306456788"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306456787"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 440, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Plant_Microbe_Interactions.html?hl=&id=Be9fgMzp4WwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Plant_Microbe_Interactions-sample-epub.acsm?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Plant_Microbe_Interactions-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "SuXi2WtHnwQC", "etag": "RUrEpAy+7/I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/SuXi2WtHnwQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Guide to Protein Isolation", "authors": ["C.

Neverthelens, it is important to strike a level of \"fundamentalness\" appropriate to the task in hand. For example, an in-depth study of the mechanics of motor cars would tell one nothing about the dynamics of traffic. Traffic exists on a different \"level\" - it is dependent upon the existence of motor vehicles but the physics and mathematics of traffic can be adequately addressed by considering motor vehicles as mobile \"blobs\", with no consideration of how they become mobile. To start a discourse on traffic with a consideration of the mechanics of motor vehicles would thus be inappropropriate. In writing this volume, I have wrestled with the question of the appropriate level at which to address the physics underlying many of the techniques used in protein isolation. I have tried to strike a level as would be used by a mechanic (with perhaps a slight leaning towards an engineer) - i.e. a practical level, offering appropriate insight but with minimal mathematics.

There are also proce dures for induction of mutants by physical and chemical agents, and for iso lation of particular types of mutants, such as to temperature sensitivity, for increased frequency of mutations, for mutations in the mitochondrial genome, both to the petite colonie form and to resistance to antibiotics, for mutations in that part of the yeast genome controlling the glycolytic cycle, and numerous others. Mapping of mutations is discussed briefly, though this aspect of yeast genetics is probably one which should not be undertaken until the investigator has gained a certain amount of experience in the field. How ever, as is pointed out in the pertinent part of the manual, the task of mapping has been tremendouslysimplified by the availability from the Yeast Genetics Stock Center at the University of California at Berkeley of a set of auxo trophic strains designed to permit mapping of most unknown genes with a minimum number of crosses and tetrad analyses.

However, not many sources are available for the pharmaceutical develop ment scientist and other personnel responsible for the commercialization of the finished dosage forms of these new biopharmaceuticals and other products from biotechnology. This text will help to fill this gap. Once active biopharmaceutical molecules are candidates for clinical trial investigation and subsequent commercialization, a number of other activities must take place while research and development on these molecules continues.

It is not only a matter of apparent simplicity in terms of biochemistry, biophysics and physiology but more likely this cell offers a great possibility for elucidating some basic problems in the process of aging. In fact, nowadays, it is possible to follow individual cells all along their life span in circulation, it is possible to obtain these cells when young, middle aged or old and it is possible to obtain cells from individuals of defined ages and transfuse them into compatible recipients to investigate the role of the environment where the cell lives, and finally it is possible to easily manipulate the red cell content in terms of enzymatic activities and/or metabolic properties to investigate the possible effect of these manipulations on cell survival. This book, Red Blood Cell Aging, is based on a symposium held in Urbino, Italy, at the end of 1990 and examines the impact of age on the membrane, metabolism, structural and enzymatic proteins of mammalian erythrocytes. The various contributions to this symposium not only described those processes of aging which affect the cell but also provided a nearly complete picture of the event{s} and mechanism{s} that every day permits to recognize among 25 trillion circulating red cells {in an average adult} that 1 percent that have reached the end of their 120 day life span in circulation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468459852"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468459856"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-4vkICAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Red_Blood_Cell_Aging-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4vkICAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Z_LiBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "yDTKQ4SM6+0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Z_LiBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules", "authors": ["G.D.

The importance of computational function prediction is increasing because more and more large scale biological data, including genome sequences, protein structures, protein-protein interaction data, microarray expression data, and mass spectrometry data, are awaiting biological interpretation. Traditionally when a genome is sequenced, function annotation of genes is done by homology search methods, such as BLAST or FASTA. However, since these methods are developed before the genomics era, conventional use of them is not necessarily most suitable for analyzing a large scale data. Therefore we observe emerging development of computational gene function prediction methods, which are targeted to analyze large scale data, and also those which use such omics data as additional source of function prediction. In this book, we overview this emerging exciting field. The authors have been selected from 1) those who develop novel purely computational methods 2) those who develop function prediction methods which use omics data 3) those who maintain and update data base of function annotation of particular model organisms (E. coli), which are frequently referred", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400708815"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400708815"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 310, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.7.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdid=book-UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-epub.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "PkEGCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "NM/uRkG9SdE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/PkEGCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Food Hydrocolloids", "subtitle": "Structures, Properties, and Functions", "authors": ["K.

Food hydrocolloids have been widely used for controlling in various food products their viscoelasticity, emulsification, gelation, dispersion, thickening and many other functions. An international journal, FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS, launched in 1986 has published a number of stimulating papers, and established an active forum for promoting the interaction between academics and industrialists and for combining basic scientific research with industrial development. Although there have been various research groups in many food processing areas in Japan, such as fish paste (kamaboko, surimi), soybean curd (tofu), agar jelly dessert, kuzu starch jelly, kimizu (Japanese style mayonnaise), their activities have been conducted in isolation of one another. The interaction between the various research groups operating in the various sectors has been weak. Symposia on food hydrocolloids have been organised on several occasions in Japan since 1985. Professor Glyn O. Phillips, the Chief Executive Editor of FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS, suggested to us that we should organise an international conference on food hydrocolloids.

These considerations, however, were not the reason for writing this book although it is hoped that it will also be helpful in this respect. The interaction of radiation with biological systems is such an interesting research objective that to my mind no special justification is needed to pursue these problems. The combination of physics, chemistry and biology presents on one hand a fascinating challenge to the student, on the other, it may lead to insights which are not possible if the dif ferent subjects remain clearly separated. Special problems of radiation biology have quite often led to new approaches in physics (or vice versa), a recent example is \"microdosimetry\" (chapter 4). Biological radiation a9tion comprises all levels of biological organization. It starts with the absorption in essential atoms and molecules and ends with the development of cancer and genetic hazards to future generations. The structure of the book reflects this. Beginning with physical and chemical fundamentals, it then turns to a description of chemical and subcellular systems. Cellular effects form a large part since they are the basis for understanding all further responses.

GAPDH function may provide insight into anesthesia. Furthermore, GAPDH is highly conserved meaning that the protein found in microorganisms, such as pathogens, remained relatively unchanged in evolution. Pathogens use GAPDH as a virulence factor, offering a unique challenge in developing anti-microbial agents that target this protein.

In most of the books, the objective type questions judge the students on the basis of their ability to memorize, because of the way they are formulated. It is important to be able to remember the year of historical events, the scientists involved and who named what to make one remember the landmark contributions of the people on a particular subject. Along with these kinds of questions, majority of the questions in this book have been designed to assess the candidate's understanding of the subject. It is perhaps for the first time where questions have four to six choice statements, which are to be understood to find the right answer. One has to think and remember what he has learnt to be able to answer these questions. There are some books on objective type questions on the subject of Plant Breeding and a very few on Genetics but there is hardly any book, which deals with Tissue Culture, Biotechnology, Biochemistry or Forestry. All these subjects are related as many postgraduate students of Genetics and Plant Breeding take Biotechnology as a minor subject whereas those of Biotechnology take Biochemistry or Genetics and Plant Breeding as a minor subject.

At this meeting the recent developments in the field of tryptophan research were presented by leading researchers from all over the world in 81 oral and 48 poster contri butions. Research on tryptophan and its derivatives provides an inexhaustible subject. At the conference we tried to compose a multifacetted picture of the recent investiga tions through contributions from the major disciplines involved. Thus, we tried to strike a balance between basic research topics and clinical, nutritional or industrial applica tions. We offered workshops on tryptophan (in sleep and mood), melatonjn, IDO-acti vation and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) as a platform for intensive discussion for the participants. In these proceedings many contributions are multidisciplinary and have practical or theoretical implications for different research fields.

Cell biological approaches, advanced genetics, biophysics and biochemistry have greatly contributed to an increase in our knowledge in this field.lt is obvious however, that the three major membrane constituents - lipids, proteins and carbohydrates- are studied, in most cases separately and that a coherent overview of the various aspects of membrane biogenesis is not readily available. The NATO Advanced Study Institute on \"New Perspectives in the Dynamics of Assembly of Biomembranes\" intended to provide such an overview: it was set up to teach students and specialists the achievements obtained in the various research areas and to try and integrate the numerous aspects of membrane assembly into a coherent framework. The articles in here reflect this. Statting with detailed contributions on phospholipid structure, dynamics, organization and biogenesis, an up to date overview of the basic, lipidic backbone of biomembranes is given. Extensive progress is made in the research on membrane protein biosynthesis. In particular the post- and co-translational modification processes of proteins, the mechanisms of protein translocation and the sorting mechanisms which are necessary to direct proteins to their final, intra - or extracellular destination have been characterized in detail. Modern genetic approaches were indispensable in this research area: gene cloning, hybrid protein construction, site directed mutagenesis and sequencing techniques elucidated many functional aspects of specific nucleic acid and amino acid sequences.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642731846"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642731848"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 477, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Membrane_Biogenesis-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9lXPYobZkxQC", "etag": "KfOLTbSvALw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9lXPYobZkxQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Innate Immunity of Plants, Animals and Humans", "authors": ["Holger Heine"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2007-12-07", "description": "This book has been cunningly designed to provide an overview of our current knowledge about the innate immune systems of these three types of organisms.

The motivation that drove us to organize this meeting was the feeling that distinct groups of researchers, active in key areas of modern immunology, sometimes fail to communicate with each other simply because of different traditional affiliations. Yet it is urgent that \"molecular\" and \"cellular\" people cooperate more if immunology is to continue the exportation of new concepts to other disciplines. In fact, the deep meaning of molecule-molecule and cell-cell interaction, the generation of signals and their effective transmission which results in elicitation, control or suppression of responses cannot be unraveled without the experts on antibody structure or complement activation sharing their views with the experts on T cell, B cell and macrophage membrane receptors as well as the experts on factors that carry the information released by these cells. Whether the meeting was scientifically fruitful, the reader can judge after having digested these pages. We, the organizers, are not sure whether the optimal amount\u00b7of interaction had taken place; especially considering how hard it is to overcome the scientist's catch 22: You have to know something quite well before you get really interested in it.

The wide array and incredible variety of environments found across the Arabian peninsula are truly dramatic; tro- cal coastal plains are found bordering up against barren sandy deserts, high mountain plateaus are deeply incised by ancient river courses. As the birthplace of Islam, the recent history of the region is well documented and thoroughly studied. However, legendary explorers such as T.E. Lawrence, Wilfred Thesiger, and St. John Philby discovered hints of a much deeper past during their travels across the subcontinent. Drawn to Arabia by the magnifcent solitude of its vast sand seas, these intrepid adventurers learned from the Bedouin how to penetrate its deserts and returned with stirring accounts of lost civilizations among the wind-swept dunes. We now know that, prior to recorded history, Arabia housed countless peoples living a variety of lifestyles, including some of the world\u2019s earliest pastoralists, c- munities of incipient farmers, fshermen dubbed the \u201cIchthyophagi\u201d by ancient Greek geographers, and Paleolithic big-game hunters who were among the frst humans to depart their ancestral homeland in Africa. In fact, some archaeological investigations indicate that Arabia was inhabited by early hominins extending far back into the Early Pleistocene, perhaps even into the Late Pliocene.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "904812719X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789048127191"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 312, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&rdid=book-x6o4XLIKN0UC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Evolution_of_Human_Populations_in_Ar-sample-epub.acsm?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Evolution_of_Human_Populations_in_Ar-sample-pdf.acsm?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "IQKYbUsrtZ4C", "etag": "PHaNdTfVdPE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IQKYbUsrtZ4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Regulation of Gene Expression", "authors": ["Gary H.

Many excellent books and reviews exist that examine the experimental methodology employed in specific areas of molecular biology and regulation of gene expression. However, we have noticed a lack of books, especially textbooks, that provide an overview of the rationale and general experimental approaches used to examine chemically or disease-mediated alterations in gene expression in mammalian systems. For example, it has been difficult to find appropriate texts that examine specific experimental goals, such as proving that an increased level of mRNA for a given gene is attributable to an increase in transcription rates. Regulation of Gene Expression: Molecular Mechanisms is intended to serve as either a textbook for graduate students or as a basic reference for laboratory personnel. Indeed, we are using this book to teach a graduate-level class at The Pennsylvania State University. For more details about this class, please visit http://moltox. cas. psu. edu and select \u201cCourses. \u201d The goal for our work is to provide an overview of the various methods and approaches to characterize possible mechanisms of gene regulation.

Although nanoparticulate systems are of significant interest in various scientific and technological areas, there is little known about the safety of these nanoscale objects. It has now been established that the surfaces of nanoparticles are immediately covered by biomolecules (e.g. proteins, ions, and enzymes) upon their entrance into a biological medium. This interaction with the biological medium modulates the surface of the nanoparticles, conferring a \u201cbiological identity\u201d to their surfaces (referred to as a \u201ccorona\u201d), which determines the subsequent cellular/tissue responses. The new interface between the nanoparticles and the biological medium/proteins, called \u201cbio-nano interface,\u201d has been very rarely studied in detail to date, though the interest in this topic is rapidly growing. In this book, the importance of the physiochemical characteristics of nanoparticles for the properties of the protein corona is discussed in detail, followed by comprehensive descriptions of the methods for assessing the protein-nanoparticle interactions. The advantages and limitations of available corona evaluation methods (e.g. spectroscopy methods, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and differential centrifugal sedimentation) are examined in detail, followed by a discussion of the possibilities for enhancing the current methods and a call for new techniques. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of protein-nanoparticle interaction phenomena are explored and discussed, with a focus on the biological impacts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642375552"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642375553"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 86, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-7blAAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Nanoparticle_Interactions-sample-epub.acsm?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Nanoparticle_Interactions-sample-pdf.acsm?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Gv3JipuhSdMC", "etag": "00czvxuhKw8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Gv3JipuhSdMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Echinodermata", "authors": ["Valeria Matranga"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2006-03-30", "description": "Members of the phylum Echinodermata are among the most familiar marine invertebrates.

Michaelson, convinced me that studying the biochemistry of ocular tissues would be a rewarding pursuit. I hastened to explain that I knew nothing about the subject, since relatively few basic biochemical studies on ocular tissues had appeared in the world literature. Professor Michaelson assured me, however, that two books on eye biochemistry had already been written. One of them, a beautiful monograph by Arlington Krause ( 1934) of Johns Hopkins Hospital, is we II worth reading even today for its historical perspective. The other, published 22 years later, was written by Antoinette Pirie and Ruth van Heyningen ( 1956), whose pioneering achievements in eye biochemistry at the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology in Oxford, England are known throughout the eye research community and beyond. To their credit are classical investigations on retinal, corneal, and lens biochemistry, beginning in the 1940s and continuing for many decades thereafter. Their important book written in 1956 on the Biochemistry of the Eye is a volume that stood out as a landmark in this field for many years. In recent years, however, a spectacular amount of new information has been gener ated in ocular biochemistry. Moreover, there is increasing specialization among investiga tors in either a specific field of biochemistry or a particular ocular tissue.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306436337"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306436338"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 476, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OnBkqpt4BmEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OnBkqpt4BmEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OnBkqpt4BmEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OnBkqpt4BmEC&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Biochemistry_of_the_Eye.html?hl=&id=OnBkqpt4BmEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Biochemistry_of_the_Eye-sample-epub.acsm?id=OnBkqpt4BmEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Biochemistry_of_the_Eye-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OnBkqpt4BmEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OnBkqpt4BmEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vBnSBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "xdo7XlshbBk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vBnSBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Density Functional Methods in Chemistry", "authors": ["Jan K.

With this book, the editors assert that the density functional (DF) method satisfies these goals and has come into its own as an advanced method of computational chemistry. The wealth of applications presented in the book, ranging from solid state sys tems and polymers to organic and organo-metallic molecules, metallic clus ters, and biological complexes, prove that DF is becoming a widely used computational tool in chemistry. Progress in the methodology and its imple mentation documented by the contributions in this book demonstrate that DF calculations are both accurate and efficient. In fact, the results of DF calculations may pleasantly surprise many chem ists. Even the simplest approximation of DF, the local spin density method (LSD), yields molecular structures typical of ab initio correlated methods. The next level of theory, the nonlocal spin density method, predicts the energies of molecular processes within a few kcallmol or less. Like the Hartree-Fock (HF) and configuration interaction (CI) methods, the DF method is based only on fundamental physical constants. Therefore, it does not require semiempirical parameters and can be applied to any molecular system and to metallic phases. However, DF's greatest advantage is that it can be applied to much larger systems than those approachable by tradition al ab initio methods, especially when compared with correlated ab initio methods.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461231363"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461231361"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 443, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-vBnSBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Density_Functional_Methods_in_Chemistry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EWULw650QA8C", "etag": "qgfrgRtZ7Jw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EWULw650QA8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biosensors and Their Applications", "authors": ["Victor C.

It was my intention that this manual would make the initial steps in the discovery process less time consuming and less intimidating. This book is not meant to be read from cover to cover. The expanded Table of Contents and the index should help locate what you are seeking. My aim was to provide practically oriented information that will assist the experimentalist in benchtop problem solving. The appendices are filled with diverse information gleaned from catalogs, handbooks, and manuals that are presented in a distilled fashion designed to save trips to the library and calls to technical service representatives. The user is encouraged to expand on the tables and charts to fit individual experimental situations.

Efforts have been concentrated on the measurement of the expression of RNA transcripts. In an analogy to the genome, the term \"transcriptome\" was created to refer to the complete set of RNAs in a cell type or tissue in a particular situation. Transcriptomics is the science that studies this issue and it is a branch of functional genomics. Transcriptomics in Heath and Disease provides a comprehensive overview of the science of transcriptomics initially in health, focusing on the concept of the transcriptome and the main methods to evaluate it. The authors discuss the concept and use of gene expression signatures and transcriptional biomarkers in normal development and diseased tissues and organs. As the transcriptome changes depending on the pathology, there is also a focus on the variations in the gene expression in different diseases such as autoimmune, inflammation, cancer and infections.

Any treatment of plant analysis must make use of these new methods. Developments have been so fast and the methods so powerful that the editors of Modern Methods of Plant Analysis have now decided to rename the series Molecular Methods ofPlant Analysis. This will not change the general aims of the series, but best describes the thrust and content of the series as we go forward into the new millennium. This does not mean that all chapters a priori deal only with the methods of molecular biology, but rather that these methods are to be found in many chapters together with the more traditional methods of analysis which have seen recent advances. The numbering of the volumes of the series therefore continues on from 20, which is the most recently published volume under the title Modern Methods ofPlant Analysis. As indicated for previous volumes, the methods to be found in Molecular Methods ofPlantAnalysis are described critically, with hints as to their limitations, references to original papers and authors being given, and the chapters written so that there is little need to consult other texts to carry out the methods of analysis described.

In Signal Transduction and the Gasotransmitters: NO, CO, and H2S in Biology and Medicine, a panel of distinguished researchers and clinicians review the biological and biomedical aspects of gasotransmitters, emphasizing their signaling transduction mechanisms in general, and ion channel regulation in particular. The authors discuss the endogeneous metabolism and regulation of gasotransmitters, their toxicological profiles and biological actions, and their interactions in terms of their production and effects. The physiological roles of NO, CO, and H2S in the regulation of the cardiovascular, neuronal, and gastrointestinal systems, as well as of cell metabolism, are also reviewed, along with the interaction of the gastrotransmitters with KATP,KCa voltage-gated Ca2+, voltage-gated Na+, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Included in the array of different mechanisms for the interaction of NO, CO, and H2S are channel phosphorylation, S-nitrosylation, carboxylation, sulfuration, and altered cellular redox status. The authors also offer guidance and suggestions for exploring and further characterizing other still unknown gasotransmitters.

Accordingly, the olfactory system has evolved complex repertoires of receptors to face these problems. Although the sense of taste has less far-reaching tasks, they are every bit as essential for the animals well-being, allowing it to reject toxic materials and to select nutritionally valuable food. The last decade has seen a massive advance in understanding the molecular logic of chemosensory information processing, beyond that already achieved in the rst few years following Linda Bucks discovery of odorant receptors. Shortly afterwards, the major principles of olfactory representation had been established in mammals as the one neuron/ one receptor rule and the convergence of neurons, which express the same receptor, onto individual modules in the olfactory bulb. In recent years, such studies have been extended to lower vertebrates, including shes and other phyla, i. e. , arthropods, worms, and insects, showing both the general validity of these concepts and some exceptions to the rule. In parallel, hallmarks of the molecular logic of taste sensation have been deciphered and found to differ in interesting ways from those of smell sensation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540699198"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540699194"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 262, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 18526, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 18526, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&rdid=book-EnmrDv1cMVkC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18526000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18526000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chemosensory_Systems_in_Mammals_Fishes_a-sample-epub.acsm?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chemosensory_Systems_in_Mammals_Fishes_a-sample-pdf.acsm?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FSY_DwAAQBAJ", "etag": "z8CxWnxECuc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FSY_DwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "DJ-1/PARK7 Protein", "subtitle": "Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Cancer and Oxidative Stress-Induced Diseases", "authors": ["Hiroyoshi Ariga", "Sanae M.

The DJ-1 gene was first found to be a novel oncogene in 1997 and later, in 2003, also found to be a causative gene for a familial form of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), park7. The DJ-1 gene is therefore the first gene discovered that is known to cause cancer and neurodenegerative diseases, including PD. The research field has expanded as the research has developed. Thus this volume begins with a general introduction of DJ-1, and explains the history and research development to understand the following chapters. Those chapters present the roles of DJ-1 in various oxidative stress-related diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer, diabetes, and fertility. Moreover, several chapters present evidence that DJ-1 is useful for therapeutic strategies against these diseases. The reader will discover that DJ-1 is a promising protein both for basic cell biology and for the mechanism and therapy for oxidative stress-related diseases.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789811065835"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9811065837"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FSY_DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/DJ_1_PARK7_Protein-sample-epub.acsm?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/DJ_1_PARK7_Protein-sample-pdf.acsm?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FSY_DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FDz2DQAAQBAJ", "etag": "ssqL/SeALhg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FDz2DQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "From Matter to Life", "subtitle": "Information and Causality", "authors": ["Sara Imari Walker", "Paul C.

Neurological and cardiovascular abnormalities occur in patients with severe genetic hyperhomocysteinemia and lead to premature death due to vascular complications. Although it is considered a non-protein amino acid, studies over the past dozen years have discovered mechanisms by which homocysteine becomes a component of proteins. Homocysteine-containing proteins lose their normal biological function and become auto-immunogenic and pro-thrombotic. In this book, the author, a pioneer and a leading contributor to the field, describes up-to date studies of the biological chemistry of homocysteine-containing proteins, as well as pathological consequences and clinical implications of their formation. This is a comprehensive account of the broad range of basic science and medical implications of homocysteine-containing proteins for health and disease. \u200b", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783709114100"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3709114101"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 166, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&rdid=book-iqTgV_Imw0UC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Homocysteine_in_Protein_Structure_Functi-sample-epub.acsm?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Homocysteine_in_Protein_Structure_Functi-sample-pdf.acsm?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y0YyBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "zlcZ07tHJ6A", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y0YyBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Confocal Microscopy for Biologists", "authors": ["Alan R.

Confocal microscopy has now become an important research tool, with a large number of new fluorescent dyes becoming available in the past few years, for probing your pet structure or molecule within fixed or living cell or tissue sampies. Many of the people interested in using confocal microscopy to further their research do not have a background in microscopy or even cell biology and so not only do they find considerable difficulty in obtaining satisfactory results with a confocal microscope, but they may be mislead by how data is being presented. This book is intended to teach you the basic concepts ofmicroscopy, fluorescence, digital imaging and the principles of confocal microscopy so that you may take full advantage ofthe excellent confocal microscopes now available. This book is also an excellent reference source for information related to confocal microscopy for both beginners and the more advanced users. For example, do you need to know the optimal pinhole size for a 63x 1. 4 NA lens? Do you need to know the fluorescence emission spectrum of Alexa 568?

This volume begins with chapters specifically addressing crops of major global importance, such as soybeans, rice, and sugar cane. It continues with a second important focus, agroforestry, and describes the use and promise of both legume trees with their rhizobial symbionts and other nitrogen-fixing trees with their actinorhizal colonization. An over-arching theme of all chapters is the interaction of the plants and trees with microbes and this theme allows other aspects of soil microbiology, such as interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the impact of soil-stress factors on biological nitrogen fixation, to be addressed. Furthermore, a link to basic science occurs through the inclusion of chapters describing the biogeochemically important nitrogen cycle and its key relationships among nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification. The volume then provides an up-to-date view of the production of microbial inocula, especially those for legume crops.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "140203542X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402035425"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 350, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dicDrU338X4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dicDrU338X4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dicDrU338X4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dicDrU338X4C&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Nitrogen_Fixation_in_Agriculture_Forestr.html?hl=&id=dicDrU338X4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nitrogen_Fixation_in_Agriculture_Forestr-sample-epub.acsm?id=dicDrU338X4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nitrogen_Fixation_in_Agriculture_Forestr-sample-pdf.acsm?id=dicDrU338X4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dicDrU338X4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "BZ3hBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "4E64EUgfoZs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BZ3hBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Glycoimmunology", "authors": ["Azita Alavi", "John S.

Between 1961 and 1966 my colleagues and I deciphered the genetic code in Escherichia coli and showed that the genetic code is the same in E. coli, Xenopus laevis, and guinea pig tissues. These results showed that the code has been c- served during evolution and strongly suggested that the code appeared very early during biological evolution, that all forms of life on earth descended from a c- mon ancestor, and thus that all forms of life on this planet are related to one another. The problem of biological time was solved by encoding information in DNA and retrieving the information for each new generation, for it is easier to make a new organism than it is to repair an aging, malfunctioning one. Subsequently, small modi?cations of the standard genetic code were found in certain organisms and in mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA only encodes about 10\u201313 proteins, so some modi?cations of the genetic code are tolerated that pr- ably would be lethal if applied to the thousands of kinds of proteins encoded by genomic DNA.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0387893822"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780387893822"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 466, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=110&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13924, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13924, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&rdid=book-8cSZpPWXoqIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13924000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13924000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Recoding_Expansion_of_Decoding_Rules_Enr-sample-epub.acsm?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Recoding_Expansion_of_Decoding_Rules_Enr-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8cSZpPWXoqIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "dF7EsvdaTbgC", "etag": "rIz8k4ByG9o", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dF7EsvdaTbgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Pesticide Protocols", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 L.

In Pesticide Protocols, expert researchers-who have each perfected the techniques they write about-describe in step-by-step detail robust methods for the detection of pesticide compounds or their metabolites, techniques that are highly useful in food, environmental, and biological monitoring, and in studies of exposure via food, water, air, and the skin or lungs. The methods range from gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection and other classic detectors, to capillary electrophoresis and immunochemical or radioimmunoassay techniques. The authors apply these broad-ranging techniques to the analysis of several families of pesticides, to pesticide residues in vegetables, to pesticides in water and air, and to pesticide exposure. The authors have focused on extraction and cleanup procedures in order to develop and optimize more fully automated and miniaturized methods, including solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and on-line tandem liquid chromatography trace enrichment, among others. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Biotechnology series format, each offering step-by-step laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principles behind the technique, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls.

Also most of the tools employed nowadays by biotechnologists are of bacterial (or bacteriophage) origin and the playground for most of the DNA manipulations still remains within bacteria. The relative simplicity of the bacterial cell, the short gene- tion times, the well defined and inexpensive culturing conditions which characterize bacteria and the auto-catalytic process whereby a wealth of in-depth information has been accumulated throughout the years have significantly contributed to generate a large number of knowledge-based, reliable and exploitable biological systems. The subtle relationships between phages and their hosts have produced a large amount of information and allowed the identification and characterization of a number of components which play essential roles in fundamental biological p- cesses such as DNA duplication, recombination, transcription and translation. For instance, to remain within the topic of this book, two important players in the or- nization of the nucleoid, FIS and IHF, have been discovered in this way.

Thirty-one chapters, authored by 58 international experts, provide a solid foundation of the basic theory, as well as of the application of the rich information contained in the Chl a fluorescence signal as it relates to photosynthesis and plant productivity. Although the primary photochemical reactions of photosynthesis are highly efficient, a small fraction of absorbed photons escapes as Chl fluorescence, and this fraction varies with metabolic state, providing a basis for monitoring quantitatively various processes of photosynthesis. The book explains the mechanisms with which plants defend themselves against environmental stresses (excessive light, extreme temperatures, drought, hyper-osmolarity, heavy metals and UV). It also includes discussion on fluorescence imaging of leaves and cells and the remote sensing of Chl fluorescence from terrestrial, airborne, and satellite bases.

For a group of elements which occur in only trace amounts biologically, and which have no known metabolic role, the lanthanides have spawned a surprisingly large biochemicalliterature. Se rious interest in the biochemical properties ofthese elements can be traced to concerns about the safety of radioactive lanthanides toward the end of World War 11. As recent events at Chernobyl indicate, this concern re mains topical. However, the literature on lanthanide biochemistry pre dates the atomic era, beginning with sporadic, medically motivated studies in the latter part of the 19th century. Much of the present biochemical activity involving the lanthanides centers around their ability to provide 2 important information on the interactions of Ca + with macromolecules and with eukafyotic cells. With the increasing industrial use of the lan thanides, their toxicological properties will need to be examined more closely. Rare earth pneumonoconiosis has already been identified as a disease produced by industrial exposure to lanthanides. Several of the biochemical properties of the lanthanides are of relevance to modern medicine. Already cerium-based ointments are used to treat burn wounds, while paramagnetic lanthanides find application in nuclear magnetic res onance imaging. This book is an attempt to collate and to present in reasonable detail existing knowledge of lanthanide biochemistry before the literature be comes unmanageable.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468487480"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468487485"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 444, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=118&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Biochemistry_of_the_Lanthanides-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "A8U2DgAAQBAJ", "etag": "EqlMBr8ilbk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/A8U2DgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Blue Biotechnology", "subtitle": "From Gene to Bioactive Product", "authors": ["Werner E.

Many patients suffering with life-threatening diseases or chronic dysfunctions, which were medically untreatable not long ago, can attest to the wonder these drugs have achieved. Although the ?rst generation of p- tein therapeutics was produced in recombinant Escherichia coli, most recent products use mammalian cells as production hosts. Not long after the ?rst p- duction of recombinant proteins in E. coli, it was realized that the complex tasks of most post-translational modi?cations on proteins could only be ef?ciently carried out in mammalian cells. In the 1990s, we witnessed a rapid expansion of mammalian-cell-derived protein therapeutics, chie?y antibodies. In fact, it has been nearly a decade since the market value of mammalian-cell-derived protein therapeutics surpassed that of those produced from E. coli. A common characteristic of recent antibody products is the relatively large dose required for effective therapy, demanding larger quantities for the treatment of a given disease. This, coupled with the broadening repertoire of protein drugs, has rapidly expanded the quantity needed for clinical applications. The increasing demand for protein therapeutics has not been met exclusively by construction of new manufacturing plants and increasing total volume capacity. More - portantly the productivity of cell culture processes has been driven upward by an order of magnitude in the past decade.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540340072"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540340076"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 168, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biochemistry&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-iRm5BQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cell_Culture_Engineering-sample-pdf.acsm?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
