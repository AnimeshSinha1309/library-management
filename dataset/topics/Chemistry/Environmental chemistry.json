It offers an intense, one-semester examination of selected concepts encountered in this field of study and provides integrated tools in explaining complex chemical problems of environmental importance. Principles typically covered in more comprehensive textbooks are well integrated into general chapter topics and application areas. The goal of this textbook is to provide students with a valuable resource for learning the basic concepts of environmental chemistry from an easy to follow, condensed, application and inquiry-based perspective. Additional statistical, sampling, modeling and data analysis concepts and exercises will be introduced for greater understanding of the underlying processes of complex environmental systems and fundamental chemical principles. Each chapter will have problem-oriented exercises (with examples throughout the body of the chapter) that stress the important concepts covered and research applications/case studies from experts in the field.

A variety of techniques with applications in governmental laboratories, industry, and research are described. The experiments are divided into five parts: biochemical processes in aquatic systems; toxic substances in the environment; food additives and contaminants; chemical ecology; and field surveys. This book is divided into five sections and begins with a discussion on the transformations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and energy in aquatic systems. Various aspects of environmental chemistry including photosynthesis, respiration, biogeochemical cycling, primary production, plant nutrients, water quality, eutrophication, and wastewater treatment are considered. The next section focuses on a wide assortment of environmental contaminants in terms of their behavior and occurrence in various sectors of the environment. In this section, the reader is introduced to gas chromatography, atomic absorption spectroscopy, thin layer chromotography, column chromatography, and techniques for the measurement of atmospheric contaminants. Food and the occurrence of foreign substances that result from deliberate additions or other processes are also analyzed, along with chemical compounds such as allelochemicals, pheromones, and chemical defense substances.

These chapters emphasize both critical assessments of and definitive recommendations for laboratory methodologies and measured thermodynamic properties relating to aluminum chemistry. The next four chapters in The Environmental Chemistry of Aluminum build on this foundation to provide details of the polymeric chemistry of aluminum: its polynuclear and colloidal hydrolytic species in aqueous solution, its complexes with natural organic ligands, including humic substances, and its role as an adsorptive and adsorbent in surface reactions. These chapters are grounded in experimental results rather than conceptual modeling. The final three chapters describe the chemistry of aluminum in soils, waters, and watersheds.

However, it has been the subject of public debate for a short time-since the late 1960s. Curiously, there has been little reaction in the textbook literature to reflect this concern. Apart from some brief and sketchy paperbacks for schools, there has not yet been published a substantial review of environmental chemistry. One reason for this is the breadth of the chemistry involved: it could scarcely be covered by one or two authors, for it is as wide as chemistry itself. The ideal way to write such a book would be to gather a couple of dozen authors in one place and keep them together for 6 months of discussions and writing. This not being very practical, it was decided to do the next best thing and to attempt to network a number of men together in mutual correspondence and interaction, which would lead to a book that had the advantages of the expertise of a large number of persons, and lacked many of the usual disadvan tages of the multi author book. Thus, synopses of the various articles were sent to each author, and they were encouraged to interact with each other in attempting to avoid repetition and in keeping their symbols uniform and their presentation style coordinated.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461569213"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461569214"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 796, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1LXSBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Environmental_Chemistry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1LXSBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "One reason for this is the breadth of the chemistry involved: it could scarcely be covered by one or two authors, for it is as wide as chemistry itself."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "g4olvwEACAAJ", "etag": "EkE5ZJDHxno", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/g4olvwEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Environmental Chemistry", "authors": ["A.K De"], "publishedDate": "2017", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9385923897"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789385923890"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 371, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Environmental chemistry"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g4olvwEACAAJ&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g4olvwEACAAJ&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Environmental_Chemistry.html?hl=&id=g4olvwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=g4olvwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "UesL6ZUgMqUC", "etag": "0I4p1Y5fLUA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/UesL6ZUgMqUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Environmental Chemistry of Dyes and Pigments", "authors": ["Abe Reife", "Abraham Reife", "Harold S.

The pigment anddye industry has had to develop the technology necessary to analyzeand remediate pollutants in wastewater. Although these efforts haveproduced a considerable volume of information, until now, no singlebook has provided an organized, comprehensive treatment of theenvironmental chemistry of synthetic colorants. Environmental Chemistry of Dyes and Pigments is the firstcomprehensive reference to address the environmental problems posedby synthetic colorants, and to provide a forum for the solutionsproposed by industry, government, and academia. Focusing ondevelopments in the field over the past two decades, it deals withall aspects of colored wastewater treatment, the disposal of dyes,analytical methods, toxicity, and regulatory questions. In its coverage of wastewater treatment, this book addresses boththe most commonly used methods and those specifically designed toaddress pollution problems at the source by analyzing for andremoving dyes and pollutants from wastewater effluent. Throughout,real-world data on a wide variety of dyes and dye intermediates isprovided, as well as cost-effective strategies for dealing withwastewater treatment. In addition, several chapters are devoted to the perspectives ofnational and international experts on regulations governing themanufacture, handling, use, and disposal of synthetic dyes andpigments. The impact these regulations have had on both U.S. andforeign industry is also discussed. A complete, comprehensive, and up-to-date guide to pollutionprevention in the dyestuff and textile industries Environmental Chemistry of Dyes and Pigments is the onlyself-contained volume that focuses on the environmental impact ofsynthetic dyes and pigments. Contributions by international expertsfrom industry, academia, and government make this an indispensablebook for anyone dealing with the environmental problems posed bysynthetic colorants. It covers the entire range of environmentalissues, from waste treatment and analysis to pollution preventionand government regulations. Covers the latest wastewater treatment methods Shows how to use recycling and reusing methods effectively, whilecutting production costs Describes state-of-the-art technology, including the PACT(r)system Explains analysis techniques, including spectrometry andionization Covers legislative issues and the regulatory status of variouscompounds in both the United States and abroad Examines the various pollution prevention programs instituted bygovernment and industry Bridging the gap between industrial interests and environmentalconcerns, Environmental Chemistry of Dyes and Pigments stands as aninvaluable resource for scientists, researchers, and engineers inthe textile and dyestuff industries, and in the environmentalsciences.

Throughout the book\u2019s long life, it has chronicled emerging issues such as organochloride pesticides, detergent phosphates, stratospheric ozone depletion, the banning of chlorofluorocarbons, and greenhouse warming. During this time the first Nobel Prize for environmental chemistry was awarded. Written by environmental chemist Stanley Manahan, each edition has reflected the field\u2019s shift of emphasis from pollution and its effects to its current emphasis on sustainability. What makes this book so enduring? Completely revised, this ninth edition retains the organizational structure that has made past editions so popular with students and professors while updating coverage of principles, tools, and techniques to provide fundamental understanding of environmental chemistry and its applications. It includes end-of chapter questions and problems, and a solutions manual is available upon qualifying course adoptions. Rather than immediately discussing specific environmental problems, Manahan systematically develops the concept of environmental chemistry so that when he covers specific pollutions problems the background necessary to understand the problem has already been developed. New in the Ninth Edition: revised discussion of sustainability and environmental science updates information on chemical fate and transport, cycles of matter examination of the connection between environmental chemistry and green chemistry coverage of transgenic crops the role of energy in sustainability potential use of toxic substances in terrorist attacks Manahan emphasizes the importance of the anthrosphere \u2013 that part of the environment made and operated by humans and their technologies. Acknowledging technology will be used to support humankind on the planet, it is important that the anthrosphere be designed and operated in a manner that is compatible with sustainability and that it interacts constructively with the other environmental spheres. With clear explanations, real-world examples, and updated questions and answers, the book emphases the concepts essential to the practice of environmental science, technology, and chemistry while introducing the newest innovations in the field.

This meeting was the tenth annual international symposium sponsored by the Texas A&M Industry-University Cooperative Chemistry Program (IUCCP). The program was developed by an academic-industrial steering committee consisting of the co-chairmen, Professors Donald T. Sawyer and Arthur E. Martell of the Texas A&M University Chemistry Department, and members appointed by the sponsoring companies: Bernie A. Allen, Jr., Dow Chemical USA; Kirk W. Brown, Texas A&M University; Abraham Clearfield, Texas A&M University; Greg Leyes, Monsanto Company; Jay Warner, Hoechst-Celanese Corporation; Paul M. Zakriski, BF Goodrich Company; and Emile A. Schweikert, Texas A&M University (IUCCP Coordinator). The subject of this conference reflects the interest that has developed in academic institutions and industry for technological solutions to environmental contamination by industrial wastes. Progress is most likely with strategies that minimize waste production from industrial processes. Clearly the key to the protection and preservation of the environment will be through R&D that optimizes chemical processes to minimize or eliminate waste streams. Eleven of the papers are directed to waste minimization. An additional ten papers discuss chemical and biological remediation strategies for hazardous wastes that contaminate soils, sludges, and water.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306443031"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306443039"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 312, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WDVKWd0cjnAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WDVKWd0cjnAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WDVKWd0cjnAC&pg=PA89&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WDVKWd0cjnAC&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Industrial_Environmental_Chemistry.html?hl=&id=WDVKWd0cjnAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Industrial_Environmental_Chemistry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WDVKWd0cjnAC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WDVKWd0cjnAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "THE ROLE OF CATALYSIS IN INDUSTRIAL WASTE REDUCTION David Allen <br>\nDepartment of <b>Chemical</b> Engineering University of California, Los Angeles Los <br>\nAngeles, Ca. 90024 INTRODUCTION Millions of tons of hazardous waste are&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "C_foAAAACAAJ", "etag": "+D3pfiYRllo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/C_foAAAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Textbook of Environmental Chemistry", "authors": ["O.

In urban environments, aerosol particles can affect human health through their inhalation. Atmospheric aerosols originate from naturally occurring processes, such as volcanic emissions, sea spray and mineral dust emissions, or from anthropogenic activity such as industry and combustion processes. Aerosols present pathways for reactions, transport, and deposition that would not occur in the gas phase alone. Understanding the ways in which aerosols behave, evolve, and exert these effects requires knowledge of their formation and removal mechanism, transport processes, as well as their physical and chemical characteristics. Motivated by climate change and adverse health effects of traffic-related air pollution, aerosol research has intensified over the past couple of decades, and recent scientific advances offer an improved understanding of the mechanisms and factors controlling the chemistry of atmospheric aerosols. Environmental Chemistry of Aerosols brings together the current state of knowledge of aerosol chemistry, with chapters written by international leaders in the field. It will serve as an authoritative and practical reference for scientists studying the Earth's atmosphere and as an educational and training resource for both postgraduate students and professional atmospheric scientists.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1405139196"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781405139199"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 268, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eVwRAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eVwRAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eVwRAQAAIAAJ&q=Environmental+chemistry&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eVwRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Environmental_Chemistry_of_Aerosols.html?hl=&id=eVwRAQAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eVwRAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Environmental Chemistry of Aerosols brings together the current state of knowledge of aerosol chemistry, with chapters written by international leaders in the field."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "84tkAAAAIAAJ", "etag": "QCQFiO2zE/U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/84tkAAAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Preprints of Papers", "authors": ["American Chemical Society.

This new edition of a bestseller provides an updated text with an increased emphasis on sustainability and green chemistry. It is organized based on the five spheres of Earth\u2019s environment: (1) the hydrosphere (water), (2) the atmosphere (air), (3) the geosphere (solid Earth), (4) the biosphere (life), and (5) the anthrosphere (the part of the environment made and used by humans). The first chapter defines environmental chemistry and each of the five environmental spheres. The second chapter presents the basics of toxicological chemistry and its relationship to environmental chemistry. Subsequent chapters are grouped by sphere, beginning with the hydrosphere and its environmental chemistry, water pollution, sustainability, and water as nature\u2019s most renewable resource. Chapters then describe the atmosphere, its structure and importance for protecting life on Earth, air pollutants, and the sustainability of atmospheric quality. The author explains the nature of the geosphere and discusses soil for growing food as well as geosphere sustainability. He also describes the biosphere and its sustainability. The final sphere described is the anthrosphere. The text explains human influence on the environment, including climate, pollution in and by the anthrosphere, and means of sustaining this sphere. It also discusses renewable, nonpolluting energy and introduces workplace monitoring. For readers needing additional basic chemistry background, the book includes two chapters on general chemistry and organic chemistry.

Until now, however, there has been no book designed to help students capture the essence of the subject in a brief course of study. Daniel Jacob, a leading researcher and teacher in the field, addresses that problem by presenting the first textbook on atmospheric chemistry for a one-semester course. Based on the approach he developed in his class at Harvard, Jacob introduces students in clear and concise chapters to the fundamentals as well as the latest ideas and findings in the field. Jacob's aim is to show students how to use basic principles of physics and chemistry to describe a complex system such as the atmosphere. He also seeks to give students an overview of the current state of research and the work that led to this point. Jacob begins with atmospheric structure, design of simple models, atmospheric transport, and the continuity equation, and continues with geochemical cycles, the greenhouse effect, aerosols, stratospheric ozone, the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, smog, and acid rain. Each chapter concludes with a problem set based on recent scientific literature. This is a novel approach to problem-set writing, and one that successfully introduces students to the prevailing issues. This is a major contribution to a growing area of study and will be welcomed enthusiastically by students and teachers alike.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780691001852"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0691001855"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 266, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=14whM9fEOzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=14whM9fEOzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=14whM9fEOzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=14whM9fEOzsC&dq=Environmental+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Atmospheric_Chemistry.html?hl=&id=14whM9fEOzsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=14whM9fEOzsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is a major contribution to a growing area of study and will be welcomed enthusiastically by students and teachers alike."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_U6nuIivmD8C", "etag": "L7YpnCcJV0Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_U6nuIivmD8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Applications of LC-MS in Environmental Chemistry", "authors": ["Damia Barcelo"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "publishedDate": "1996-03-21", "description": "Looking at the literature available, it is clear that there is a need for a book on LC-MS applications in environmental analysis.

The present book aims to provide a critical evaluation of LC-MS in environmental chemistry and it is structured in different areas. Apart from an introductory section with fundamental aspects, application areas using the most relevant interfacing systems (PB, TSP, ES) for the characterization of environmental compounds are included. In this sense, applications are discussed on the characterization of the most relevant compounds of environmental interest such as pesticides, detergents, dyes, polar metabolites, waste streams, organotin compounds and marine toxins with comparison between different interfacing systems. Finally, new methods and strategies in LC-MS, e.g. the use of capillary electrophoresis, MS together with on-line post-column systems in LC-MS are also shown. By the nature of its content and written as it is by experienced practitioners, the book is intended to serve as a practical reference for analytical chemists who need to use LC-MS in environmental studies.

These degradation processes usually involve a cascade of reactions resulting in the formation of a number of transformation products. While we usually know a great deal about the environmental properties, fate and effects of parent synthetic chemicals, our understanding of the impacts of transformation products is much less developed.

Manahan"], "publisher": "CRC Press", "publishedDate": "2010-08-19", "description": "Carefully crafted to provide a comprehensive overview of the chemistry of water in the environment, Water Chemistry: Green Science and Technology of Nature's Most Renewable Resource examines water issues within the broad framework of sustainability, an issue of increasing importance as the demands of Earth\u2019s human population threaten to overwhelm the planet\u2019s carrying capacity. Renowned environmental author Stanley Manahan provides more than just basic coverage of the chemistry of water. He relates the science and technology of this amazing substance to areas essential to sustainability science, including environmental and green chemistry, industrial ecology, and green (sustainable) science and technology. The inclusion of a separate chapter that comprehensively covers energy, including renewable and emerging sources, sets this book a part. Manahan explains how the hydrosphere relates to the geosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and anthrosphere. His approach views Planet Earth as consisting of these five mutually interacting spheres. He covers biogeochemical cycles and the essential role of water in these basic cycles of materials. He also defines environmental chemistry and green chemistry, emphasizing water\u2019s role in the practice of each. Manahan highlights the role of the anthrosphere, that part of the environment constructed and operated by humans. He underscores its overwhelming influence on the environment and its pervasive effects on the hydrosphere.

Although no concerted agreement has been reached yet about the exact content and limits of this interdisciplinary discipline, there seems to be increasing interest in environmental topics that are based on the chemistry embodied in this subject. Linking green chemistry practice to environmental sustainability, Green Chemistry for Environmental Sustainability illustrates the efforts being made to remediate a scathed environment into a pristine one. Links Green Chemistry Practice to Environmental Sustainability Eminent international experts present research on and the application of green chemistry and engineering in addressing current issues of an environmental and social nature. They cover sustainable development and environmental sustainability with chapters on green chemistry and engineering research, the design and synthesis of environmentally benign chemical processes, green approaches to minimize and/or remediate environmental pollution, the development of biomaterials, biofuel, and bioenergy production, biocatalysis, and policies and ethics in green chemistry. The book also explores economics, environmentally benign technologies for greener processes, computational methods and modeling, and green approaches to minimize air and water. Green chemistry has brought a relatively prompt and positive paradigm shift in the overall use and management of natural resources and raw materials for the development of society with a subtle promise to cause far less pronounced harm to the environment. This text provides insight into the chemical and biochemical technologies that are being studied, optimized, and eventually developed to promote environmental sustainability.
