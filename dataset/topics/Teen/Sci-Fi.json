Is there really such a thing as free will? If you could time travel to visit Jesus, would you (and should you)? For hundreds of years, philosophers, scientists and science fiction writers have pondered these questions and many more. In Holy Sci-Fi!, popular writer Paul Nahin explores the fertile and sometimes uneasy relationship between science fiction and religion. With a scope spanning the history of religion, philosophy and literature, Nahin follows religious themes in science fiction from Feynman to Foucault and from Asimov to Aristotle. An intriguing journey through popular and well-loved books and stories, Holy Sci-Fi! shows how sci-fi has informed humanity's attitudes towards our faiths, our future and ourselves.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781493906185"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1493906186"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 224, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sci-Fi&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2100.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2100.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Hl64BAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2100400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2100400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Holy_Sci_Fi-sample-epub.acsm?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Holy_Sci_Fi-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Hl64BAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In Holy Sci-Fi!, popular writer Paul Nahin explores the fertile and sometimes uneasy relationship between science fiction and religion."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "f48nl_3Up8gC", "etag": "W+S756X3Tnc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/f48nl_3Up8gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Building Sci-fi Moviescapes", "subtitle": "The Science Behind the Fiction", "authors": ["Matt Hanson"], "publisher": "Gulf Professional Publishing", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "Building Sci-fi Moviescapes provides a rare, behind-the-scenes examination of how the digital city and space-scapes in science fiction movies are created through the eyes of directors, producers, production designers, and visualization artists.

With insight from critics, film historians, and academics, 101 SCI-FI MOVIES YOU MUST SEE BEFORE YOU DIE, applies knowledge and passion to a century of close encounters, distant planets, time travel, black holes, strange outfits, futuristic technology, inexplicable forces, fantastic spaceships, fluorescent drinks and subterranean societies.

A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready? It's the year 2044, and the real world has become an ugly place. We're out of oil. We've wrecked the climate. Famine, poverty, and disease are widespread. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his creation. For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles are based in the culture of the late twentieth century. And then Wade stumbles onto the key to the first puzzle. Suddenly, he finds himself pitted against thousands of competitors in a desperate race to claim the ultimate prize, a chase that soon takes on terrifying real-world dimensions - and that will leave both Wade and his world profoundly changed. ____________________________________ If you loved READY PLAYER ONE and can't wait for more, check out ARMADA, Ernest Cline's latest geek masterpiece! \u2018Wildly original and stuffed with irresistible nostalgia, Ready Player One is a spectacularly genre-busting, ambitious, and charming debut\u2019 Independent \u2018Part intergalactic scavenger hunt, part romance, and all heart\u2019 CNN \u2018Ernest Cline\u2019s novel deserves to be a modern classic\u2019 SciFiNow \u2018Gorgeously geeky, superbly entertaining, this really is a spectacularly successful debut\u2019 Daily Mail", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781446493830"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1446493830"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 3178, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "3.35.28.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sci-Fi&hl=&cd=44&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 500.32, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 270.17, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C&rdid=book-8qs1-ypf7e0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 500320000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 270170000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ready_Player_One-sample-epub.acsm?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8qs1-ypf7e0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&#39;Wildly original and stuffed with irresistible nostalgia, Ready Player One is a spectacularly genre-busting, ambitious, and charming debut&#39; Independent &#39;Part intergalactic scavenger hunt, part romance, and all heart&#39; CNN &#39;Ernest Cline&#39;s ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vCl_DwAAQBAJ", "etag": "z4xKwDYP3iA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vCl_DwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Recursion", "subtitle": "From the Bestselling Author of Dark Matter Comes the Most Exciting, Twisty Thriller of the Year", "authors": ["Blake Crouch"], "publisher": "Pan Macmillan", "publishedDate": "2019-06-13", "description": "'Recursion takes mind-twisting premises and embeds them in a deeply emotional story about time and loss and grief and most of all, the glory of the human heart' - Gregg Hurwitz, international bestselling author of Orphan X A breathtaking exploration of memory and what it means to be human, Recursion is the follow-up novel to the smash-hit thriller, Dark Matter, by Blake Crouch.

But as humanity builds its interstellar empire in the alien ruins, the mysteries and threats grow deeper. In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed, and to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay. At the heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father's godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cort\u00e1zar and the Mephistophelian prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue, but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father the emperor doesn't guess. And throughout the wide human empire, the scattered crew of the Rocinante fights a brave rear-guard action against Duarte's authoritarian regime. Memory of the old order falls away, and a future under Laconia's eternal rule - and with it, a battle that humanity can only lose - seems more and more certain.

Through the imagination and creativity of science fiction movies, Maynard introduces readers to the profound capabilities presented by new and emerging technologies, and the complex personal and societal challenges they present. The future of artificial intelligence and other technologies: Each movie in the book provides the starting point for exploring key technologies and trends, from genetic engineering (Jurassic Park) and brain-enhancing drugs (Limitless), to human augmentation (Ghost in the Shell), and artificial intelligence (Ex Machina). These are woven together with emerging ideas on technological convergence and responsible and ethical innovation, to provide a sweeping perspective on where our technologies are taking us, and how we ensure this is where we want to go. The enlightening science and philosophies of movies: With each examination of twelve movies, you will take a progressive journey through the fascinating worlds of biological and genetic manipulation, human enhancement and cyber technologies, and nanotechnology. Maynard shows that the fantastical worlds of the movies might not be as impossible as we think.

Tempe dives daily, scavenging the ruins of a bygone era, searching for anything of value to trade for Notes. It isn't food or clothing that she wants to buy, but her dead sister's life. For a price, the research facility on the island of Palindromena will revive the dearly departed for twenty-four hours before returning them to death. It isn't a heartfelt reunion that Tempe is after; she wants answers. Elysea died keeping a terrible secret, one that has ignited an unquenchable fury in Tempe: Her beloved sister was responsible for the death of their parents. Tempe wants to know why. But once revived, Elysea has other plans. She doesn't want to spend her last day in a cold room accounting for a crime she insists she didn't commit. Elysea wants her freedom and one final glimpse at the life that was stolen from her. She persuades Tempe to break her out of the facility, and they embark on a dangerous journey to discover the truth about their parents' death and mend their broken bond. But they're pursued every step of the way by two Palindromena employees desperate to find them before Elysea's time is up--and before the secret behind the revival process and the true cost of restored life is revealed.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780525513964"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0525513965"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 448, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Young Adult Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sci-Fi&hl=&cd=80&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 799.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 399.9, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-t4acDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 799790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 399900000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Vanishing_Deep-sample-epub.acsm?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t4acDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Bestselling author Astrid Scholte, returns with a thrilling adventure in which the dead can be revived...for a price."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WxLaDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "7VxtZ2K1jx8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WxLaDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Alien Queen", "subtitle": "Scifi Alien Romance", "authors": ["Emma Taylor"], "publisher": "", "publishedDate": "2020-04-01", "description": "** A Standalone Short Story with No Cliffhanger! ** Ten years have passed since Jessica had lost her husband during The Flare--- a blaze of fire that had quickly enveloped the entire earth in an explosion of brightness, designed to aid in the attack of the Xantrax Clan which is an alliance of evil aliens from different planets.

The Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman. Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead nonsense. Tamsyn Muir\u2019s Gideon the Ninth unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap off the page, as skillfully animated as arcane revenants. The result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy. Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won\u2019t set her free without a service. Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will be become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon\u2019s sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die. Of course, some things are better left dead.

A wildly successful innovator to rival Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, Vivian Liao is prone to radical thinking, quick decision-making, and reckless action. On the eve of her greatest achievement, she tries to outrun people who are trying to steal her success. In the chilly darkness of a Boston server farm, Viv sets her ultimate plan into motion. A terrifying instant later, Vivian Liao is catapulted through space and time to a far future where she confronts a destiny stranger and more deadly than she could ever imagine. The end of time is ruled by an ancient, powerful Empress who blesses or blasts entire planets with a single thought. Rebellion is literally impossible to consider--until Vivian Liao arrives. Trapped between the Pride\u2014a ravening horde of sentient machines\u2014and a fanatical sect of warrior monks who call themselves the Mirrorfaith, Viv must rally a strange group of allies to confront the Empress and find a way back to the world and life she left behind.

It takes place inside a spaceship after a crash takes place during a failed mission to Titan, one of the Saturn moons. The journey home forces the crew to face its innermost fears while coexisting with each other in a state of desperation. This mesmerizing novel, recalling Arthur C.

His trilogy of Spiral, A Legend of the Future, and Year 200 is still the best of Cuban science fiction.... With a very refined style and well-established scientific-social background, Agust\u00edn\u2019s work surprises through its humanistic content. His concerns surrounding the meaning of life and the evolution of human beings put him in a privileged place among national writers.\u201d \u2014Cuenta Regresiva \"The best and most popular novelist of this genre that the Island has ever given....

A professor of the history of theater at the Escuela de Instructores de Arte in Villa Clara, he is the author of a canonical trilogy of novels: Espiral (Spiral, 1982), for which he was awarded the David Prize; La leyenda del futuro (The Legend of the Future, 1985) and El a\u00f1o 200 (The Year 200, 1990), all scheduled for publication in English translation by Restless Books. While influenced by Ray Bradbury and a translator of Isaac Asimov into Spanish, he aligned himself with the Soviet line of socialist realism defined by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky as well as by Ivan Antonovich Yefremov, author of The Andromeda Nebula, made into a movie directed by Yevgeni Sherstobitov and admired by de Rojas. In Cuban literature, he is said to have begun writing after reading Miguel Collazo\u2019s El viaje (The Journey). After the fall of the Soviet Union, de Rojas stopped writing science fiction and embraced other themes such as Christianity, about which he wrote a novel called El publican (1997), about the disciples of Jesus Christ, that was awarded the Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz Prize. He spent his last years persuaded\u2014and persuading others\u2014that Fidel Castro did not exist.

Arrogant and bombastic, he comes down the mountain expecting an easy conquest: the wealthy, spectacular city state of Kathmandu, ruled by the all-knowing, all-seeing tyrant AI Karma. To his surprise, he finds that Kathmandu is a cut-price paradise, where citizens want for nothing and even the dregs of society are distinctly unwilling to revolt. Everyone seems happy, except for the old Gurkha soldier Bhan Gurung. Knife saint, recidivist, and mass murderer, he is an exile from Kathmandu, pursuing a forty-year-old vendetta that leads to the very heart of Karma. Pushed and prodded by Gurung, Melek Ahmer finds himself in ever deeper conflicts, until they finally face off against Karma and her forces.

Willow Wilson, The Bird King is an epic journey set during the reign of the last sultan in the Iberian peninsula at the height of the Spanish Inquisition. G. Willow Wilson's debut novel Alif the Unseen established her as a vital American Muslim literary voice. The Bird King tells the story of Fatima, a concubine in the royal court of Granada, the last emirate of Muslim Spain, and her dearest friend Hassan, the palace mapmaker. Hassan has a secret - he can draw maps of places he's never seen and bend the shape of reality. When representatives of the newly formed Spanish monarchy arrive to negotiate the sultan's surrender, Fatima befriends one of the women, not realising that she will see Hassan's gift as sorcery and a threat to Christian Spanish rule. With their freedoms at stake, what will Fatima risk to save Hassan and escape the palace walls? As Fatima and Hassan traverse Spain to find safety, The Bird King asks us to consider what love is and the price of freedom at a time when the West and the Muslim world were not yet separate.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781611859041"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1611859042"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 241, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sci-Fi&hl=&cd=114&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 314.37, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 220.06, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-pK6LDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 314370000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 220060000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Bird_King-sample-epub.acsm?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Bird_King-sample-pdf.acsm?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pK6LDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The Bird King tells the story of Fatima, a concubine in the royal court of Granada, the last emirate of Muslim Spain, and her dearest friend Hassan, the palace mapmaker."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "YZ2QDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "aUX+Hlv9mdQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YZ2QDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Future of Another Timeline", "authors": ["Annalee Newitz"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2019-10-24", "description": "\"Do you remember when we had the vote?\" In a world that's just a step away from our own, time travel is possible.
