Filling this conspicuous gap, Ned Schantz presents a lively exploration of the phenomenon, resituating novelistic culture as central even as he ranges across media and the myriad technologies that attend them. Charting the emergence of female networks via the most prominent modes of communication--gossip, letters, and phones--Schantz brings his study to life with unconventional interpretations of classic British novels and popular Hollywood films spanning multiple genres and time periods. With incisive readings of Clarissa, Emma, and Evelina, Schantz shows how gossip both draws sympathy and is repressed by dominant male culture in a recurrent pattern of avowal and disavowal. The epistolary novel added a rhythm to communication that was generative of fantasy, which in turn informed \"telephonic film,\" a development depicted in analyses of movies such as Sorry, Wrong Number; Vertigo; Terminator; and You've Got Mail. Schantz highlights the way the telephone works as a structuring device, not merely a prop, one that shapes the plot and suggests provocative formal implications. While this study traverses an uncanny realm of lost messages and false suitors, telepathy and artificial intelligence, locked rooms and time-traveling stalkers, these occult concerns only confirm the importance of female communication at its most basic level. Illuminating and accessible--Gossip, Letters, Phones reveals female networks as one of narrative's most supple and persistent elements in literature and cinema.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199714622"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199714629"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 200, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&pg=PA54&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 798.38, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 399.19, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&rdid=book-hYyUE8AX9a0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 798380000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 399190000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Gossip_Letters_Phones-sample-epub.acsm?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Gossip_Letters_Phones-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hYyUE8AX9a0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The movement from letter to <b>phone</b> and novel to film is abrupt and demanding, <br>\nboth culturally (or so I&#39;ve gathered) for those who experienced it and conceptually <br>\nfor those who now try to understand it.

The operating words for the proper understanding of these data are science and public health. Science is a tool for making public health decisions, but the framework in which we are operating is truly that of public health. We are looking for problems that have to do with wireless technology. We are trying to decide how this technology impacts on the public for one purpose and one purpose alone, and that purpose is to solve problems that are identified. I would like to challenge you, the reader, to suspend your parochial orientation as you consider these latest findings.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306469015"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306469014"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 290, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA214&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RnLdBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Wireless_Phones_and_Health_II-sample-epub.acsm?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Wireless_Phones_and_Health_II-sample-pdf.acsm?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RnLdBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "MOBILE. <b>PHONES</b>.

New Media facilitated connectedness serve as a privileged lens through which Cameroonians, home and away, scrutinise and mediate sociality. In this rich ethnography, Bettina Frei describes how the internet and mobile phones are adopted by migrants and their non-migrant counterparts in order to maintain transnational relationships, and how the specific medialities of these communication technologies in turn impact on transnational sociality.

It will only briefly cover - in an early, introductory chapter - Symbian OS fundamentals, such as error handling, object creation and destruction, descriptors and active objects. Thereafter it will describe those new features particular to V7.0 (s) and it will provide conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of the OS to give developers a thorough understanding of Symbian OS.Its central approach will be to describe the interaction between the OS and the application, broadly following the lifecycle of an application. At each stage of the lifecycle - for example, on application startup - it will describe what actions take place in the OS, what the system does for the application and what the system expects the application to do. With plenty of code examples, the book will detail advanced features such as user interfaces, files and views, multimedia services and communications and messaging.In contrast to other available and forthcoming titles, its central approach describes the interaction between the OS and the application, broadly following the lifecycle of an application. At each stage of the lifecycle - for example, on application startup - it will describe what actions take place in the OS, what the system does for the application and what the system expects the application to do.

Already revolutionizing audiovisual communication, it's a trend that will only grow more explosively\u2014and who better than National Geographic to create a how-to book aimed directly at the millions who carry a camera phone everywhere and want to make the most of it? Created by two top professionals, this generously illustrated nuts-and-bolts guide is the first of its kind to treat these units as genuine cameras instead of novelties, and the only one to include a full-color photo-essay demonstrating the full capabilities of the latest camera phones. In five easy-to-read chapters, the book explains how to choose good equipment; take better pictures; and store, print and send the best images. Readers will find practical tips on preventing or repairing water damage, protecting easily-scratched lenses inside pockets and purses, and retrieving accidentally-erased images. They'll also learn to access the events, advice, and opportunities of the burgeoning camera phone community, from film festivals to news organizations, moblogs, and more. Featuring the technical savvy of CNet.com's Aimee Baldridge and the creative skill of National Geographic photographer Robert Clark, a camera phone pioneer, this compact yet comprehensive reference combines up-to-the-minute expertise with superb examples, at an inexpensive price that makes it a perfect gift book\u2014or an ideal impulse buy.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781426200861"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1426200862"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 160, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 964.93, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 482.46, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-xWkDAQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 964930000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 482460000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Camera_Phone_Book-sample-epub.acsm?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xWkDAQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "SIM card in your GSM <b>phone</b>.

The compelling discussion and projections about the future of the telephone should give designers everywhere a more informed practice and process, and provide researchers with new ideas to last years. *Rich Ling (an American working in Norway) is a prominent researcher, interviewed in the new technology article in the November 9 issue of the New York Times Magazine. *A particularly \"good read\", this book will be important to the designers, information designers, social psychologists, and others who will have an impact on the development of the new third generation of mobile telephones. *Carefully and wittily written by a senior research scientist at Telenor, Norway's largest telecommunications company, and developer of the first mobile telephone system that allowed for international roaming.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0080518931"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780080518930"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 244, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=54&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3519.94, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3519.94, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&rdid=book-oSwCQ6y6wq8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3519940000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3519940000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Mobile_Connection-sample-epub.acsm?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Mobile_Connection-sample-pdf.acsm?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oSwCQ6y6wq8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The compelling discussion and projections about the future of the telephone should give designers everywhere a more informed practice and process, and provide researchers with new ideas to last years. *Rich Ling (an American working in ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Ds4yvwEACAAJ", "etag": "sc4At9xkBwc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Ds4yvwEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cell Phones", "subtitle": "Business Students in the Business Literature", "authors": ["Chris Piotrowski"], "publishedDate": "2013", "description": "Research on the topic of cell phones has proliferated over the past decade. Based on a review of the literature, it appears that the majority of the extant research on the topic resides in the technology, education, and social sciences fields. Recent reviews indicate that the scope of the research on cell/mobile phones is eclectic in nature (Piotrowski & Kass, 2013). In the field of Education, the focus of research on this topic has a focus on high school students or adolescents. Although there is emergent research on cell phones related to college-age business students, a review of this body of knowledge has not been reported. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to conduct a bibliometric content analysis of research on cell phones related to business students indexed in the business-management literature. The database ABI/Inform was the database selected as this scholarly file has been identified as a major bibliographic source in business education. A keyword search located 114 references; of these, 107 were research articles which then served as the bibliographic pool for further analyses. Results, based on a content analysis typology, showed the following major topical areas of focus: Academic integrity (online cheating), business education, phone upgrades, mode of data collection in research, advertising, and online instruction. Noteworthy areas that are de-emphasized by researchers include: cybercrime, online piracy, company database breaches, and identity theft. Conclusions: with regard to cell/mobile phones, there seems to be a discrepancy between topics stressed in the media versus areas of research interest by academic investigators.

Moreover, the benefits of smart phones on the economy are demystified in this essay. Furthermore, how to earn substantial money online so that you afford to buy your own smart phone is expounded upon in this essay. The future of the smart phone industry will not only be characterized by dynamism as it continues to metaphorically evolve, but will also be eminently auspicious for smart phone manufacturers. Technological advancements will pave the way for a robust and lucrative future for the smart phone industry in the coming years as smart phones become 5G compatible and offer more processing power than ever before. In the coming years, more innovative technologies will be ushered into the smart phone industry which will render smart phones are the more versatile. Smart phone manufacturers are apt to offer more innovative technologies for their smart phones in the coming decades, such as holographic displays, the ability to fold in half, and the ability to experience virtual reality through the smart phone. Technological innovations to smart phones will play a salient role in helping smart phone manufacturers entice more smart phone sales. Smart phone adoption will reach an unprecedented height in the coming years as more and more customers procure smart phones. Customers will become more inclined to procure smart phones as they \"become the preferred device for countless consumer activities. By the end of 2023, penetration of smart phones among adults in developed countries will surpass 90%. Moreover, . smart phone sales will reach 1,850,000,000 per year in 2023, a 19% increase over 2018 and equivalent to over five million units sold per day. Moreover, smart phone ownership among 55-to-75-year-olds is slated to reach 85% in developed countries in 2023, a 10% increase over 2018\" (\"The future of,\" n.d.). Changing customer preferences will drive more customers towards buying smart phones so that they can become more digitally connected to their friends and the economy in ways that mobile phones simply cannot offer them. It stands to preponderantly reason that customer demand for smart phones will continue to amplify across the globe to an unprecedented height as smart phones become a more integral asset in peoples' lives. \"In the next five years we will see more innovative technology being built into our smart phones, such as facial recognition, artificial intelligence, and enhanced connectivity, software, and memory. This will only add to the smart phone's strategic importance to the consumer business industry as it becomes the primary way to communicate, interact and transact with consumers\" (\"The future of,\" n.d.). In the coming years, as companies invest in optimizing their mobile commerce solutions, smart phones will become all the more essential for customers to possess in order to be able to engage in commerce and transact with brands. Companies will invest in optimizing their mobile commerce solutions beyond the ambit of developing more \"mobile-friendly websites\" (\"The future of,\" n.d.) and streamlining their smart phone applications. In the coming years, more companies will attempt to \"integrate the mobile experience into every element of the customer journey. For example, allowing consumers to book, pay for and access tickets on their mobile has become commonplace across the travel and hospitality sector. In the future, we will see more and more elements of a consumer's life optimized for smart phones\" (\"The future of,\" n.d.). In a smart phone connected world, brands that offer the utmost robust and seamless mobile experience to their customers are eminently apt to grow their profitability, brand recognition, brand equity, and brand loyalty to an unprecedented degree.

This book offers an in-depth analysis of communication and the role of mobile phones in Sokod\u00e9, a medium-sized town in Togo, linked to an ICT-based citizen monitoring and evaluation platform. It aims to understand new communication possibilities embedded in existing norms, while taking into account their materiality, approaching mobile phone use as a local micro-politics of communication. Although there is broad consensus that the appropriation of mobile phones has fundamentally changed communication, still few empirical studies show how this takes place. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this book draws a vivid picture of how women and men in Sokod\u00e9 assess the possibilities and limitations of mobile phones. By unfolding the ambivalence of mobile phones that simultaneously enable intimacy, public networks and the positioning of civic actors, this book shows that mobile phones do not simply increase civic engagement.

And the last thing you see before you sleep? Do you find the hours slip away as you idly scroll through your social media timeline? In short, are you addicted to your phone? If so, How to Break Up with Your Phone is here to help. How to Break Up With Your Phone is a smart, practical and useful plan to help you conquer your mobile phone addiction in just 30 days - and take back your life in the process. Recent studies have shown that spending extended time on our phones affects our ability to form new memories, think deeply, focus and absorb information, and the hormones triggered every time we hear our phones buzz both add to our stress levels and are the hallmark signs of addiction. In How to Break Up with Your Phone, award-winning science journalist Catherine Price explores the effects that our constant connectivity is having on our brains, bodies, relationships, and society at large and asks, how much time do you really want to spend on your phone? Over the course of 30 days, Catherine will guide you through an easy-to-follow plan that enables you to identify your goals, priorities and bad habits, tidy your apps, prune your email, and take time away. Lastly, you will create a new, healthier relationship with your phone and establish habits and routines to ensure this new relationship sticks. You don't have to give up your phone forever; instead you will be more mindful not only of how you use your phone, but also about how you choose to spend the precious moments of your life.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781409176275"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1409176274"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Self-Help"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.10.10.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=76&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 324.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 227.15, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0igkDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 324500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 227150000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_to_Break_Up_With_Your_Phone-sample-epub.acsm?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0igkDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "If so, How to Break Up with Your Phone is here to help.

Non-response, particularly in later rounds of the survey, was a substantial problem, largely due to erratic functioning of the mobile network. However, selection due to non-response does not appear to have markedly affected survey results. Response rates were much higher for respondents who owned their own phones. Both compensation provided to respondents in the form of airtime and the type of phone (solar-charged or traditional) were varied experimentally. The type of phone was uncorrelated with response rates and, contrary to expectation, attrition was slightly higher for those receiving the higher level of compensation. The South Sudan Experimental Phone Survey experience suggests that mobile phones can be a viable means of data collection for some purposes, that calling people on their own phones is preferred to handing out phones, and that careful attention should be given to the potential for selective non-response.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "OCLC:828059542"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 33, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Electronic commerce"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hNSJAQAACAAJ&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hNSJAQAACAAJ&dq=Phones&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Challenges_and_Opportunities_of_Mobile_P.html?hl=&id=hNSJAQAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hNSJAQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The proliferation of mobile phones in developing countries has generated a wave of interest in collecting high-frequency socioeconomic surveys using this technology."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "NsLdbwAACAAJ", "etag": "76YAJaFf5K8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NsLdbwAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Mobile Phone Operating Systems", "subtitle": "Symbian Os, Android, Mobile Operating System, Webos, S60, Cyanogenmod, Symbian Platform, Blackberry Os", "authors": ["Books Llc"], "publisher": "Books LLC, Wiki Series", "publishedDate": "2010-09", "description": "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: Android is a mobile operating system for mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers developed by the Open Handset Alliance led by Google. Google purchased the initial developer of the software, Android Inc., in 2005. The unveiling of the Android distribution on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 80 hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. Google released most of the Android code under the Apache License, a free software license. The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is tasked with the maintenance and further development of Android. Android consists of a kernel based on the Linux kernel, with middleware, libraries and APIs written in C and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries based on Apache Harmony. Android uses the Dalvik virtual machine with just-in-time compilation to run compiled Java code. Android has a large community of developers writing applications (\"apps\") that extend the functionality of the devices. Developers write primarily in Java. There are currently more than 250,000 apps available for Android. Android Market is the online app store run by Google, though apps can also be downloaded from third-party sites. Android was listed as the best-selling smartphone platform worldwide in Q4 2010 by Canalys. Android, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, United States in October, 2003 by Andy Rubin (co-founder of Danger), Rich Miner (co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.), N...", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1157464408"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781157464402"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 112, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NsLdbwAACAAJ&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NsLdbwAACAAJ&dq=Phones&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Mobile_Phone_Operating_Systems.html?hl=&id=NsLdbwAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NsLdbwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "UtsaAAAACAAJ", "etag": "nga+nHLgSQw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/UtsaAAAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Hacking Mobile Phones", "authors": ["Ankit Fadia"], "publisher": "Course Technology Ptr", "publishedDate": "2006", "description": "Is your mobile phone safe from hackers?What would you do if somebody broke into your mobile phone and stole all your sensitive e-mail?

The latest research ties this kind of radiation to lowered sperm counts, an increased risk of Alzheimer's, and even cancer.

In contemporary society, mobile phone use is acutely integrated into core social and psychological aspects of everyday life, such as verbal and nonverbal interpersonal communication. Though mobile phones offer users many affordances for social connection that can facilitate interpersonal communication and affiliation formation, previous research on phubbing [phone-snubbing] suggests that mobile phone use during face to face (FtF) interactions can breach interpersonal expectations, be perceived as ostracizing, hinder judgements of intimacy and communication quality, lead to unfavorable interpersonal evaluations, cause conflict within relationships, and impede affiliation formation. I aimed to advance expectancy violation theory (EVT) by using the axioms of the theory to make predictions involving nonverbal behaviors (e.g., phubbing expectancy violations and mobile phone mimicry), interpersonal judgements, and self-disclosure. Much like self-disclosure, humans evolved to automatically engage in nonverbal mimicry, or synchronous behavioral matching (i.e., automatically or unintentionally touching one's face after their interaction partner engaged in the same behavior), as a means of building affiliation and promoting positive interpersonal judgements. Following this premise, I examined whether mobile phone checking mimicry, or behavioral matching between FtF interaction partners involving how they use their mobile phones, may promote positive interpersonal judgements (e.g., increased perceived liking, trust, and empathy) that subsequently may be associated with higher levels of self-disclosure. Phubbing effects research currently maintains that mobile phone use, during FtF interactions, tends to lead to adverse interpersonal outcomes among mobile phone users of all ages. However, I used a 2x1 between subject laboratory experiment with college students (N = 77) to assess whether phubbing, expectancy violations, and mobile phone checking mimicry influenced interpersonal judgements and self-disclosure within the context of a face-to-face get-to-know-you activity. The results suggest that mobile phone checking, perceptions of negative phubbing expectancy violations, and mobile phone checking mimicry, may have limited effects on self-disclosure and interpersonal judgements in a get-to-know-you activity. Specifically, phubbing was inversely associated with self-disclosure; however, mobile phone checking mimicry was positively associated with self-disclosure.

Yuta is the Yolngu word for new. Phone & Spear: A Yuta Anthropology is a project inspired by the gloriously cheeky and deeply meaningful audiovisual media made with and circulated by mobile phones by an extended Aboriginal family in northern Australia. Building on a ten-year collaboration by the community-based arts collective Miyarrka Media, the project is an experiment in the anthropology of co-creation. It is a multivoiced portrait of an Indigenous society using mobile phones inventively to affirm connections to kin and country amid the difficult and often devastating circumstances of contemporary remote Aboriginal life. But this is not simply a book about Aboriginal art, mobile phones, and social renewal. If old anthropology understood its task as revealing one world to another, yuta anthropology is concerned with bringing different worlds into relationship. Following Yolngu social aesthetics--or what Miyarrka Media translate as \"the law of feeling\"--the book is a relational technology in its own right: an object that combines color, pattern, and story to bring once distant worlds into new sensuously mediated connections.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1912685183"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781912685189"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["SOCIAL SCIENCE"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KAxYwwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KAxYwwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KAxYwwEACAAJ&dq=Phones&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KAxYwwEACAAJ&dq=Phones&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Phone_Spear.html?hl=&id=KAxYwwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KAxYwwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "But this is not simply a book about Aboriginal art, mobile phones, and social renewal."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "gzpCDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "hiwUE1Er9ro", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gzpCDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Android Phones & Tablets For Dummies", "authors": ["Dan Gookin"], "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons", "publishedDate": "2017-12-07", "description": "Outsmart your new Android Getting a smartphone or tablet can be intimidating for anyone, but this user-friendly guide is here to help you to get the most out of all your new gadget has to offer!

Recent PEW Internet research shows that more than half of U.S. cell phone owners have smartphones.

This paper examines who accesses the Internet mostly using a cell phone among the Internet users who access the Internet at least occasionally and what makes them regard their cell phone as a major Internet access medium. The results of this paper show that users who use their cell phones as their major Internet access medium are more likely to have a smartphones on which apps can be installed and used, not to have other portable PCs, to be young, to have less education, and to be nonwhite.

Then In The Early 1990S The Elephant Seemed To Wake Up From Its Slumber And Slowly Begin To Change Until Today, In The First Decade Of The Twenty-First Century, Some Have Begun To See It Morphing Into A Tiger. As India Turns Sixty, Shashi Tharoor, Novelist And Essayist, Reminds Us Of The Paradox That Is India, The Elephant That Is Becoming A Tiger: With The Highest Number Of Billionaires In Asia, It Still Has The Largest Number Of People Living Amid Poverty And Neglect, And More Children Who Have Not Seen The Inside Of A Schoolroom Than Any Other Country. So What Does The Twenty-First Century Hold For India? Will It Bring The Strength Of The Tiger And The Size Of An Elephant To Bear Upon The World? Or Will It Remain An Elephant At Heart? In More Than Sixty Essays Organized Thematically Into Six Parts, Shashi Tharoor Analyses The Forces That Have Made Twenty-First Century India And Could Yet Unmake It. He Discusses The Country S Transformation In His Characteristic Lucid Prose, Writing With Passion And Engagement On A Broad Range Of Subjects, From The Very Notion Of Indianness In A Pluralist Society To The Evolution Of The Once Sleeping Giant Into A World Leader In The Realms Of Science And Technology; From The Men And Women Who Make Up His India Gandhi And Nehru And The Less Obvious Ramanujan And Krishna Menon To An Eclectic Array Of Indian Experiences And Realities, Virtual And Spiritual, Political And Filmi. The Book Is Leavened With Whimsical And Witty Pieces On Cricket, Bollywood And The National Penchant For Holidays, And Topped Off With An A To Z Glossary On Indianness, Written With Tongue Firmly In Cheek.

Starting with Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s revolutionary \u201charmonic telegraph,\u201d by the middle of the twentieth century the phone system had grown into something extraordinary, a web of cutting-edge switching machines and human operators that linked together millions of people like never before. But the network had a billion-dollar flaw, and once people discovered it, things would never be the same. Exploding the Phone tells this story in full for the first time. It traces the birth of long-distance communication and the telephone, the rise of AT&T\u2019s monopoly, the creation of the sophisticated machines that made it all work, and the discovery of Ma Bell\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. Phil Lapsley expertly weaves together the clandestine underground of \u201cphone phreaks\u201d who turned the network into their electronic playground, the mobsters who exploited its flaws to avoid the feds, the explosion of telephone hacking in the counterculture, and the war between the phreaks, the phone company, and the FBI.
