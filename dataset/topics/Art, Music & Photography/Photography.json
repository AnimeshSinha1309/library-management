It was 13 years before Tennessee became the 16th state. The town began as a small frontier settlement along the banks of the French Broad River in the short-lived state of Franklin. In 1793, Dandridge became the county seat for the newly formed Jefferson County. The county was named for then U.S. secretary of state Thomas Jefferson. Dandridge is the only town in the United States named for first lady Martha Dandridge Custis Washington. Davy Crockett married his first wife near Dandridge, and the courthouse still has his marriage bond in its archives. Over the years, it has played host to presidents Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew Johnson. During the Civil War, the Battle of Dandridge was fought there in winter 1864. In 1942, the town was saved when the Tennessee Valley Authority built a dike to protect it from the waters of Douglas Lake.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439626689"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439626685"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 128, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1145.67, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 572.84, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&rdid=book-XV1SzK4hgmcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1145670000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 572840000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dandridge-sample-epub.acsm?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dandridge-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XV1SzK4hgmcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "hmvm7nw8gd0C", "etag": "25Sv1G9iAAE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hmvm7nw8gd0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Photoshop CS3: Essential Skills", "authors": ["Mark Galer", "Philip Andrews"], "publisher": "Taylor & Francis", "publishedDate": "2007-05-30", "description": "Brimming with beautiful pictures, this successful book guides you through a project-based, progressive curriculum so that you can build all the essential skills to enhance photographs creatively and professionally with Photoshop CS3.

The Bureau of Surrealist Research, the major Surrealist exhibitions, and the photographs of Paris by Brassai, Andre Kertesz, Ilse Bing, Germaine Krull, and Man Ray, among others, all reflect the tumultuous social and cultural transformations occurring in Paris in the 1920s and 30s. Juxtaposing the strange with the familiar, they seek to break down repressive hierarchies. At the same time, they represent a desire to change the world through experimental activities. Introduced by Therese Lichtenstein, with essays by Therese Lichtenstein, Julia Kelly, Colin Jones, and Whitney Chadwick, this absorbing volume considers the social, aesthetic, and political stances of the Surrealists as they probed hidden aspects of the commonplace and blurred the boundaries between dreams and reality, subjectivity and objectivity.

This book breaks new ground by doing something for digital photographers that\u2019s never been done before\u2013it cuts through the bull and shows you exactly \u201chow to do it.\u201d It\u2019s not a bunch of theory; it doesn\u2019t challenge you to come up with your own settings or figure things out on your own. Instead, it does something that virtually no other Elements bookhas ever done\u2013it tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why. If you\u2019re looking for one of those \u201ctell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filter\u201d books, this isn\u2019t it. You can grab any other Elements book on the shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you the inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting, editing, sharpening, retouching, and printing your photos like a pro. You\u2019ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective these techniques are\u2013once you know the secrets. LEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT Each year we train thousands of digital photographers and, almost without exception, they have the same questions and face the same problems\u2013that\u2019s exactly what we cover in this book. You\u2019ll learn: \u2022 The real secrets of how the pros retouch portraits \u2022 How to unlock the power of layers (you\u2019ll be amazed at how easy it is!) \u2022 How to use Camera Raw for processing not only RAW photos, but JPEGs, \u2022 TIFFs, and PSDs, too! (And you\u2019ll learn why so many pros like it best\u2013because it\u2019s faster and easier) \u2022 The sharpening techniques the pros really use (there\u2019s an entire chapter just on this!) \u2022 How to deal with common digital camera image problems, including brightening people in dark shadows and getting the best color possible \u2022 The most requested photographic special effects, and much more! THE BOOK\u2019S SECRET WEAPON Although Elements 13 offers some digital photography features that Photoshop CC doesn\u2019t offer, there are plenty of features that Photoshop CC has that Elements 13 still doesn\u2019t have (things like channels, HDR, etc.). But in this book, you\u2019ll learn some slick workarounds, cheats, and some fairly ingenious ways to replicate many of those Photoshop features from right within Elements. Plus, you can follow along with all the images used in the book, available for download on the book\u2019s companion webpage. Since this book is designed for photographers, it doesn\u2019t waste your time talking about what a pixel is, how to frame a shot, set your exposure, etc., and there\u2019s no talk about which camera or printer to buy. It\u2019s all Elements, step by step, cover to cover, in the only book of its kind, and you\u2019re gonna love it!", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780133990225"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0133990222"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uufsBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uufsBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uufsBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uufsBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uufsBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1693.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1693.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uufsBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-uufsBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1693790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1693790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uufsBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vKNdAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "bjnNQlOw4fw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vKNdAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Photoshop for Lightroom Users", "authors": ["Scott Kelby"], "publisher": "Peachpit Press", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17", "description": "Anyone who uses Adobe Photoshop Lightroom for image management, editing, and workflow knows it is great software, and it has only gotten better with each new version.

Scott Kelby, the #1 bestselling author of photography books, wrote Photoshop for Lightroom Users exactly for those Lightroom users who have recognized that they need Photoshop for the other 20% of their workflow, which will take their images to the next level. There is already a substantial audience for this book, and of course Adobe\u2019s brand-new offering of a Lightroom and Photoshop Creative Cloud bundle for $9.99/month will certainly help grow this Lightroom-and-Photoshop audience very quickly in the coming months. These users don\u2019t need to know everything about Photoshop. They just need to know the essentials edits, techniques, retouching tutorials, and tweaks that they can\u2019t perform in Lightroom, but which will take their images up a notch. Scott covers everything from compositing to adding text over an image to retouching to creating a book cover to advanced sharpening techniques.

Whether it's a bad performance from an actor, a hole in the story or script, continuity or pacing issues, or something being placed in a shot that shouldn't be, there's no shortage of problems encountered once postproduction has begun. Fixing these problems then becomes the job of the editor. This book provides those editors with creative editing solutions they can employ to overcome these problems and is the key to nursing a sick project back to health in the editing room. Though the book takes an application-agnostic approach, specific solutions are presented for today's most commonly used non-linear editing applications. Solutions more relevant to certain genres are discussed in-depth, as are solutions that editors can employ through the use of simple VFX techniques. Case studies and interviews with Hollywood editors provide readers with real-world problems encountered, and solutions used to overcome them.

Instead she argues passionately that looking at such images\u2014and learning to see the people in them\u2014is an ethically and politically necessary act that connects us to our modern history of violence and probes the human capacity for cruelty. Grappling with critics from Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht to Susan Sontag and the postmoderns\u2014and analyzing photographs from such events as the Holocaust, China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, and recent terrorist acts\u2014Linfield explores the complex connection between photojournalism and the rise of human rights ideals. In the book\u2019s concluding section, she examines the indispensable work of Robert Capa, James Nachtwey, and Gilles Peress and asks how photography should respond to the increasingly nihilistic trajectory of modern warfare. A bracing and unsettling book, The Cruel Radiance convincingly demonstrates that if we hope to alleviate political violence, we must first truly understand it\u2014and to do that, we must begin to look.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0226482529"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226482521"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 344, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.8.9.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4J81JfTofE0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4J81JfTofE0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4J81JfTofE0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4J81JfTofE0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4J81JfTofE0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1761.53, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1761.53, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4J81JfTofE0C&rdid=book-4J81JfTofE0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1761530000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1761530000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Cruel_Radiance-sample-epub.acsm?id=4J81JfTofE0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Cruel_Radiance-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4J81JfTofE0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4J81JfTofE0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vSpGjhWGYssC", "etag": "5AxGMkajkEU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vSpGjhWGYssC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Rose That Grew From Concrete", "authors": ["Tupac Shakur"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "1999-11-01", "description": "A collection of verse by the late hip-hop star Tupac Shakur includes more than one hundred poems confronting such wide-ranging topics as poverty, motherhood, Van Gogh, and Mandela", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780671028442"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0671028448"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 149, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 19, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vSpGjhWGYssC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vSpGjhWGYssC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vSpGjhWGYssC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vSpGjhWGYssC&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rose_That_Grew_From_Concrete.html?hl=&id=vSpGjhWGYssC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vSpGjhWGYssC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2vtuJpdx5_gC", "etag": "aRq+CqbV+3s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2vtuJpdx5_gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Reconfigured Eye", "subtitle": "Visual Truth in the Post-photographic Era", "authors": ["William J.

It tells the true stories of the 46 pioneers who did most to master the art of celestial photography, as it was known during its early days; and whose efforts have made it possible for us to see the many magnificent pictures of the Universe featured in books, magazines and on the internet. In its TWO magnificent volumes is contained an unbelievable collection of tales of adventure, adversity and ultimate triumph and tells the uplifting stories of this small band of ordinary men and women, who did such extraordinary things; overcoming obstacles as diverse as war, poverty, cholera, death, very unfriendly cannibal natives and even exploding donkeys. It has been written with a no specific audience in mind - it is a book for anybody in fact - astronomers, photographers, historians, genealogists, art dealers, students, artists, doctors, farmers, builders, teachers & many more.

The Jews who have settled in New Orleans from 1757 to the present have had a very different experience than others in the South. New Orleans was a wide-open frontier that attracted gamblers, sailors, con artists, planters, and merchants. Most early Jewish immigrants were bachelors who took Catholic wives, if they married at all.

Humans of New York: Stories presents a whole new group of humans, complete with stories that delve deeper and surprise with greater candour. Back in the summer of 2010, photographer Brandon Stanton began an ambitious project \u2013 to single-handedly create a photographic census of New York City. The photos he took and the accompanying interviews became the blog Humans of New York. In the first three years, his audience steadily grew from a few hundred to over one million. In 2013, his book Humans of New York, based on that blog, was published and immediately catapulted to the top of the NY Times Bestseller List where it stayed for many weeks. The appeal of the Humans of New York blog has been so great that in the course of the next year Brandon's following increased tenfold to over 12 million followers on Facebook and is still growing.

The book reconsiders the position of craft, which is often understood as inferior to \u2018art\u2019, with a particular focus on questions of labour in animation production and gendered practices. The notion of craft has been widely investigated in a number of areas including art, design and textiles, but despite the fact that a wide range of animators use craft-based techniques, the value of craft has not been interrogated in this context until now. Seeking to address such a gap in the literature, this collection considers the concept of craft through a range of varying case studies. Chapters include studies on experimental animation, computer animation, trauma and memory, children\u2019s animation and silhouette animation among others. The Crafty Animator also goes some way to exploring the relationship craft has with the digital in the context of animation production. Through these varied discussions, this book problematizes simplistic notions about the value of certain methods and techniques, working to create a dialogue between craft and animation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030139438"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030139433"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 231, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-JCGQDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Crafty_Animator-sample-epub.acsm?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Crafty_Animator-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JCGQDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZMZbaU_LbY4C", "etag": "MuDgZPs5d2U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZMZbaU_LbY4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Light Science and Magic", "subtitle": "An Introduction to Photographic Lighting", "authors": ["Fil Hunter", "Steven Biver", "Paul Fuqua"], "publisher": "Taylor & Francis", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02", "description": "This book is renowned for being the book to own to understand lighting!

Out of the many gymnasiums in Over-the-Rhine and the West End came world champions such as Freddie Miller, Ezzard Charles, Bud Smith, and Aaron Pryor. This book is the story of a fascinating aspect of Cincinnati's great sports heritage--the boxing game--with all its leather-punching drama. From the frontierlike matches of the 19th-century river town to the urban ethnic and social influences of the 20th and 21st centuries, Cincinnati Boxing brings a rich part of local history to life.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439616994"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "143961699X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 128, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1145.67, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 572.84, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&rdid=book-ijtXGDeUAsIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1145670000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 572840000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cincinnati_Boxing-sample-epub.acsm?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cincinnati_Boxing-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ijtXGDeUAsIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EHDD4G45Qh0C", "etag": "GEo9rZIBfHc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EHDD4G45Qh0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Croton Dams and Aqueduct", "authors": ["Christopher R.

From the beginnings of the first Croton Dam, completed in 1842, and of the new dam, which was finished in 1907, up to the present day, The Croton Dams and Aqueduct provides a stunning portrait of the entire project and the region that it impacted: New York City and Westchester County. As early as the 1770s, New York considered creating waterworks and even proposed damming area rivers, including the Hudson. With disease and fires blamed on the lack of water, plans were created c. 1830 to dam the Croton River. By 1842, water from the first dam flowed into New York City from Yorktown. Built to provide enough water for \"centuries,\" the first dam was obsolete by the 1880s. Exponential growth from immigration created the demand for more water, and New York built the New Croton Dam. The new dam not only provided clean water for New York's burgeoning population but also spawned a new community of immigrant workers in the once Anglo community of Westchester County.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0738504556"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780738504551"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 128, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EHDD4G45Qh0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EHDD4G45Qh0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EHDD4G45Qh0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EHDD4G45Qh0C&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Croton_Dams_and_Aqueduct.html?hl=&id=EHDD4G45Qh0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Croton_Dams_and_Aqueduct-sample-pdf.acsm?id=EHDD4G45Qh0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EHDD4G45Qh0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "JOxn_doCeYQC", "etag": "0b5gIqFmVv0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JOxn_doCeYQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Documenting America, 1935-1943", "authors": ["Lawrence W.

photography. However, there is much, much more to working with textures than simply merging them with an image via Photoshop. In this gorgeous new guide from texture guru Sarah Gardner, you'll learn everything there is to know about how to maximize the potential of these exciting tools. In addition to hundreds of beautiful example images, this book is also packed with practical advice on what makes a good texture, and how and when to use them. How an image is initially captured and processed has a significant impact on the effect a texture will have, so you'll also learn what to consider when composing and shooting (rather than simply relying on post-processing) and how to use lighting and background considerations effectively for later work with textures. Workshop notes and a supplemental website will help you put Sarah's techniques into practice immediately. Beautiful enough to sit on your coffee table yet practical enough to store near your computer, this book will show you everything you need to know to get that coveted vintage-feel in your images, whether you're a casual family snapper or a seasoned professional.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781136108693"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1136108696"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "4.7.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tyIX36OucBUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tyIX36OucBUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tyIX36OucBUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tyIX36OucBUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tyIX36OucBUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3810.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3810.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tyIX36OucBUC&rdid=book-tyIX36OucBUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3810220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3810220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Art_Beyond_the_Lens-sample-epub.acsm?id=tyIX36OucBUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Art_Beyond_the_Lens-sample-pdf.acsm?id=tyIX36OucBUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tyIX36OucBUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "p_8GIy8jy4AC", "etag": "1WeKG33y4X0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/p_8GIy8jy4AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Chromatic Cinema", "subtitle": "A History of Screen Color", "authors": ["Richard Misek"], "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons", "publishedDate": "2010-02-02", "description": "Chromatic Cinema provides the first wide-ranging historicaloverview of screen color, exploring the changing uses and meaningsof color in moving images, from hand painting in early skirt dancefilms to current trends in digital color manipulation.

Standardized at 6 1/2-by-4 1/4-inches, they were just large enough to reveal extensive detail, leading to the incorporation of elaborate poses, backdrops, and props. Inexpensive and sold by the dozen, they transformed getting one's portrait made from a formal event taken up once or twice in a lifetime into a commonplace practice shared with friends. The cards reinforced middle class Americans' sense of family. They allowed people to show off their material achievements and comforts, and the best cards projected an informal immediacy that encouraged viewers feel emotionally connected with those portrayed. The phenomenon even led sitters to act out before the camera. By making photographs an easygoing fact of life, the cards set the root for the snapshot and even today's photo sharing. This first-ever in-depth examination of the cabinet card phenomena, assembled by Dr. John Rohrbach, senior curator of photographs at the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, takes the form of a major travelling exhibition and book. The project finds its roots in the work of New York City photography Napoleon Sarony who, starting in the 1860s, made cabinet cards his central tool for marketing the stars of the day. The project reveals how in reaction to the cards' ubiquity, photographers across the United States worked assiduously to set their businesses apart through use of elaborate, often incongruous, backdrops, overlays, and promotional advertising printed on both sides of the cards. It highlights how the cards transformed photography from a formal event into an avenue for personal expression where sitters took full advantage of photography's realism while openly playing with the medium's believability. In short, cabinet cards made photography modern. Essays by Rohrbach, Salvesen, and Pauwels address how cabinet cards reflected and encouraged the wide embrace of photography (Rohrbach), an in-depth essay on California photographer R. J. Arnold, who built a successful small-town business on the cabinet card (Salvesen), and an essay on New York City photographer Napoleon Sarony's innovative efforts using his patented Posing Apparatus\"--", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780520306684"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0520306686"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 232, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Cabinet photographs"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4pDqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4pDqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4pDqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4pDqDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Acting_Out.html?hl=&id=4pDqDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4pDqDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "IKjg1c7s5pcC", "etag": "X2c9/L90kO8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IKjg1c7s5pcC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Sorted Books", "authors": ["Nina Katchadourian", "Brian Dillon"], "publisher": "Chronicle Books", "publishedDate": "2013-03-05", "description": "Assembled and photographed in various private homes, libraries, and museums, the conceptual artist presents her stacks or \"clusters\" of books exhibiting creative and playful expressions formed with their titles.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781452113296"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1452113297"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 174, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Design"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IKjg1c7s5pcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IKjg1c7s5pcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IKjg1c7s5pcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IKjg1c7s5pcC&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sorted_Books.html?hl=&id=IKjg1c7s5pcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IKjg1c7s5pcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CTTtBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "mbi76fLZImY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CTTtBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Photoshop Workbook", "subtitle": "Professional Retouching and Compositing Tips, Tricks, and Techniques", "authors": ["Glyn Dewis"], "publisher": "Peachpit Press", "publishedDate": "2014-12-22", "description": "The Photoshop Workbook: Professional Retouching and Compositing Tips, Tricks, and Techniques reveals the creative skills that photographer and retoucher Glyn Dewis uses for his global clients.

As early as the 1670s, experimental philosophers at the Royal Society of London had studied the visual effects of dynamic combustibles. By the 1770s, chemical volatility became central to the ambitious paintings of Sir Joshua Reynolds, premier portraitist and first president of Britain\u2019s Royal Academy of Arts. Valued by some critics for changing in time (and thus, for prompting intellectual reflection on the nature of time), Reynolds\u2019s unstable chemistry also prompted new techniques of chemical replication among Matthew Boulton, James Watt, and other leading industrialists. In turn, those replicas of chemically decaying academic paintings were rediscovered in the mid-nineteenth century and claimed as origin points in the history of photography. Tracing the long arc of chemically produced and reproduced art from the 1670s through the 1860s, the book reconsiders early photography by situating it in relationship to Reynolds\u2019s replicated paintings and the literal engines of British industry. By following the chemicals, Painting with Fire remaps familiar stories about academic painting and pictorial experiment amid the industrialization of chemical knowledge.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226390253"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "022639025X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 281, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bRbEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bRbEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bRbEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bRbEDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Painting_with_Fire.html?hl=&id=bRbEDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bRbEDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rweMAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Ft+bmbhZVGc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rweMAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Oldest Living Things in the World", "authors": ["Rachel Sussman"], "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03", "description": "The Oldest Living Things in the World is an epic journey through time and space. Over the past decade, artist Rachel Sussman has researched, worked with biologists, and traveled the world to photograph continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older. Spanning from Antarctica to Greenland, the Mojave Desert to the Australian Outback, the result is a stunning and unique visual collection of ancient organisms unlike anything that has been created in the arts or sciences before, insightfully and accessibly narrated by Sussman along the way. Her work is both timeless and timely, and spans disciplines, continents, and millennia. It is underscored by an innate environmentalism and driven by Sussman\u2019s relentless curiosity. She begins at \u201cyear zero,\u201d and looks back from there, photographing the past in the present. These ancient individuals live on every continent and range from Greenlandic lichens that grow only one centimeter a century, to unique desert shrubs in Africa and South America, a predatory fungus in Oregon, Caribbean brain coral, to an 80,000-year-old colony of aspen in Utah. Sussman journeyed to Antarctica to photograph 5,500-year-old moss; Australia for stromatolites, primeval organisms tied to the oxygenation of the planet and the beginnings of life on Earth; and to Tasmania to capture a 43,600-year-old self-propagating shrub that\u2019s the last individual of its kind. Her portraits reveal the living history of our planet\u2014and what we stand to lose in the future. These ancient survivors have weathered millennia in some of the world\u2019s most extreme environments, yet climate change and human encroachment have put many of them in danger. Two of her subjects have already met with untimely deaths by human hands. Alongside the photographs, Sussman relays fascinating \u2013 and sometimes harrowing \u2013 tales of her global adventures tracking down her subjects and shares insights from the scientists who research them. The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of the past, a call to action in the present, and a barometer of our future.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226057644"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "022605764X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 170, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=52&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5284.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5284.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rweMAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5284600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5284600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Oldest_Living_Things_in_the_World-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rweMAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Yg_9Xqw4p_YC", "etag": "scJ98/1ByrA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Yg_9Xqw4p_YC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Fifty Fashion Looks that Changed the 1950s", "subtitle": "Design Museum Fifty", "authors": ["Design Museum Enterprise Limited", "Paula Reed"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2012-10-01", "description": "The Design Museum and fashion guru Paula Reed present Fifty Fashion Looks that Changed the 1950s.

It tells the story of four remarkable young men, the stresses, tensions and moral dilemmas of working in situations of extreme violence, pain and suffering, the relationships between the four and the story of the end of apartheid.

The results of this assault on Russian culture are particularly evident in ruined architectural monuments, some of which are little known even within Russia itself. Over the past four decades William Craft Brumfield, noted historian and photographer of Russian architecture, has traveled throughout Russia and photographed many of these neglected, lost buildings, poignant and haunting in their ruin. Lost Russia provides a unique view of Brumfield's acclaimed work, which illuminates Russian culture as reflected in these remnants of its distinctive architectural traditions. Capturing the quiet, ineffable beauty that graces these buildings, these photographs are accompanied by a text that provides not only a brief historical background for Russian architecture, but also Brumfield's personal impressions, thoughts, and insights on the structures he views. Churches and monasteries from the fifteenth to the twentieth century as well as abandoned, ruined manor houses are shown--ravaged by time, willful neglect, and cultural vandalism. Brumfield also illustrates examples of recent local initiatives to preserve cultural landmarks from steady decline and destruction. Concluding with photographs of the remarkable log architecture found in Russia's far north, Lost Russia is a book for all those concerned with the nation's cultural legacy, history, and architecture, and with historic and cultural preservation generally. It will also interest those who appreciate the fine art of exceptional photography.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0822315688"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780822315681"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 132, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z30lMS1VgOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z30lMS1VgOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Z30lMS1VgOUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=62&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Z30lMS1VgOUC&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Lost_Russia.html?hl=&id=Z30lMS1VgOUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lost_Russia-sample-epub.acsm?id=Z30lMS1VgOUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Z30lMS1VgOUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vJD6AwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Km/zxTHVUes", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vJD6AwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Abandoned Havana", "authors": ["Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo"], "publisher": "Restless Books", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14", "description": "Dissident Cuban writer, photographer, and pioneering blogger Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo presents a collection of surreal, irony-laden photos and texts from his native city.

Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo\u2019s photographs, and the commentaries they are accompanied with, capture whirlwinds of souls and offer them to us in such way that our own soul is transformed.

It is incredibly rare to find it in someone with no formal training and no network of peers.

Receiving little critical attention, biopics are regularly dismissed as superficial, formulaic, and disrespectful of history. Film critics, literary scholars and historians tend to believe that biopics should be artistic, yet accurate, true-to-life representations of their subjects. Moviegoing audiences, however, do not seem to hold similar views; biopics continue to be popular, commercially viable films. Even the genre\u2019s most ardent detractors will admit that these films are often very watchable, particularly due to the performance of the lead actor. It is increasingly common for stars of biographical films to garner critical praise and awards, driving a growing interest in scholarship in the genre. A Companion to the Biopic is the first global and authoritative reference on the subject. Offering theoretical, historical, thematic, and performance-based approaches, this unique volume brings together the work of top scholars to discuss the coverage of the lives of authors, politicians, royalty, criminals, and pop stars through the biopic film. Chapters explore evolving attitudes and divergent perspectives on the genre with topics such as the connections between biopics and literary melodramas, the influence financial concerns have on aesthetic, social, or moral principles, the merger of historical narratives with Hollywood biographies, stereotypes and criticisms of the biopic genre, and more. This volume: Provides a systematic, in-depth analysis of the biopic and considers how the choice of historical subject reflects contemporary issues Places emphasis on films that portray race and gender issues Explores the uneven boundaries of the genre by addressing what is and is not a biopic as well as the ways in which films simultaneously embrace and defy historical authenticity Examines the distinction between reality and \u2018the real\u2019 in biographical films Offers a chronological survey of biopics from the beginning of the 20th century A Companion to the Biopic is a valuable resource for researchers, scholars, and students of history, film studies, and English literature, as well as those in disciplines that examine interpretations of historical figures", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781119554813"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1119554810"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uj21DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uj21DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Uj21DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Uj21DwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Companion_to_the_Biopic.html?hl=&id=Uj21DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Uj21DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "diufDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "CR9oFzQfHO0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/diufDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Women of the 116th Congress", "subtitle": "Portraits of Power", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "publisher": "Abrams", "publishedDate": "2019-10-15", "description": "A celebration of the history-making women of the 116th Congress, who stand as a testament to what power looks and sounds like in 2019 The first woman Speaker of the House. The first female combat veteran. The first Native American women. The first Muslim women. The first openly gay member of the Senate. These are just some of the remarkable firsts represented by the women of the 116th Congress, the most diverse and inclusive in American history. Just over a century ago, Jeannette Rankin of Montana won a seat in the House of Representatives, becoming the first woman ever elected to federal office. In 1917, 128 years after the first United States Congress convened, she was sworn into its 65th session. One hundred and two years later, one has become 131\u2014the number of women serving in both chambers of the 116th Congress as of 2019. For most of recorded American history, political power has looked a certain way. But the 2018 midterm elections brought a seismic change. This book, a collaboration between New York Times photo editors Beth Flynn and and Marisa Schwartz Taylor and photographers Elizabeth D. Herman and Celeste Sloman, documents the women of the 116th Congress, photographed in the style of historical portrait paintings commonly seen in the halls of power to highlight the stark difference between how we\u2019ve historically viewed governance and how it has evolved. The Women of the 116th Congress features an illustrated timeline and list of firsts for women in Congress as well as \"Her Vote, Her Voice\" sections throughout that highlight historical moments in female politics. To provide more context around the origin of the photography, there is also an \"Inside the Times\" piece about how this project came about and was then turned into a book. Opening with an extended introduction and foreword by writer Roxane Gay and concluding with a removable poster featuring the congresswomen's portraits, this book profoundly captures the importance of this moment in history and will be a keepsake for years to come. The Women of the 116th Congress is a testament to what representation in the United States looks and sounds like in 2019\u2014and the possibilities of what it may look like in the years to come.",

Beautiful Photographs", "authors": ["Annie Griffiths"], "publisher": "National Geographic Books", "publishedDate": "2014-11-05", "description": "National Geographic Simply Beautiful Photographs takes readers on a spectacular visual journey through some of the most stunning photographs to be found in National Geographic\u2019s famed Image Collection. Award-winning photographer Annie Griffiths culled the images to reflect the many variations on the universal theme of beauty. Chapters are organized around the aesthetic concepts that create beauty in a photograph: Light, Composition, Moment (Gesture and Emotion), Motion, Palette, and Wonder. Beyond the introduction and brief essays about each featured concept, the text is light. The photographs speak for themselves, enhanced by lyrical quotes from scholars and poets. In the chapter on Light, for example, we read these words of whimsical wisdom from songwriter Leonard Cohen: \u201cRing the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering. There is a crack in everything. That's how the lights get in.\u201d And then the images flow, of light entering scenes through windows, clouds, and spotlights, from above, alongside, and behind, casting radiance upon young ballerinas and weathered men, into groves of autumn trees and island-dotted seas, revealing everything it touches to be beautiful beyond expectation. To illuminate the theme of Wonder, Griffiths chose a wish from Andre Bazin: \u201cIf I had influence with the good fairy...I should ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life.\u201d This thought is juxtaposed with an exquisite vision in white, a frame filled with the snowy-pure dots and rays of a bird\u2019s fan tail. And on it goes, picture after tantalizing picture, alive with wondrous beauty. When she created National Geographic Simply Beautiful Photographs, Annie Griffiths set two goals: to maximize visual delight, and to create a book unique in the world of publishing\u2014one in which many of the photographs could be purchased as prints. She has succeeded on both counts. Many of these stunning images are available for order, and there can be no doubt as to the visual delight. You must open this book for yourself, and take in its radiant beauty.

have drawn a good sketch. Unlike the graphite pencils, colored pencils cannot be easily erased, so we have to draw carefully, particularly the darker areas. Always draw parts with colored pencil pressing down lightly and if it looks good, color over the same area pressing down hard. Buy a good brand of colored pencils and smooth paper. If you don't have a lot of red pencils, you can get more variations with only one pencil, by controlling how hard you press when you draw. In the image below I've drawn with one red pencil three nuances. In the first example I pressed hard, in the second I pressed normally and in the third example I pressed lightly.

He moves on to cover topics such as:</p> <ul> <li> Balancing, mixing, and overpowering ambient light with artificial light</li> <li>Layering colors for unique color combinations</li> <li>Mixing hard and soft light to achieve extremely rich color</li> <li>Lighting detail and texture</li> <li>Modifier options, such as ring flash, snoots, barn doors, softboxes, and filters</li> <li>Gobos to control the light</li> <li>Post-processing for vibrant, powerful colors</li> <li>How (and why) to light with color, even when the end goal is a black and white image</li> </ul> <p>Illustrated throughout with innovative and expressive imagery, <i>Chroma</i> also includes behind-the-scenes photos, lighting diagrams, and Lightroom settings so you can follow along from the initial concept through to the final edit.</p> p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana; min-height: 13.0px}", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781681983127"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1681983125"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=90&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2466.85, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2466.85, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YitZDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2466850000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2466850000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chroma-sample-epub.acsm?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chroma-sample-pdf.acsm?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YitZDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8ddAAQAAQBAJ", "etag": "xCuYEmTsGR0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8ddAAQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Transforming Media Coverage of Violent Conflicts", "subtitle": "The New Face of War", "authors": ["Z.

His photographs of the Tarahumara, Huichol, Cora, Tepehuan, Southern Pima, and Tohono O'odham tribes of Mexico and southwest Arizona were among the very first taken of these cultures and still provide the best photographic record of them at the turn of the twentieth century. Lumholtz published his photographs in several books, including Unknown Mexico and New Trails in Mexico, but, because photographic publishing was then in its infancy, most of the images were poorly printed, badly cropped, or reworked by \"illustrators\" using crude techniques. Among Unknown Tribes presents more than two hundred of Lumholtz's best photographs\u2014many never before published\u2014from the archives of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, Norway. The images are newly scanned, most from the original negatives, and printed uncropped, disclosing a wealth of previously hidden detail. Each photograph is fully identified and often amplified by Lumholtz's own notes and captions. Accompanying the images are essays and photo notes that survey Lumholtz's career and legacy, as well as what his photographs reveal about the \"unknown tribes.\" By giving Lumholtz's photographs the high-quality reproduction they deserve, Among Unknown Tribes honors not only the Norwegian explorer but also the native peoples who continue to struggle for recognition and justice as they actively engage in the traditional customs that Lumholtz recorded.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780292754652"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0292754655"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 327, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0htQBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0htQBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0htQBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0htQBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0htQBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6453.97, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6453.97, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0htQBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0htQBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6453970000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6453970000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0htQBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DXK5gkQwAs8C", "etag": "10f/8evdcFw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DXK5gkQwAs8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "World on Film", "subtitle": "An Introduction", "authors": ["Martha Nochimson"], "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons", "publishedDate": "2010-02-22", "description": "This uniquely engaging and lively textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to international film, from the golden age of European cinema to the contemporary blockbusters of India and Asia, and the post World War II emergence of global film culture.

Author Margot Mifflin notes that women\u2019s interest in tattoos surged in the suffragist 20s and the feminist 70s. She chronicles: * Breast cancer survivors of the 90s who tattoo their mastectomy scars as an alternative to reconstructive surgery or prosthetics. * The parallel rise of tattooing and cosmetic surgery during the 80s when women tattooists became soul doctors to a nation afflicted with body anxieties. * Maud Wagner, the first known woman tattooist, who in 1904 traded a date with her tattooist husband-to-be for an apprenticeship. * Victorian society women who wore tattoos as custom couture, including Winston Churchill\u2019s mother, who wore a serpent on her wrist. * Nineteeth-century sideshow attractions who created fantastic abduction tales in which they claimed to have been forcibly tattooed. \u201cIn Bodies of Subversion, Margot Mifflin insightfully chronicles the saga of skin as signage. Through compelling anecdotes and cleverly astute analysis, she shows and tells us new histories about women, tattoos, public pictures, and private parts.

During her increasingly long lunch breaks, she began to obsessively read the PennySaver, the iconic clas\u00adsifieds booklet that reached everywhere and seemed to come from nowhere. Who was the person selling the \"Large leather Jacket, $10\"? It seemed important to find out - or at least it was a great distraction from the screenplay. Accompanied by photographer Brigitte Sire, July crisscrossed Los Angeles to meet a random selection of PennySaver sellers, glimpsing thirteen surprisingly moving and profoundly specific realities, along the way shaping her film, and herself, in unexpected ways. Elegantly blending narrative, interviews, and photographs with July's off-kilter honesty and deadpan humour, this is a story of procrastination and inspiration, isolation and connection, and grabbing hold of the invisible world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780857862839"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0857862839"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 224, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.4.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=98&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 678.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 339.25, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&rdid=book-jo5LHNq2ZBkC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 678500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 339250000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/It_Chooses_You-sample-epub.acsm?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/It_Chooses_You-sample-pdf.acsm?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jo5LHNq2ZBkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_kbRUmMrZycC", "etag": "iRWKoW+sLmE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_kbRUmMrZycC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Basics Photography 01: Composition", "authors": ["David Prakel"], "publisher": "AVA Publishing", "publishedDate": "2006-06-01", "description": "One of AVA's most successful publications to date, Basics Photography 01: Composition teaches the formal elements of composition, how to organize space within the photographic frame, and how to apply composition in real-world situations.

If you're not obsessed yourself, you know someone who is. Within a few years, keeping backyard chooks has gone from being something your nonna did, to the mainstream. Chickens are in inner-city backyards and comedy gigs, old people's homes and poultry shows, prisons and weddings. Regional poultry clubs have been revitalised by the influx of tree-changers and hipsters intoxicated with exotic heritage breeds.Rescue chickens are the new black, and the perfect feel-good accompaniment to your rescue dog. Chickens are an essential component of the permaculture, locavore, sustainability, self-sufficiency and low food mile movements. Chickens are owning Instagram. Chickens are everywhere. A collaboration between writer, comic and chicken owner, Fiona Scott-Norman, and acclaimed photographer, Ilana Rose, This Chicken Life is a collection of stories about chickens and the Australians who love them. You'll meet Jareth Bullivant, an animal liberationist who takes his rescue broilers Twistie and Sephiroth to the beach.

Together, this volume and its predecessor, Pioneer Photographers of the Far West: A Biographical Dictionary, 1840-1865, comprise an exhaustive survey of early photographers in North America and Central America, excluding the eastern United States and eastern Canada. This work is distinguished by the large number of entries, by the appealing narratives that cover both professional and private lives of the subjects, and by the painstaking documentation. It will be an essential reference work for historians, libraries, and museums, as well as for collectors of and dealers in early American photography. In addition to photographers, the book includes photographic printers, retouchers, and colorists, and manufacturers and sellers of photographic apparatus and stock.

Pete Souza was with President Obama during more crucial moments than anyone else and he photographed them all - from the highly classified to the disarmingly candid. Obama: An Intimate Portrait reproduces more than three hundred of Souza's most iconic photographs in exquisite detail, some of which have never been published before. Souza's photographs, with the behind-the-scenes captions and stories that accompany them, document the most consequential hours of the Presidency alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his encounters with children, interactions with world leaders and cultural figures, and more.

It studies peoples that speak Austronesian languages and offers a detailed comparison of their homogeneous and heterogeneous cultures of color, clothing, housing, boats, birds, symbols, dance and ancestry, and provides insights into the cultural features of deconstruction and construction of color, style, form, shape and function, to compose cultural and creative products using complex, variable, fuzzy evaluation; and structural variation and color evaluation methods. It then uses case studies to show that the products created with the new model not only fulfilled their purpose, but also successfully entered the markets. This book helps qualify decision-making processes, improve accuracy of design scheme evaluation and enhance efficiency in product development, and as such appeals to those in the cultural and creative industry, researchers, designers and those who are interested in product design.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789811522710"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9811522715"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 153, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Photography&hl=&cd=113&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6301.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6301.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UtTHDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6301200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6301200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cultural_Realism_and_Virtualism_Design_M-sample-epub.acsm?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cultural_Realism_and_Virtualism_Design_M-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UtTHDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "1rUQsBbCUhYC", "etag": "xcb+VS8PWUg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1rUQsBbCUhYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Photography: A Very Short Introduction", "authors": ["Steve Edwards"], "publisher": "OUP Oxford", "publishedDate": "2006-08-24", "description": "Photographs are an integral part of our daily lives from sensationalist images in tabloid papers and snapshots, to art photograpy displayed in galleries and sold through international art markets. In this thought-provoking exploration of the subject, Edwards combines a sense of the historical development of photography with an analysis of its purpose and meaning within a wider cultural context. He interrogates the way we look and think about photographs, and considers such issues as truth and recording, objectivity and fine art, identity and memory.
