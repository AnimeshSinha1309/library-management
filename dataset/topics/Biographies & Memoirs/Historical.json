Barnum. Some laws teach the need for prudence (\u201cLaw 1: Never Outshine the Master\u201d), others teach the value of confidence (\u201cLaw 28: Enter Action with Boldness\u201d), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (\u201cLaw 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally\u201d).

No one, honey. The truth is, it hasn\u2019t always been gorgeous for this beacon of positivity and joy. Before he stole our hearts as the grooming and self-care expert on Netflix\u2019s hit show Queer Eye, Jonathan was growing up in a small Midwestern town that didn\u2019t understand why he was so\u2026over the top. From choreographed carpet figure skating routines to the unavoidable fact that he was Just. So. Gay., Jonathan was an easy target and endured years of judgement, ridicule and trauma - yet none of it crushed his uniquely effervescent spirit. Over the Top uncovers the pain and passion it took to end up becoming the model of self-love and acceptance that Jonathan is today. In this revelatory, raw, and rambunctious memoir, Jonathan shares never-before-told secrets and reveals sides of himself that the public has never seen. JVN fans may think they know the man behind the stiletto heels, the crop tops, and the iconic sayings, but there\u2019s much more to him than meets the Queer Eye. You\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll cry, and you\u2019ll come away knowing that no matter how broken or lost you may be, you\u2019re a Kelly Clarkson song, you\u2019re strong, and you\u2019ve got this.",

Powerful and shaming' GUARDIAN Polly, Annie, Elizabeth, Catherine and Mary-Jane are famous for the same thing, though they never met. They came from Fleet Street, Knightsbridge, Wolverhampton, Sweden and Wales. They wrote ballads, ran coffee houses, lived on country estates, they breathed ink-dust from printing presses and escaped people-traffickers. What they had in common was the year of their murders: 1888. Their murderer was never identified, but the name created for him by the press has become far more famous than any of these five women. Now, in this devastating narrative of five lives, historian Hallie Rubenhold finally sets the record straight, and gives these women back their stories.

Kinkley"], "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18", "description": "The depiction of personal and collective suffering in modern Chinese novels differs significantly from standard Communist accounts and many Eastern and Western historical narratives. Writers such as Yu Hua, Su Tong, Wang Anyi, Mo Yan, Han Shaogong, Ge Fei, Li Rui, and Zhang Wei skew and scramble common conceptions of China's modern development, deploying avant-garde narrative techniques from Latin American and Euro-American modernism to project a surprisingly \"un-Chinese\" dystopian vision and critical view of human culture and ethics. The epic narratives of modern Chinese fiction make rich use of magical realism, surrealism, and unusual treatments of historical time. Also featuring graphic depictions of sex and violence, as well as dark, raunchy comedy, these novels reflect China's recent history re-presenting the overthrow of the monarchy in the early twentieth century and the resulting chaos of revolution and war; the recurring miseries perpetrated by class warfare during the dictatorship of Mao Zedong; and the social dislocations caused by China's industrialization and rise as a global power. This book casts China's highbrow historical novels from the late 1980s to the first decade of the twenty-first century as a distinctively Chinese contribution to the form of the global dystopian novel and, consequently, to global thinking about the interrelations of utopia and dystopia.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231532297"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231532296"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0pboBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0pboBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0pboBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA266&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0pboBAAAQBAJ&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Visions_of_Dystopia_in_China_s_New_Histo.html?hl=&id=0pboBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Visions_of_Dystopia_in_China_s_New_Histo-sample-epub.acsm?id=0pboBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Visions_of_Dystopia_in_China_s_New_Histo-sample-pdf.acsm?id=0pboBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0pboBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "See <b>biographies</b> and <b>autobiographies</b>; <b>memoirs</b> and <b>autobiographies</b> (Chinese) <br>\navant-garde, 183, 184; Chinese, x, xiii, 8\u201310, 29\u201331, 34, 36, 75,202, 203; Ge Fei <br>\nas, 30, 75,227n29; Li Rui as, 31, 225n6; Liu Zhenyun as, 203; Mo Yan as, 30,&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y203AQAAMAAJ", "etag": "Eitm7YN1zcY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y203AQAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biographical Memoirs of Blackford County, Ind", "subtitle": "To which is Appended a Comprehensive Compendium of National Biography ...

In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. When their ship was finally crushed between two ice floes, they attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization.

Perhaps best known for the Whig slogan in 1840\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dHarrison used his efforts to pacify Native Americans and defeat the British in the War of 1812 to promote a political career that eventually elevated him to the presidency. Harrison exemplified the citizen-soldier on the Ohio frontier in the days when white men settled on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains at their peril. Punctuated by almost continuous small-scale operations and sporadic larger engagements, warfare in this region revolved around a shifting system of alliances among various Indian tribes, government figures, white settlers, and business leaders. Skaggs focuses on Harrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early life and military exploits, especially his role on Major General Anthony Wayne's staff during the Fallen Timbers campaign and Harrison's leadership of the Tippecanoe campaign. He explores how the military and its leaders performed in the age of a small standing army and part-time, Cincinnatus-like forces. This richly detailed work reveals how the military and Indian policies of the early republic played out on the frontier, freshly revisiting a subject central to American history: how white settlers tamed the west\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand at what cost. -- Andrew Cayton, Miami University", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781421411750"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "142141175X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 328, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA247&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=52&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3958.97, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3958.97, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3958970000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3958970000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/William_Henry_Harrison_and_the_Conquest-sample-epub.acsm?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/William_Henry_Harrison_and_the_Conquest-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Lq0AAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "(Indianapolis: Indiana <b>Historical</b> Society, 1942), 2:829. 2. \u201c<b>Biographical Memoirs</b> <br>\nof Major Gen.

These include his prose fiction and poetry, his work as an historian and natural historian, and his relationship to the other arts, most notably his painting. It is concerned with both lasting works of literary and dramatic criticism, as well as reviews of his books and plays in the theatre, and some more ephemeral material, all of this in several languages. Organised generically and by subject and individual work, the bibliography enables the reader to trace the changing impact of Strindberg and his works in various countries and during different periods. It is thus very much a study in reception as well as a bibliographical record of published material. It traces the developing image of Strindberg and his writing both during his lifetime and in subsequent years, and with frequent cross reference offers a comprehensive overview of a literary and existential project that has rarely been matched for its multifaceted diversity. The bibliography is published in three parts. Volume 1, General Studies (978-0-947623-81-4) and Volume 2, The Plays (978-0-947623-82-1) are also now available.

This study articulates an approach to using memoirs as instruments of historical understanding. Jennifer Jensen Wallach applies these principles to a body of memoirs about life in the American South during Jim Crow segregation, including works by Zora Neale Hurston, Willie Morris, Lillian Smith, Henry Louis Gates Jr., William Alexander Percy, and Richard Wright. Wallach argues that the field of autobiography studies, which is currently dominated by literary critics, needs a new theoretical framework that allows historians, too, to benefit from the interpretation of life writing. Her most provocative claim is that, due to the aesthetic power of literary language, skilled creative writers are uniquely positioned to capture the complexities of another time and another place. Through techniques such as metaphor and irony, memoirists collectively give their readers an empathetic understanding of life during the era of segregation. Although these reminiscences bear certain similarities, it becomes clear that the South as it was remembered by each is hardly the same place.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0820337021"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780820337029"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8P1P51i-YfQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8P1P51i-YfQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8P1P51i-YfQC&pg=PA23&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=61&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8P1P51i-YfQC&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Closer_to_the_Truth_Than_Any_Fact.html?hl=&id=8P1P51i-YfQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Closer_to_the_Truth_Than_Any_Fact-sample-epub.acsm?id=8P1P51i-YfQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Closer_to_the_Truth_Than_Any_Fact-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8P1P51i-YfQC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8P1P51i-YfQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The <b>historical</b> study of <b>memoirs</b> is embedded in a belief that the <b>memoir</b> refers to <br>\na real (and to some extent knowable) past and ... 34 Although <b>biographies</b> and <br>\nhistoriographical writing may describe the events of an individual&#39;s life, they are ill<br>\n&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sDIhyY3Y59UC", "etag": "Ek7qQLAGinI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sDIhyY3Y59UC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "History of Social Work in the United Kingdom: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide", "authors": ["Oxford University Press"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "publishedDate": "2010-05-01", "description": "This ebook is a selective guide designed to help scholars and students of social work find reliable sources of information by directing them to the best available scholarly materials in whatever form or format they appear from books, chapters, and journal articles to online archives, electronic data sets, and blogs.

Bucktoothed and hampered by shyness, Ripley turned his sense of being an outsider into an appreciation of the weird and wonderful. He sold his first cartoon to LIFE magazine at eighteen, but it was his wildly popular \u2018Believe It or Not!\u2019 radio shows that won him international fame, and spurred him on to search the globe\u2019s farthest corners for bizarre facts, human curiosities and shocking phenomena. Ripley delighted in making preposterous declarations that somehow turned out to be true \u2013 such as that Charles Lindburgh was only the sixty-seventh man to fly across the Atlantic or that \u2018The Star Spangled Banner\u2019 was not the USA\u2019s national anthem. And he demanded respect for those who were labelled \u2018eccentrics\u2019 or \u2018freaks\u2019 \u2013 whether it be E. L. Blystone, who wrote 2,871 alphabet letters on a grain of rice, or the man who could swallow his own nose. By the 1930s, Ripley possessed a wide fortune, a private yacht and a huge mansion stocked with such oddities as shrunken heads and medieval torture devices.

His work, conceived overall as a Critique of Historical Reason and developed through his well-known theory of the human studies, provides concepts and methods still fruitful for those concerned with analyzing the human condition. Despite the increasing recognition of Dilthey's contributions, relati vely few of his writings have as yet appeared in English translation. It is therefore both timely and useful to have available here two works drawn from different phases in the development of his philosophy. The \"Ideas Concerning a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology\" (1894), now translated into English for the first time, sets forth Dilthey's programma tic and methodological viewpoints through a descriptive psychology, while \"The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Expressions of Life\" (ca. 1910) is representative of his later hermeneutic approach to historical understanding. DESCRIPTIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND THE HUMAN STUDIES Dilthey presented the first mature statement of his theory of the human studies in volume one of his Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften (Introduction to the Human Studies), published in 1883. He argued there that for the proper study of man and history we must eschew the metaphysical speculation of the absolute idealists while at the same time avoiding the scientistic reduction of positivism.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400996588"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400996586"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 147, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA63&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ILmLBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Descriptive_Psychology_and_Historical_Un-sample-epub.acsm?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Descriptive_Psychology_and_Historical_Un-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ILmLBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... and semantic evolution of words, in the modifications of the ideas which <br>\nbecome attached to the name of God. <b>Biographies</b>, <b>memoirs</b>, letters, then inform <br>\nus of the inner events which illuminate the genesis of determinate forms of <br>\nspiritual life."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cnfT1YnW7ZsC", "etag": "I7wuwMmirCE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cnfT1YnW7ZsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Historical Jesus of the Gospels", "authors": ["Craig S.

At a time when women were expected to be homemakers, she set her sights on Stanford University. When she graduated near the top of her law school class in 1952, no firm would even interview her. But Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s story is that of a woman who repeatedly shattered glass ceilings\u2014doing so with a blend of grace, wisdom, humor, understatement, and cowgirl toughness. She became the first ever female majority leader of a state senate. As a judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she stood up to corrupt lawyers and humanized the law. When she arrived at the United States Supreme Court, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, she began a quarter-century tenure on the Court, hearing cases that ultimately shaped American law. Diagnosed with cancer at fifty-eight, and caring for a husband with Alzheimer\u2019s, O\u2019Connor endured every difficulty with grit and poise. Women and men who want to be leaders and be first in their own lives\u2014who want to learn when to walk away and when to stand their ground\u2014will be inspired by O\u2019Connor\u2019s example. This is a remarkably vivid and personal portrait of a woman who loved her family, who believed in serving her country, and who, when she became the most powerful woman in America, built a bridge forward for all women.

Not only have historians challenged the national narrative on the basis of their rich explorations of the personal, the social, the economic, and the political, but they have also entered into dialogues with each other over the meaning of women's history itself. In this collection of seventeen original essays on women's lives from the colonial period to the present, contributors take the competing forces of race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, and region into account. Among many other examples, they examine how conceptions of gender shaped government officials' attitudes towards East Asian immigrants; how race and gender inequality pervaded the welfare state; and how color and class shaped Mexican American women's mobilization for civil and labor rights.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780813541815"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0813541816"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 370, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&pg=PA308&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Practice_of_U_S_Women_s_History.html?hl=&id=ulvSg95OZ3EC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Practice_of_U_S_Women_s_History-sample-epub.acsm?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ulvSg95OZ3EC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "...

The esteem in which the History was held transcended religious divisions. The historian received letters of praise from staunchly orthodox Spain and Portugal as well as from heretic England and Germany; through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries his History was read with enthusi asm by certain cardinals at the very curia which condemned it; and so staunch a champion of orthodoxy as Bishop Bossuet did not hesitate to appeal to \"such a great author\" for support in his own historical works. !

Chronicling General Lafayette\u2019s years in Washington\u2019s army, Vowell reflects on the ideals of the American Revolution versus the reality of the Revolutionary War. Riding shotgun with Lafayette, Vowell swerves from the high-minded debates of Independence Hall to the frozen wasteland of Valley Forge, from bloody battlefields to the Palace of Versailles, bumping into John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Lord Cornwallis, Benjamin Franklin, Marie Antoinette and various kings, Quakers and redcoats along the way. Drawn to the patriots\u2019 war out of a lust for glory, Enlightenment ideas and the traditional French hatred for the British, young Lafayette crossed the Atlantic expecting to join forces with an undivided people, encountering instead fault lines between the Continental Congress and the Continental Army, rebel and loyalist inhabitants, and a conspiracy to fire George Washington, the one man holding together the rickety, seemingly doomed patriot cause. While Vowell\u2019s yarn is full of the bickering and infighting that marks the American past\u2014and present\u2014her telling of the Revolution is just as much a story of friendship: between Washington and Lafayette, between the Americans and their French allies and, most of all between Lafayette and the American people. Coinciding with one of the most contentious presidential elections in American history, Vowell lingers over the elderly Lafayette\u2019s sentimental return tour of America in 1824, when three fourths of the population of New York City turned out to welcome him ashore. As a Frenchman and the last surviving general of the Continental Army, Lafayette belonged to neither North nor South, to no political party or faction. He was a walking, talking reminder of the sacrifices and bravery of the revolutionary generation and what the founders hoped this country could be. His return was not just a reunion with his beloved Americans it was a reunion for Americans with their own astonishing, singular past. Vowell\u2019s narrative look at our somewhat united states is humorous, irreverent and wholly original.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781101624012"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1101624019"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 23, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "3.6.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=85&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 945.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 472.58, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-q-pJBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 945160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 472580000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lafayette_in_the_Somewhat_United_States-sample-epub.acsm?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=q-pJBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Chronicling General Lafayette\u2019s years in Washington\u2019s army, Vowell reflects on the ideals of the American Revolution versus the reality of the Revolutionary War."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QBodBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "LBba8UjXXvw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QBodBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "British Women Writers of the Romantic Period", "subtitle": "An Anthology of Their Literary Criticism", "authors": ["Mary A.

In Consuming History, Jerome de Groot examines how society consumes history and how a reading of this consumption can help us understand popular culture and issues of representation. This book analyzes a wide range of cultural entities \u2013 from computer games to daytime television, from blockbuster fictional narratives such as Da Vinci Code to DNA genealogical tools \u2013 to analyze how history works in contemporary popular culture. Jerome de Groot probes how museums have responded to the heritage debate and the way in which new technologies have brought about a shift in access to history, from online game playing to internet genealogy. He discusses the often conflicted relationship between \u2018public\u2019 and academic history, and raises important questions about the theory and practice of history as a discipline.

After thirteen days of fighting, American legends Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett died there, along with other Americans who had moved to Texas looking for a fresh start. It was a crushing blow to Texas\u2019s fight for freedom. But the story doesn\u2019t end there.

By the time of his death at the age of 90 in 1965, many thought him to be the greatest man in the world. There have been over a thousand previous biographies of Churchill. Andrew Roberts now draws on over forty new sources, including the private diaries of King George VI, used in no previous Churchill biography to depict him more intimately and persuasively than any of its predecessors. The book in no way conceals Churchill's faults and it allows the reader to appreciate his virtues and character in full: his titanic capacity for work (and drink), his ability see the big picture, his willingness to take risks and insistence on being where the action was, his good humour even in the most desperate circumstances, the breadth and strength of his friendships and his extraordinary propensity to burst into tears at unexpected moments. Above all, it shows us the wellsprings of his personality - his lifelong desire to please his father (even long after his father's death) but aristocratic disdain for the opinions of almost everyone else, his love of the British Empire, his sense of history and its connection to the present. During the Second World War, Churchill summoned a particular scientist to see him several times for technical advice. 'It was the same whenever we met', wrote the young man, 'I had a feeling of being recharged by a source of living power.' Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt's emissary, wrote 'Wherever he was, there was a battlefront.' Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, Churchill's essential partner in strategy and most severe critic in private, wrote in his diary, 'I thank God I was given such an opportunity of working alongside such a man, and of having my eyes opened to the fact that occasionally supermen exist on this earth.'", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780241205648"}, {"type": "ISBN_10",

recognised by critics as a masterful achievement, one that was 'unlikely to be surpassed' (Sunday Telegraph). Since that time however a considerable amount of new material has come to light and the passing of time has allowed a new candour. John Gielgud: Matinee Idol to Movie Star sees this peerless biographer return to his subject to offer the definitive life of Gielgud. For this new biography Croall's exhaustive research has included over a hundred new interviews with key people from his life and career, several hundred letters from Gielgud that have never been published, scores of letters written to him and archived versions of his film and television work. As Gielgud worked increasingly in this medium during the last third of his life much greater attention is given to this than in the earlier work. Fresh light is thrown on his professional relationships with figures such as Laurence Olivier and Edith Evans, and on turbulent episodes of his private life. The overall result is a a much more rounded, candid and richly textured portrait of this celebrated and complex actor.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781408131077"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1408131072"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 736, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "5.9.8.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&pg=PT661&dq=Historical+biographies+memoirs&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1953, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1953, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&rdid=book-Qy-M1O53kdYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1953000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1953000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/John_Gielgud_Matinee_Idol_to_Movie_Star-sample-epub.acsm?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/John_Gielgud_Matinee_Idol_to_Movie_Star-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Qy-M1O53kdYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "5 COWARD AND CHEKHOV <b>Biographies</b>: Coward/Hoare, Agate/Harding. <br>\nGielgud, Notes from the ... <b>Biographies</b>: Peter Parker, Ackerley (Constable, 1989). <br>\nEleanor Adlard (ed.) ... 9 HAMLET AT THE VIC <b>Memoirs</b>: Harcourt Williams, Four <br>\nYears at the Old Vic, Old Vic Saga. <b>Biographies</b>: ... 14 SAINTDENIS AND <br>\nHITCHCOCK John Elsom, Nicholas Tomalin, The <b>History</b> of the National Theatre. <br>\n<b>Biographies</b>:&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ORFkDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "qui+F2b9Cf0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ORFkDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Complete History of the Women's Suffrage Movement in U.S. (Including Biographies & Memoirs of Most Influential Suffragettes)", "authors": ["Jane Addams", "Elizabeth Cady Stanton", "Ida Husted Harper", "Anna Howard Shaw", "Matilda Gage", "Susan B.

A fascination that began with reading Our Island Story and her evacuation to an Elizabethan manor house at the beginning of the Second World War soon developed into an enduring passion, becoming, in her own words, 'an essential part of the enjoyment of life'. My History follows Antonia's relationship with her family: she was the eldest of eight children. Her parents Frank and Elizabeth Pakenham, later Lord and Lady Longford, were both Labour politicians. Then there are her adventures as a self-made debutante before Oxford University and a fortunate coincidence that leads to her working in publishing. It closes with the publication of her first major historical work, Mary Queen of Scots - a book that became a worldwide bestseller.

Geoffrey C. Ward, distilling more than thirty years of thinking and writing about the Roosevelts, and the acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns help us understand for the first time that, despite the fierce partisanship of their eras, the Roosevelts were far more united than divided. All the history the Roosevelts made is here, but this is primarily an intimate account, the story of three people who overcame obstacles that would have undone less forceful personalities. Theodore Roosevelt would push past childhood frailty, outpace depression, survive terrible grief\u2014and transform the office of the presidency. Eleanor Roosevelt, orphaned and alone as a child, would endure her husband\u2019s betrayal, battle her own self-doubts, and remake herself into the most consequential first lady in American history\u2014and the most admired woman on earth. And Franklin Roosevelt, born to privilege and so pampered that most of his youthful contemporaries dismissed him as a charming lightweight, would summon the strength to lead the nation through the two greatest crises since the Civil War, though he could not take a single step unaided. The three were towering personalities, but The Roosevelts shows that they were also flawed human beings who confronted in their personal lives issues familiar to all of us: anger and the need for forgiveness, courage and cowardice, confidence and self-doubt, loyalty to family and the need to be true to oneself.

Late in life, Winston Churchill claimed that victory in the Second World War would have been \u201cimpossible\u201d without the woman who stood by his side for fifty-seven turbulent years. Why, then, do we know so little about her? In this landmark biography, a finalist for the Plutarch prize, Sonia Purnell finally gives Clementine Churchill her due.

Many wondered why Winston married her, when the prime minister\u2019s daughter was desperate for his attention. Yet their marriage proved to be an exceptional partnership. \"You know,\"Winston confided to FDR, \"I tell Clemmie everything.\" Through the ups and downs of his tumultuous career, in the tense days when he stood against Chamberlain and the many months when he helped inspire his fellow countrymen and women to keep strong and carry on, Clementine made her husband\u2019s career her mission, at the expense of her family, her health and, fatefully, of her children.

Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power gives us Jefferson the politician and president, a great and complex human being forever engaged in the wars of his era. Philosophers think; politicians maneuver. Jefferson\u2019s genius was that he was both and could do both, often simultaneously. Such is the art of power. Thomas Jefferson hated confrontation, and yet his understanding of power and of human nature enabled him to move men and to marshal ideas, to learn from his mistakes, and to prevail. Passionate about many things\u2014women, his family, books, science, architecture, gardens, friends, Monticello, and Paris\u2014Jefferson loved America most, and he strove over and over again, despite fierce opposition, to realize his vision: the creation, survival, and success of popular government in America. Jon Meacham lets us see Jefferson\u2019s world as Jefferson himself saw it, and to appreciate how Jefferson found the means to endure and win in the face of rife partisan division, economic uncertainty, and external threat. Drawing on archives in the United States, England, and France, as well as unpublished Jefferson presidential papers, Meacham presents Jefferson as the most successful political leader of the early republic, and perhaps in all of American history. The father of the ideal of individual liberty, of the Louisiana Purchase, of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and of the settling of the West, Jefferson recognized that the genius of humanity\u2014and the genius of the new nation\u2014lay in the possibility of progress, of discovering the undiscovered and seeking the unknown. From the writing of the Declaration of Independence to elegant dinners in Paris and in the President\u2019s House; from political maneuverings in the boardinghouses and legislative halls of Philadelphia and New York to the infant capital on the Potomac; from his complicated life at Monticello, his breathtaking house and plantation in Virginia, to the creation of the University of Virginia, Jefferson was central to the age. Here too is the personal Jefferson, a man of appetite, sensuality, and passion. The Jefferson story resonates today not least because he led his nation through ferocious partisanship and cultural warfare amid economic change and external threats, and also because he embodies an eternal drama, the struggle of the leadership of a nation to achieve greatness in a difficult and confounding world.

Behind the legend, there was a man. In 1120 the wife of a Norman draper's merchant gave birth to a baby boy in London's bustling Cheapside. Despite his sickly constitution, middle-class background and unremarkable abilities, he rose within the space of thirty-five years to become the most powerful man in the kingdom, second only to Henry II himself. At his height, he led seven hundred knights into battle, brokered peace between nations, held the ear of the Pope and brought one of the strongest rulers in Christendom to his knees. And within three years of his bloody assassination, he was a saint whose cult had spread the length and breadth of Europe, and a legend who remains as controversial and compelling today as he was during his life. The story of Thomas Becket is the story of an enigma, as well as of one of the most tumultuous periods in English history. Drawing on a vast array of contemporary records, personal letters and first-hand accounts, John Guy has reconstructed a psychologically compelling, stunningly nuanced and utterly convincing account of this most remarkable man, the dramatic times in which he lived and the pivotal role he played in his nation's history. 'Lively, effortlessly readable, superb. A triumph' The Times 'Suspenseful, meticulously researched . . . however well you think you know the story, it is well worth the read' Financial Times 'Wonderfully moving and subtle. Reading of the assassination is almost unbearably intense and brings tears to one's eye' Daily Express 'Compelling, marvellously measured, entertainingly astute, and in places positively moving' The Independent 'A beautifully layered portrait of one of the most complex characters in English history . . . not only corrects many historical errors and uncertainties, but merits reading more than once, for the sheer joy of its superb storytelling' The Times 'Scintillates with energetic scene-setting, giving us a tactile, visual feel for early medieval England . . . breathes new life into an oft-told tale' Financial Times 'Vivid and extremely readable. The most accessible Life of Thomas Becket to be published in recent years' The Times Literary Supplement John Guy is an award-winning historian, accomplished broadcaster and a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge.
