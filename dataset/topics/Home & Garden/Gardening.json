Larry Korn, who apprenticed with Mr. Fukuoka in Japan at the time, translated the manuscript and brought it to the United States, knowing it would change the conversation about food forever. The One-Straw Revolution, edited by Korn and Wendell Berry, was an immediate international success, and established Mr. Fukuoka as a leading voice in the fight against conventional industrial agriculture. In this new book, through his own personal narrative, Larry Korn distills his experience of more than thirty-five years of study with Mr. Fukuoka, living and working on his farm on Shikoku Island, and traveling with Mr. Fukuoka to the United States on two six-week visits. One-Straw Revolutionary is the first book to look deeply at natural farming and intimately discuss the philosophy and work of Mr. Fukuoka. In addition to giving his personal thoughts about natural farming, Korn broadens the discussion by pointing out natural farming\u2019s kinship with the ways of indigenous cultures and traditional Japanese farming. At the same time, he clearly distinguishes natural farming from other forms of agriculture, including scientific and organic agriculture and permaculture. Korn also clarifies commonly held misconceptions about natural farming in ways Western readers can readily understand. And he explains how natural farming can be used practically in areas other than agriculture, including personal growth and development. The book follows the author on his travels from one back-to-the-land commune to another in the countryside of 1970s Japan, a journey that eventually led him to Mr. Fukuoka\u2019s natural farm. Korn\u2019s description of his time there, as well as traveling with Mr. Fukuoka during his visits to the United States, offers a rare, inside look at Mr. Fukuoka\u2019s life. Readers will delight in this personal insight into one of the world\u2019s leading agricultural thinkers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603585316"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603585311"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1186.37, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 593.18, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1186370000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 593180000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/One_Straw_Revolutionary-sample-epub.acsm?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/One_Straw_Revolutionary-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Rh1mCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rgepAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "a3dRH4LBUE8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rgepAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Southwest Fruit & Vegetable Gardening", "subtitle": "Plant, Grow, and Harvest the Best Edibles - Arizona, Nevada & New Mexico", "authors": ["Jacqueline Soule"], "publishedDate": "2014-07-15", "description": "DIVMaster the art of edible gardening in the beautiful southwestern United States./divDIV /divDIVSouthwest Fruit & Vegetable Gardening is written exclusively for gardeners who want to grow edibles in Arizona, New Mexico, or Nevada.

However, viewed through a different lens, they can also be seen as a tremendous source of opportunity. Access to land is a major barrier for many people who want to enter the agricultural sector, and urban and suburban yards have huge potential for would-be farmers wanting to become part of this growing movement. The Urban Farmer is a comprehensive, hands-on, practical manual to help you learn the techniques and business strategies you need to make a good living growing high-yield, high-value crops right in your own backyard (or someone else's). Major benefits include: Low capital investment and overhead costs Reduced need for expensive infrastructure Easy access to markets. Growing food in the city means that fresh crops may travel only a few blocks from field to table, making this innovative approach the next logical step in the local food movement.

Bushnell"], "publisher": "Cornell University Press", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "For Rebecca Bushnell, English gardening books tell a fascinating tale of the human love for plants and our will to make them do as we wish. These books powerfully evoke the desires of gardeners: they show us gardeners who, like poets, imagine not just what is but what should be. In particular, the earliest English garden books, such as Thomas Hill's The Gardener's Labyrinth or Hugh Platt's Floraes Paradise, mix magical practices with mundane recipes even when the authors insist that they rely completely on their own experience in these matters. Like early modern \"books of secrets,\" early gardening manuals often promise the reader power to alter the essential properties of plants: to make the gillyflower double, to change the lily's hue, or to grow a cherry without a stone. Green Desire describes the innovative design of the old manuals, examining how writers and printers marketed them as fiction as well as practical advice for aspiring gardeners. Along with this attention to the delights of reading, it analyzes the strange dignity and pleasure of garden labor and the division of men's and women's roles in creating garden art. The book ends by recounting the heated debate over how much people could do to create marvels in their own gardens. For writers and readers alike, these green desires inspired dreams of power and self-improvement, fantasies of beauty achieved without work, and hopes for order in an unpredictable world--not so different from the dreams of gardeners today.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801441439"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801441431"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 198, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Green_Desire.html?hl=&id=4FAyxoRJVJEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "z_mODwAAQBAJ", "etag": "TW+gGf9OjZ0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/z_mODwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The World of Ficus Bonsai", "authors": ["Jerry Meislik"], "publisher": "FriesenPress", "publishedDate": "2019-02-22", "description": "Jerry Meislik is a well-known bonsai lecturer, demonstrator, teacher and writer. He has written articles for many of the major bonsai publications including Bonsai Journal of the American Bonsai Society and Bonsai Clubs International magazine. Jerry maintains a very active bonsai web site at www.bonsaihunk.us. There are more than 70 articles written by Jerry in various online forums and groups. The author is an acknowledged expert on the genus Ficus as it is applied to the growing of bonsai. He previous book on Figs, Ficus: The Exotic Bonsai was printed in both hard and soft cover editions. This prior book was used as the start and backbone of this new book The World of Ficus Bonsai. This new book is written for the everyday bonsai grower who wishes help in growing, styling and making the best fig bonsai possible from a tree or two and also contains information about figs suitable for the advanced bonsai grower and artist. The book is highly enhanced from the first book as it now contains over 40 Ficus species references that will greatly help the bonsai enthusiast to identify and to grow these specimens. Also included are photos of many Ficus species to aid in identifying the often confusing world of Ficus. There is also a list of Ficus that likely will prove difficult to grow as bonsai. Jerry has held many offices in the bonsai world. He has been president and vice-president of the Big Sky Bonsai Society; chairman of the publications committee of the American Bonsai Society; a member of the board of the National Bonsai Foundation; and is an honorary member of the Ann Arbor Bonsai Society of Michigan. Jerry has had two of his masterpiece bonsai accepted into the Matthaei Botanical Gardens Bonsai collection of the University of Michigan and into the Denver Botanic Garden Bonsai collection.

Ironically, this does such a good job aerating that gardeners spend the rest of the season pulling weeds and replacing the suddenly energized (and easily used up) nutrients. Mother nature, on the other hand, gardens from the top down-layering undisturbed soil with leaves and other organic materials. In following this example and synthesizing the work of other perceptive gardeners, Lee Reich presents a compelling new system called weedless gardening. The Weedless Garden is good for plants and it's good for people. It protects the soil, contributes to plant health, reduces water needs, cuts down on a gardener's labor, encourages earthworms and, of course, mitigates weed problems by keeping the seeds dormant. Four basic tenets form the system's backbone-minimize soil disruption; protect soil surface; avoid soil compaction; use drip irrigation-and the way to get there is simple. For a new bed or established garden, layering is key, and the perfect material to use is also among the most common-newspaper. Add organic mulch and compost on top, and plants are growing in rich, self-generating humus. From vegetable gardening to flower gardens to planting trees, shrubs, and vines, The Weedless Garden works everywhere-allowing the gardener to work quite a bit less.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780761172024"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0761172025"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "3.6.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 900.28, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 450.14, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3MXMCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 900280000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 450140000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Weedless_Gardening-sample-epub.acsm?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Weedless_Gardening-sample-pdf.acsm?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VT6r46c89mkC", "etag": "rHNZWJfQtow", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VT6r46c89mkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Gardening Indoors", "subtitle": "The Indoor Gardener's Bible", "authors": ["George F.

It\u2019s a front-and-center topic in everything from politics to art, from science to economics. We know now that leaving food to government and industry specialists was one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest mistakes. The question is where do we go from here. Author Andy Brennan describes uncultivation as a process: It involves exploring the wild; recognizing that much of nature is omitted from our conventional ways of seeing and doing things (our cultivations); and realizing the advantages to embracing what we\u2019ve somehow forgotten or ignored. For most of us this process can be difficult, like swimming against the strong current of our modern culture. The hero of this book is the wild apple. Uncultivated follows Brennan\u2019s twenty-four-year history with naturalized trees and shows how they have guided him toward successes in agriculture, in the art of cider making, and in creating a small-farm business. The book contains useful information relevant to those particular fields, but is designed to connect the wild to a far greater audience, skillfully blending cultural criticism with a food activist\u2019s agenda. Apples rank among the most manipulated crops in the world, because not only do farmers want perfect fruit, they also assume the health of the tree depends on human intervention. Yet wild trees live all around us, and left to their own devices, they achieve different forms of success that modernity fails to apprehend. Andy Brennan learned of the health and taste advantages of such trees, and by emulating nature in his orchard (and in his cider) he has also enjoyed environmental and financial benefits. None of this would be possible by following today\u2019s prevailing winds of apple cultivation. In all fields, our cultural perspective is limited by a parallel proclivity. It\u2019s not just agriculture: we all must fight tendencies toward specialization, efficiency, linear thought, and predetermined growth. We have cultivated those tendencies at the exclusion of nature\u2019s full range. If Uncultivated is about faith in nature, and the power it has to deliver us from our own mistakes, then wild apple trees have already shown us the way.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603588454"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603588450"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Cooking"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1862.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1862.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-98CbDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1862160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1862160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Uncultivated-sample-epub.acsm?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QHgMqnqaW_YC", "etag": "IfN6HjU46WQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QHgMqnqaW_YC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Invasive Species and Biodiversity Management", "authors": ["Odd Terje Sandlund", "Peter Johan Schei", "\u00c5slaug Viken"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2001-06-30", "description": "The invasive species problem will become increasingly important in the years to come.

Addressing one of the most repressed subjects in landscape architecture, this book could only have been written by someone who is both an experienced gardener and a landscape architect. With Overgrown, Julian Raxworthy offers a watershed work in the tradition of Ian McHarg, Anne Whiston Spirn, Kevin Lynch, and J. B. Jackson. As a discipline, landscape architecture has distanced itself from gardening, and landscape architects take pains to distinguish themselves from gardeners or landscapers. Landscape architects tend to imagine gardens from the office, representing plants with drawings or other simulations, whereas gardeners work in the dirt, in real time, planting, pruning, and maintaining. In Overgrown, Raxworthy calls for the integration of landscape architecture and gardening. Each has something to offer the other: Landscape architecture can design beautiful spaces, and gardening can enhance and deepen the beauty of garden environments over time. Growth, says Raxworthy, is the medium of garden development; landscape architects should leave the office and go into the garden in order to know growth in an organic, nonsimulated way. Raxworthy proposes a new practice for working with plant material that he terms \u201cthe viridic\u201d (after \u201cthe tectonic\u201d in architecture), from the Latin word for green, with its associations of spring and growth.

Celebrated farming expert Eliot Coleman helped start this movement with The New Organic Grower published 20 years ago. He continues to lead the way, pushing the limits of the harvest season while working his world-renowned organic farm in Harborside, Maine. Now, with his long-awaited new book, The Winter Harvest Handbook, anyone can have access to his hard-won experience. Gardeners and farmers can use the innovative, highly successful methods Coleman describes in this comprehensive handbook to raise crops throughout the coldest of winters. Building on the techniques that hundreds of thousands of farmers and gardeners adopted from The New Organic Grower and Four-Season Harvest, this new book focuses on growing produce of unparalleled freshness and quality in customized unheated or, in some cases, minimally heated, movable plastic greenhouses. Coleman offers clear, concise details on greenhouse construction and maintenance, planting schedules, crop management, harvesting practices, and even marketing methods in this complete, meticulous, and illustrated guide. Readers have access to all the techniques that have proven to produce higher-quality crops on Coleman\u2019s own farm. His painstaking research and experimentation with more than 30 different crops will be valuable to small farmers, homesteaders, and experienced home gardeners who seek to expand their production seasons. A passionate advocate for the revival of small-scale sustainable farming, Coleman provides a practical model for supplying fresh, locally grown produce during the winter season, even in climates where conventional wisdom says it \u201cjust can\u2019t be done.\u201d", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603582100"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "160358210X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 264, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aAn2XI29yToC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aAn2XI29yToC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aAn2XI29yToC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAn2XI29yToC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAn2XI29yToC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2096.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2096.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAn2XI29yToC&rdid=book-aAn2XI29yToC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2096070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2096070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Winter_Harvest_Handbook-sample-epub.acsm?id=aAn2XI29yToC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Winter_Harvest_Handbook-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aAn2XI29yToC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aAn2XI29yToC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "P2GS1m876L4C", "etag": "soA8ZScCIMI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/P2GS1m876L4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Flower Confidential", "subtitle": "The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful", "authors": ["Amy Stewart"], "publisher": "Algonquin Books", "publishedDate": "2008-03-18", "description": "Award-winning author Amy Stewart takes readers on an around-the-world, behind-the-scenes look at the flower industry and how it has sought\u2014for better or worse\u2014to achieve perfection.

More than just a field guide to wild edibles, it is a global plan for human survival. When Katrina Blair was eleven she had a life-changing experience where wild plants spoke to her, beckoning her to become a champion of their cause. Since then she has spent months on end taking walkabouts in the wild, eating nothing but what she forages, and has become a wild-foods advocate, community activist, gardener, and chef, teaching and presenting internationally about foraging and the healthful lifestyle it promotes. Katrina Blair\u2019s philosophy in The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is sobering, realistic, and ultimately optimistic. If we can open our eyes to see the wisdom found in these weeds right under our noses, instead of trying to eradicate an \u201cinvasive,\u201d we will achieve true food security. The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is about healing ourselves both in body and in spirit, in an age where technology, commodity agriculture, and processed foods dictate the terms of our intelligence. But if we can become familiar with these thirteen edible survival weeds found all over the world, we will never go hungry, and we will become closer to our own wild human instincts\u2014all the while enjoying the freshest, wildest, and most nutritious food there is. For free! The thirteen plants found growing in every region across the world are: dandelion, mallow, purslane, plantain, thistle, amaranth, dock, mustard, grass, chickweed, clover, lambsquarter, and knotweed. These special plants contribute to the regeneration of the earth while supporting the survival of our human species; they grow everywhere where human civilization exists, from the hottest deserts to the Arctic Circle, following the path of human disturbance. Indeed, the more humans disturb the earth and put our food supply at risk, the more these thirteen plants proliferate. It\u2019s a survival plan for the ages. Including over one hundred unique recipes, Katrina Blair\u2019s book teaches us how to prepare these wild plants from root to seed in soups, salads, slaws, crackers, pestos, seed breads, and seed butters; cereals, green powders, sauerkrauts, smoothies, and milks; first-aid concoctions such as tinctures, teas, salves, and soothers; self-care/beauty products including shampoo, mouthwash, toothpaste (and brush), face masks; and a lot more. Whether readers are based at home or traveling, this book aims to empower individuals to maintain a state of optimal health with minimal cost and effort.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603585170"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603585176"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1712.81, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1712.81, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1712810000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1712810000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Wild_Wisdom_of_Weeds-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Wild_Wisdom_of_Weeds-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZD_PBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]}
