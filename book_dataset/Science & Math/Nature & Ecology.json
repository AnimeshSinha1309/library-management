Leading experts report on the potentials and limitations concerning the use of computer systems in risk management. Their reports are based on many years of experience in their fields which include: risk analysis, systems engineering, geographic information systems, decision support systems, human--machine systems, and psychology. The book addresses four major issues in computer supported risk management: Conceptual aspects: the role, design, and use of computers in risk management Planning and policy analysis: transportation, equity analysis, emergency management, group decision making Operational decision making: nuclear power monitoring, emergency response, public safety warning, satellite tracking Commercial applications: GIS from IIASA, InterClair from IAEA, EPA software, cleanup decision support software survey. This book is meant for researchers, who will find the emerging issues in risk management that are motivated by the encounter of new tasks and novel technology; practitioners who will have descriptions and references of the state-of-the-art models and software; and students who will learn the basic concepts needed to develop advanced information and decision support systems in risk management.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401102452"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401102457"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 373, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computer_Supported_Risk_Management-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Fy_7CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "pWpMEzIUl2IC", "etag": "N8H1DOFUumk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/pWpMEzIUl2IC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Evolutionary Perspectives on Environmental Problems", "authors": ["Dustin J. Penn", "Iver Mysterud"], "publisher": "Transaction Publishers", "description": "The twenty-first century presents an increasing number of environmental problems, including toxic pollution, global warming, destruction of tropical forests, extinction of biological diversity, and depletion of natural resources. These environmental problems are generally due to human behavior, namely over-consumption of resources and overpopulation. Designing effective policies to address these problems requires a deep understanding of human behavior as well as ecology. This in turn requires considerations of human nature, and the evolutionary \"design\" of the human mind. Evolutionary research on human behavior has profound implications for the environmental sciences. The aim of this collection is to bring together a variety of chapters that show how and why. Part 1, \"Human Nature and Resource Conservation,\" addresses environmental problems from different evolutionary perspectives. Part 2, \"The Ecological Noble Savage Hypothesis,\" examines the notion that our environmental problems are due to Western culture, and that our ancestors and people in indigenous societies lived in harmony with nature until the corrupting influences of Western culture. Part 3, \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" explores the conservation of common-pool or open-access natural resources, such as fisheries, forests, grazing lands, freshwater, and clean air. Part 4, \"The Evolution of Discounting and Conspicuous Consumption,\" looks at the problem of explaining why people are so ecologically short-sighted and why people in developed countries consume so many resources. Part 5, \"Overpopulation and Fertility Declines,\" addresses the evolution of human reproductive decisions. Part 6, \"Biophilia,\" aims to explain why people cherish nature as well as destroy it. The goal of this volume is to introduce environmental thinkers to evolutionary perspectives on human behavior, and the new interdisciplinary sciences of evolutionary psychology and behavioral ecology. This reader aims to help bridge the artificial division between the biological and social sciences, and provide a synthesis between evolutionary sciences of human behavior and environmental sciences.

Dr Harsh Varma, Director, Development Assistance Department, World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) For those interested in how tourism can assist in the economic and social development of societies in need, Responsible Tourism effectively integrates scales and types of knowledge to present an informative, stimulating perspective. It will be on my bookshelf. Steve McCool, Professor Emeritus, Wildland Recreation Management, University of Montana Responsible tourism is one of the most significant contemporary issues for tourism scholars and practitioners alike. This useful and clearly written collection of new research demonstrates the innovations in responsible tourism occurring within southern Africa and provides lessons for international research and practice. Professor Christian Rogerson, University of Witwatersrand, South Africa Conservation efforts are often seen to be in conflict with local livelihoods and resource use - the park versus people debate. Responsible tourism and Ecotourism are often invoked as a third way that serve both ends. Yet do they actually work in practice? This volume delves deep into practice in southern Africa, the hotbed of innovation on the issue, and provides a comprehensive, evidence-based examination of what works and what fails, using a wealth of information from scholars and practitioners working in the region. This book opens with an overview of the issues, looks at what sustainable and responsible tourism are in practice and how they may contribute to conservation, poverty alleviation and local economic development. Part 1 examines policies and institutional activities in responsible tourism by governments, donor agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and addresses the market for responsible travel. Part 2 considers responsible nature-based tourism, the economics of wildlife tourism and ecotourism, transfrontier conservation areas, ecological impacts of tourism and other issues. Part 3 looks at more detailed case studies of community-based tourism projects, and highlights the reasons for successes and failures in this sector. The book concludes with a synthesis of the key findings with implications for policy, destination planning, business management, and future private sector and donor interventions.

From Native Americans and early explorers to land speculators and conservationists, people have long been drawn to this rugged region. Timothy Silver explores the long and complicated history of the Black Mountains, drawing on both the historical record and his experience as a backpacker and fly fisherman. He chronicles the geological and environmental forces that created this intriguing landscape, then traces its history of environmental change and human intervention from the days of Indian-European contact to today. Among the many tales Silver recounts is that of Elisha Mitchell, the renowned geologist and University of North Carolina professor for whom Mount Mitchell is named, who fell to his death there in 1857. But nature's stories--of forest fires, chestnut blight, competition among plants and animals, insect invasions, and, most recently, airborne toxins and acid rain--are also part of Silver's narrative, making it the first history of the Appalachians in which the natural world gets equal time with human history. It is only by understanding the dynamic between these two forces, Silver says, that we can begin to protect the Black Mountains for future generations.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780807863145"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0807863149"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.9.5.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_pGKBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_pGKBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_pGKBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_pGKBQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Mount_Mitchell_and_the_Black_Mountains.html?hl=&id=_pGKBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Mount_Mitchell_and_the_Black_Mountains-sample-epub.acsm?id=_pGKBQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_pGKBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "hHmRPYQa_bQC", "etag": "C0laeHIuxzM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hHmRPYQa_bQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Pearls and Pebbles", "authors": ["Catharine Parr Traill"], "publisher": "Dundurn", "publishedDate": "1999-11-15", "description": "How fitting to close out the 20th century with a brand new edition of Pearls & Pebbles by the noted chronicler of pioneer life, Catharine Parr Traill.

For twenty years she fought for her rights in Western Canada. Heading for Home gives a very warm account of her companions throughout those years from cowhands to lovable animals; from concerned neighbours to the formality of the company man, some of whom too, eventually became firm friends. Aided at times in her struggle by her friend the author and tracker Andy Russell, Heading for Home tells the tale of how one woman\u2019s strength and willpower contributed to our heightened sense of mutual awareness. In the course of her long struggle to save everything she held most dear, Zahava Hanan stood squarely up to a \"David and Goliath\" confrontation with the corporations. During that time, however, she came to understand that by daring to care for our environment we inherit a common ground, goal and home. This book is also the story of that spiritual quest and challenge. And it is in this sense that Zahava Hanan has been \"heading for home,\" and helping others get there, ever since.

Although the chemicals used are for the large part harmless, there is a significant amount of chemicals in use that can be health hazards during specific exposure circumstances. The Navy Environmental Health Center (NEHC) is primarily tasked with assessing these hazards. The NEHC completes its tasks by reviewing toxicological and related data and preparing health-hazard assessments (HHAs) for the different chemicals. Since the NEHC is continually asked to develop these HHAs, the National Research Council (NRC) was asked to assess independently the validity and effectiveness of NEHC's HHA process, in order to determine whether the process as implemented provides the Navy with the best, comprehensive, and defensible evaluations of health hazards and to identify any elements that might require improvement. The task was assigned to the Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology's Committee on Toxicology's (COT's) Subcommittee on Toxicological hazard and Risk Assessment. Review of the U.S. Navy Environmental Health Center's Health-Hazard Assessment Process presents the subcommittee's report. The report is the work of expertise in general toxicology, inhalation toxicology, epidemiology, neurotoxicology, immunotoxicology, reproductive and developmental toxicology, pharmacology, medicine, risk assessment, and biostatistics. It is based on its review of documents provided by NEHC, presentations by NEHC personnel, and site visits to NEHC in Norfolk, Virginia and an aircraft carrier in San Diego, California.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0309183758"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780309183758"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 94, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.6.7.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mlbiNbISeNQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mlbiNbISeNQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mlbiNbISeNQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mlbiNbISeNQC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mlbiNbISeNQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3346.17, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3346.17, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mlbiNbISeNQC&rdid=book-mlbiNbISeNQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3346170000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3346170000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mlbiNbISeNQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "R4NHzn4HBf4C", "etag": "D21XMZ3TLgU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/R4NHzn4HBf4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Plants of Old Hawaii", "authors": ["Lois Lucas"], "publisher": "Bess Press", "publishedDate": "1982", "description": "An introduction to 20 plants of the Ancient Hawaiians.

Our intended audience is field ecologists in general and, in particular, wildlife and fisheries biologists who are attempting to measure the extent to which real animal populations are selective in their choice of food and habitat. As such, we have made no attempt to address those aspects of theoretical ecology that are concerned with how animals might choose their resources if they acted in an optimal manner. The book is based on the concept of a resource selection function (RSF), where this is a function of characteristics measured on resourceunits such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used. We argue that this concept leads to a unified theory for the analysis and interpretation of data on resource selection and can replace many ad hoc statistical methods that have been used in the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306481512"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306481510"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Resource_Selection_by_Animals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "dLckCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "v6o9lKGzkCY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dLckCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Environmental Governance", "subtitle": "Institutions, Policies and Actions", "authors": ["Arild Vatn"], "publisher": "Edward Elgar Publishing", "publishedDate": "2015-12-18", "description": "In this innovative book, Arild Vatn presents an overview of the field of environmental governance, from its theoretical foundations, to the major issues and practical applications.

Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth\u2019s most fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet\u2019s great mysteries. Now The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before. In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field\u2014naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork\u2014masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and new history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a book for the ages. Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers\u2014themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period\u2014into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, T. rex, Triceratops, Brontosaurus, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs\u2019 peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth\u2019s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a \u201csixth extinction.\u201d Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research\u2014which he calls \u201ca new golden age of discovery\u201d\u2014and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China. An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs\u2019 epic saga, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come. Includes 75 images, world maps of the prehistoric earth, and a dinosaur family tree.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062490452"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062490451"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 14, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.9.8.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1385.56, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 692.78, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aOMtDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1385560000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 692780000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Dinosaurs-sample-epub.acsm?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kDWEITOrHxwC", "etag": "V11dHQZO/xY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kDWEITOrHxwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Understanding Animal Abuse", "subtitle": "A Sociological Analysis", "authors": ["Clifton P.

Since then, however, empirical studies of animal abuse, and its relation to other forms of violence toward humans, have increased not only in number but in quality and stature. Sociologists, criminologists, social workers, psychologists, legal scholars, feminists, and others have recognized the myriad reasons that animal abuse is worthy of serious scholarly focus. In his overview of contemporary sociological understanding of animal abuse, Clifton Flynn asks why studying animal abuse is important, examines the connections between animal abuse and human violence, surveys the theses surrounding the supposed link between abuse of animals and humans, and lays out some theoretical perspectives on the issue. The book offers recommendations for policy and professionals and directions for future research. Ultimately, Understanding Animal Abuseachallenges the reader to consider animal abuse as not limited just to harmful acts committed by individuals. It asks us to extend our notion of abuse to the systemic cruelty of factory farms and vivisection laboratories.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781590563403"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1590563409"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 133, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kDWEITOrHxwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kDWEITOrHxwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kDWEITOrHxwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kDWEITOrHxwC&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_Animal_Abuse.html?hl=&id=kDWEITOrHxwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kDWEITOrHxwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ek4mm94aZIMC", "etag": "L55Lq1UPNSQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ek4mm94aZIMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Shapes", "subtitle": "Nature's patterns: a tapestry in three parts", "authors": ["Philip Ball"], "publisher": "OUP Oxford", "publishedDate": "2009-03-12", "description": "Patterns are everywhere in nature - in the ranks of clouds in the sky, the stripes of an angelfish, the arrangement of petals in flowers. Where does this order and regularity come from? It creates itself. The patterns we see come from self-organization.

Part of a trilogy of books exploring the science of patterns in nature, acclaimed science writer Philip Ball here looks at how shapes form. From soap bubbles to honeycombs, delicate shell patterns, and even the developing body parts of a complex animal like ourselves, he uncovers patterns in growth and form in all corners of the natural world, explains how these patterns are self-made, and why similar shapes and structures may be found in very different settings, orchestrated by nothing more than simple physical forces.

Accor dingly, until fairly recently it was a medical act with a limited scientific basis which was practised more or less clandestinely. The development of semen preservation has totally changed the conditions of artificial insemination, especially in regard to flexibility and safeguards in its application. Although the use of fresh semen continues, it is now clear that the future of arti ficial insemination is closely linked to semen preservation. During the past two decades, semen banks have been developed in many countries. This has most often been the result of the initiative of individual physicians in either the private or public sectors. In France, a national system of semen banks (CECOS) was begun in 1973. Although there has been cooperation within this system in the areas of both research and management, a need to com municate and compare experiences with those from other countries was perceived. Thus, the first International Symposium on Artifi cial Insemination and Semen Preservation was planned and held in Paris, France in April 1979. Thirty-seven countries were represented byihdividuals from many concerned disciplines.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468488241"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468488244"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 640, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8826.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8826.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-OqPVBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8826400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8826400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Human_Artificial_Insemination_and_Semen-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OqPVBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VV6BCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "JRr6Mc+S3As", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VV6BCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Biology of Terrestrial Molluscs", "authors": ["G.

human-environment systems (CHES) and integrates ideas from the social sciences of climate change into a study of rural development amid flooding and urbanization in the Poyang Lake Region (PLR) of China. Author Qing Tian operationalizes the concept of sustainability and provides useful scientific analyses for sustainable development in less developed rural areas that are vulnerable to climatic hazards. The book uses a new sustainability framework that is centered on the concept of well-being to study rural development in PLR. The PLR study includes three major analyses: (1) a regional assessment of human well-being; (2) an empirical analysis of rural livelihoods; and (3) an agent-based computer model used to explore future rural development. These analyses provide a meaningful view of human development in the Poyang Lake Region and illustrate some of the complex local- and macro-level processes that shape the livelihoods of rural households in the dynamic process of urbanization. They generate useful insights about how government policy might effectively improve the well-being of rural households and promote sustainable development amid social, economic, and environmental changes. This case study has broader implications. Rural populations in the developing world are disproportionally affected by extreme climate events and climate change. Furthermore, the livelihoods of rural households in the developing world are increasingly under the influences of macro-level forces amid urbanization and globalization. This case study demonstrates that rural development policies must consider broader development dynamics at the national (and even global) level, as well as specific local social and environmental contexts. By treating climate as one of many factors that affect development in such places, we can provide policy recommendations that synergistically promote development and reduce climatic impacts and therefore facilitate mainstreaming climate adaptation into development.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319526850"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319526855"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 236, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-pNQkDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rural_Sustainability-sample-epub.acsm?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rural_Sustainability-sample-pdf.acsm?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pNQkDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tDszAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "SlZ4AdRGmk8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tDszAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ask the Beasts: Darwin and the God of Love", "authors": ["Elizabeth A.

Solar energy, once a niche application for a limited market, has become the cheapest and fastest-growing power source on earth. What's more, its potential is nearly limitless\u2014every hour the sun beams down more energy than the world uses in a year. But in Taming the Sun, energy expert Varun Sivaram warns that the world is not yet equipped to harness erratic sunshine to meet most of its energy needs. And if solar's current surge peters out, prospects for replacing fossil fuels and averting catastrophic climate change will dim. Innovation can brighten those prospects, Sivaram explains, drawing on firsthand experience and original research spanning science, business, and government. Financial innovation is already enticing deep-pocketed investors to fund solar projects around the world, from the sunniest deserts to the poorest villages. Technological innovation could replace today's solar panels with coatings as cheap as paint and employ artificial photosynthesis to store intermittent sunshine as convenient fuels. And systemic innovation could add flexibility to the world's power grids and other energy systems so they can dependably channel the sun's unreliable energy. Unleashing all this innovation will require visionary public policy: funding researchers developing next-generation solar technologies, refashioning energy systems and economic markets, and putting together a diverse clean energy portfolio. Although solar can't power the planet by itself, it can be the centerpiece of a global clean energy revolution.

Now, he brings his powers of observation to the biological networks that surround all species, including humans. Haskell repeatedly visits a dozen trees, exploring connections with people, microbes, fungi, and other plants and animals. He takes us to trees in cities (from Manhattan to Jerusalem), forests (Amazonian, North American, and boreal) and areas on the front lines of environmental change (eroding coastlines, burned mountainsides, and war zones.) In each place he shows how human history, ecology, and well-being are intimately intertwined with the lives of trees. Scientific, lyrical, and contemplative, Haskell reveals the biological connections that underpin all life.

Many women writers of this period used the natural world as a platform for discussing issues of domesticity, education, and the nation. To what extent, asks Gianquitto, did these writers challenge the prevalent sentimental narrative modes (like those used in the popular flower language books) and use scientific terminology to describe the world around them? The book maps the intersections of the main historical and narrative trajectories that inform the answer to this question: the changing literary representations of the natural world in texts produced by women from the 1820s to the 1880s and the developments in science from the Enlightenment to the advent of evolutionary biology. Though Gianquitto considers a range of women's nature writing (botanical manuals, plant catalogs, travel narratives, seasonal journals, scientific essays), she focuses on four writers and their most influential works: Almira Phelps (Familiar Lectures on Botany, 1829), Margaret Fuller (Summer on the Lakes, in 1843), Susan Fenimore Cooper (Rural Hours, 1850), and Mary Treat (Home Studies in Nature, 1885). From these writings emerges a set of common concerns about the interaction of reason and emotion in the study of nature, the best vocabularies for representing objects in nature (local, scientific, or moral), and the competing systems for ordering the natural world (theological, taxonomic, or aesthetic). This is an illuminating study about the culturally assumed relationship between women, morality, and science.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0820329185"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780820329185"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x7XxSSu3ccUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x7XxSSu3ccUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=x7XxSSu3ccUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=x7XxSSu3ccUC&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Good_Observers_of_Nature.html?hl=&id=x7XxSSu3ccUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Good_Observers_of_Nature-sample-epub.acsm?id=x7XxSSu3ccUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Good_Observers_of_Nature-sample-pdf.acsm?id=x7XxSSu3ccUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=x7XxSSu3ccUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "pF1nDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "CMuOxF+YN5s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/pF1nDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Bahan Galian Industri", "authors": ["Sukandarrumidi"], "publisher": "UGM PRESS", "publishedDate": "2018-08-06", "description": "Buku ini memberikan konfirmasi tentang jumlah bahan galian industri yang terdapat di Indonesia.

Each entry includes vivid color photographs for each stone to aid identification and to showcase its beauty, as well as listing its scientific information, its element and chakra correspondences, and the physical, emotional, and spiritual benefits of each stone. Illustrated by gorgeously lit, clear color photos to aid quick identification, the book offers an illuminating alphabetical journey through the mineral kingdom, stone by stone. This new edition of The Book of Stones, the best-selling guide to some of Earth's most beautiful natural objects, is revised to include 76 new entries. The book begins with two introductory chapters detailing advice by authors Naisha Ahsian and Robert Simmons on how to work with crystals and stones--including the concept of crystal resonance and the scientific observation that living organisms (such as ourselves) are liquid crystalline structures. Each entry begins with the stone name and photo, plus its elemental and chakra correspondences, as well as keywords that indicate its properties. Next comes a description of the crystal structure, hardness, history, and known locations of each mineral, plus any relevant legend or lore from the past. Each author then offers their own take and personal insights on the subtle energy properties and spiritual applications of the stone. The entries conclude with summaries of the spiritual, emotional, and physical healing qualities of the stone, and an affirmation for evoking its potential benefits. The book's presentation is straightforward enough to make it an excellent introduction for beginners, yet the level of detail and the depth of research make it an invaluable resource for the most experienced stone practitioners.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781583949092"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1583949097"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 560, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Body, Mind & Spirit"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2639.37, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2639.37, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jtFnBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2639370000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2639370000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Book_of_Stones_Revised_Edition-sample-epub.acsm?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jtFnBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lKv8Su0rThIC", "etag": "VS8UZJqRebY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lKv8Su0rThIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Animal Rights", "subtitle": "Current Debates and New Directions", "authors": ["Cass R.

Travellers often become enchanted with the first country that captures their hearts and gives them license to be free. For Wade Davis, it was Colombia. In this masterful new book, he revisits the mighty Magdalena, the river that made possible the nation. Along the way, he finds a people who have overcome years of conflict precisely because of their character, informed by an enduring spirit of place, and a deep love of a land that is home to the greatest ecological and geographical diversity on the planet. Only in Colombia can a traveller wash ashore in a coastal desert, follow waterways through wetlands as wide as the sky, ascend narrow tracks through dense tropical forests, and reach verdant Andean valleys rising to soaring ice-clad summits. Both a corridor of commerce and a fountain of culture, the wellspring of Colombian music, literature, poetry and prayer, the Magdalena has served in dark times as the graveyard of the nation. And yet, always, it returns as a river of life. At once an absorbing adventure and an inspiring tale of hope and redemption, Magdalena gives us a rare, kaleidoscopic picture of a nation on the verge of a new period of peace. Braiding together memoir, history, and journalism, Wade Davis tells the story of the country's most magnificent river, and in doing so, tells the epic story of Colombia.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781473573161"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1473573165"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Travel"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U22jDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U22jDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=U22jDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=U22jDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Magdalena.html?hl=&id=U22jDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=U22jDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "UuVDBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "s44CirNfl2k", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/UuVDBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Not Forgetting The Whale", "subtitle": "'Will restore your faith in humanity' Elle", "authors": ["John Ironmonger"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2015-02-12", "description": "THE STORY OF A MAN WHO HAD GIVEN UP HOPE... ...AND THE VILLAGE THAT GAVE IT BACK TO HIM 'Will restore your faith in humanity' Elle UK 'A gentle and uplifting tale set in a remote corner of Cornwall' Financial Times 'As the front pages crowd with headlines that grow ever more grim, Not Forgetting the Whale offers a very welcome alternative' Independent When a young City trader, Joe, washes up on the sands of St Piran in Cornwall, warning of a global financial apocalypse, he is rescued by the villagers, and given a home.

In 1943, one of the first to recognize this fact, the great botanist Nikolay Vavilov, lay dying of starvation in a Soviet prison. But in the years before Stalin jailed him as a scapegoat for the country\u2019s famines, Vavilov had traveled over five continents, collecting hundreds of thousands of seeds in an effort to outline the ancient centers of agricultural diversity and guard against widespread hunger. Now, another remarkable scientist\u2014and vivid storyteller\u2014has retraced his footsteps. In Where Our Food Comes From, Gary Paul Nabhan weaves together Vavilov\u2019s extraordinary story with his own expeditions to Earth\u2019s richest agricultural landscapes and the cultures that tend them. Retracing Vavilov\u2019s path from Mexico and the Colombian Amazon to the glaciers of the Pamirs in Tajikistan, he draws a vibrant portrait of changes that have occurred since Vavilov\u2019s time and why they matter. In his travels, Nabhan shows how climate change, free trade policies, genetic engineering, and loss of traditional knowledge are threatening our food supply. Through discussions with local farmers, visits to local outdoor markets, and comparison of his own observations in eleven countries to those recorded in Vavilov\u2019s journals and photos, Nabhan reveals just how much diversity has already been lost. But he also shows what resilient farmers and scientists in many regions are doing to save the remaining living riches of our world. It is a cruel irony that Vavilov, a man who spent his life working to foster nutrition, ultimately died from lack of it. In telling his story, Where Our Food Comes From brings to life the intricate relationships among culture, politics, the land, and the future of the world\u2019s food.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781597265171"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1597265179"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2380.27, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2380.27, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&rdid=book-9RBtSrK5k6AC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2380270000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2380270000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Where_Our_Food_Comes_From-sample-epub.acsm?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Where_Our_Food_Comes_From-sample-pdf.acsm?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9RBtSrK5k6AC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0rpxXUUZl5kC", "etag": "Td/+JbVA+80", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0rpxXUUZl5kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Global Casino", "subtitle": "An Introduction to Environmental Issues", "authors": ["Nick Middleton"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18", "description": "The Global Casino is an introduction to environmental issues which deals both with the workings of the physical environment and the political, economic and social frameworks in which the issues occur.

It is a book about the human impact on the environment and the ways in which the natural environment impacts human society. The fifth edition has been fully revised and updated throughout, with new case studies, figures, and online resources such as downloadable figures and tables from the text and multiple choice questions for students, accessible at: www.routledge.com/cw/middleton. New topics covered in extended boxed case studies include payment for environmental services, ocean acidification, biofuels in Brazil, waste reduction through industrial symbiosis, and the long-term impact of natural disasters on vulnerable groups. Other approaches and concepts covered for the first time in this new edition include traditional ecological knowledge, environmental justice, the \u2018resource curse\u2019, and urban biodiversity. Eighteen chapters on key issues follow three initial chapters which outline the background contexts of the physical and human environments and the concept of sustainable development. Each chapter provides historical context for key issues, outlines why they have arisen, and highlights areas of controversy and uncertainty to appraise how issues can be resolved both technically and in political and economic frameworks. Each chapter also contains an updated critical guide to further reading and websites, as well as discussion points and essay questions. The text can be read in its entirety or individual chapters adopted as standalone reading.

One slip, one false move, one missed toehold and you're dead. On June 3rd 2017 Mark Synnott was in Yosemite to witness something that only a handful of people knew was about to occur: the most famous climber in the world, Alex Honnold, was going to attempt to summit one of the world's most challenging ascents, a route called Freerider on the notorious rock formation El Capitan. It is a climb extraordinarily dangerous and difficult, and yet Honnold was going to do it 'free solo'. Meaning no help. No climbing partner. No equipment. No rope. Where a single small mistake would mean certain death. Indeed, to summit El Cap free solo was a feat likened to Neil Armstrong first walking on the moon. In The Impossible Climb, Mark Synnott uses his own career as a professional climber to paint an insider portrait of the elite climbing community, exploring what motivates them, the paradoxical drive to keep the sport pure and at the same time to fund climbs, and the role that awareness of mortality plays in the endeavour. We watch through Mark's eyes as Alex plots, trains and attempts his heart-stopping free-solo ascent. Ultimately this is a story not only about climbing but about what makes us human, how we respond to fear and our drive to transcend the inevitability of death.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781760639877"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1760639877"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.8.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 314.37, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 220.06, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-wp1cDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 314370000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 220060000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Impossible_Climb-sample-epub.acsm?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Impossible_Climb-sample-pdf.acsm?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wp1cDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "qsxc13PqduUC", "etag": "1LiC5EmE+eg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qsxc13PqduUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Green Bible", "authors": ["Stephen B.

The development of domestic sources of alternative transportation fuels with lower greenhouse emissions is now a national imperative. Coal and biomass are in abundant supply in the United States and can be converted to liquid fuels that can be combusted in existing and future vehicles. Their abundant supply makes them attractive candidates to provide non-oil-based liquid fuels to the U.S. transportation system. However, there are important questions about the economic viability, carbon impact, and technology status of these options. Liquid Transportation Fuels from Coal and Biomass provides a snapshot of the potential costs of liquid fuels from biomass by biochemical conversion and from biomass and coal by thermochemical conversion. Policy makers, investors, leaders in industry, the transportation sector, and others with a concern for the environment, economy, and energy security will look to this book as a roadmap to independence from foreign oil.

Evolution happens slowly, with species crafted by natural selection across millennia. Then, a few hundred thousand years ago, along came a bolshie, big-brained, bipedal primate we now call 'Homo sapiens', and with that the Earth's natural history came to an abrupt end. We are now living through the post-natural phase, where the fate of all living things is irrevocably intertwined with our own. We domesticated animals to suit our needs, and altered their DNA \u2013 wolves became dogs to help us hunt and junglefowl became chickens to provide us with eggs. As our knowledge grew we found new ways to tailor the DNA of animals more precisely; we've now cloned police dogs and created a little glow-in-the-dark fish \u2013 the world's first genetically modified pet. The breakthroughs continue. Through climate change, humans have now affected even the most remote environments and their inhabitants, and studies suggest that through our actions we are forcing some animals to evolve at breakneck speed to survive. Whilst some are thriving, others are on the brink of extinction, and for others the only option is life in captivity. Today, it's not just the fittest that survive; sometimes it's the ones we decide to let live. In this entertaining and thought-provoking book, Helen Pilcher considers the many ways that we've shaped the DNA of the animal kingdom and in so doing, altered the fate of life on earth. In her post-natural history guide, she invites us to meet key species that have been sculpted by humanity, as well as the researchers and conservationists who create, manage and tend to these post-natural creations.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472956736"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472956737"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=59&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 385, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 269.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NubIDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 385000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 269500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Life_Changing-sample-epub.acsm?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Life_Changing-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NubIDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_pIcG_aZGjsC", "etag": "7dIE64VToKU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_pIcG_aZGjsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecology of Java & Bali", "authors": ["Anthony J.

Rooted in redemptive correction, this book calls for true partnership through the co-creation of new theological systems that foster wholeness and peace.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780802866783"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0802866786"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 177, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cB5qKv72Jz0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cB5qKv72Jz0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cB5qKv72Jz0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cB5qKv72Jz0C&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Shalom_and_the_Community_of_Creation.html?hl=&id=cB5qKv72Jz0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Shalom_and_the_Community_of_Creation-sample-pdf.acsm?id=cB5qKv72Jz0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cB5qKv72Jz0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "3KVc2AVftI4C", "etag": "FfTuCJ+aQdk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/3KVc2AVftI4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Happy City", "subtitle": "Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design", "authors": ["Charles Montgomery"], "publisher": "Penguin UK", "publishedDate": "2013-11-07", "description": "Happy City is the story of how the solutions to this century's problems - from climate change to overpopulation - lie in unlocking the secrets to great city living This is going to be the century of the city. But what actually makes a good city? Why, really, are some cities a joy to live in? As writer and journalist Charles Montgomery reveals, it's not how much money your neighbours earn, or how spectacular the views from your windows are, or even how pleasant the climate is that makes the most difference. Journeying to dozens of cities - from Atlanta to Bogot\u00e1 to Vancouver - he talks to the new champions of the happy city to discover the progressive movements already transforming people's lives. He meets the visionary Colombian mayor who turned some of the world's most dangerous roads into an urban cycling haven; the Danish architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan towns to modern-day Copenhagen; the New York City transport commissioner who made out of the gridlock of Times Square a place where people could lounge in the sun; and the Californian mother with the super-commute who completely rethought her idea of the suburban dream for the sake of her son's health. These urban trailblazers, as well as the many other planners, engineers, grass-roots campaigners and ordinary citizens, offer a wealth of surprising lessons for the rest of us. From how saying hello to your neighbours is just as important to your sense of trust as contact with close friends and family, and how living close to parks makes us smarter, kinder and reduces local crime rates, to the importance of the 'magic triangle' rule, Happy City shows thatsimple changes can make all the difference. Charles Montgomery is a journalist and urban experimentalist from Vancouver, Canada. His writings on urban planning, psychology, culture, and history have appeared in magazines and journals on three continents. He is the author of two previous books, and is a member of the BMW Guggenheim Lab team.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780141957159"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0141957158"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3KVc2AVftI4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3KVc2AVftI4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3KVc2AVftI4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3KVc2AVftI4C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3KVc2AVftI4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 600.62, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 300.31, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3KVc2AVftI4C&rdid=book-3KVc2AVftI4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 600620000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 300310000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Happy_City-sample-epub.acsm?id=3KVc2AVftI4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3KVc2AVftI4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "BaMBgoKPmjAC", "etag": "jAUnDhDOM6I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BaMBgoKPmjAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "NightWatch", "subtitle": "A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe", "authors": ["Terence Dickinson"], "publisher": "Firefly Books", "publishedDate": "1998", "description": "Offers advice on observing the stars and constellations, discusses useful equipment, and includes information on the moon, comets, eclipses, and planets", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781552093023"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1552093026"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 8, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BaMBgoKPmjAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BaMBgoKPmjAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BaMBgoKPmjAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BaMBgoKPmjAC&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/NightWatch.html?hl=&id=BaMBgoKPmjAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BaMBgoKPmjAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "x75kYjINSqUC", "etag": "ti5koIoZBDA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/x75kYjINSqUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "East African Mammals", "subtitle": "An Atlas of Evolution in Africa", "authors": ["Jonathan Kingdon"], "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "publishedDate": "1984", "description": "Detailed anatomical illustrations accompany information on the appearance, habits, geographical distribution, and evolutionary changes of the smaller mammals of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.

The world's population is exploding, wild species are vanishing, our environment is degrading, and the costs of resources from oil to water are going nowhere but up. So what kind of world are we leaving for our children and grandchildren? Geoscientist and Guggenheim fellow Laurence Smith draws on the latest global modeling research to construct a sweeping thought experiment on what our world will be like in 2050. The result is both good news and bad: Eight nations of the Arctic Rim (including the United States) will become increasingly prosperous, powerful, and politically stable, while those closer to the equator will face water shortages, aging populations, and crowded megacities sapped by the rising costs of energy and coastal flooding. The World in 2050 combines the lessons of geography and history with state-of-the-art model projections and analytical data-everything from climate dynamics and resource stocks to age distributions and economic growth projections. But Smith offers more than a compendium of statistics and studies- he spent fifteen months traveling the Arctic Rim, collecting stories and insights that resonate throughout the book. It is an approach much like Jared Diamond took in Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse, a work of geoscientific investigation rich in the appreciation of human diversity. Packed with stunning photographs, original maps, and informative tables, this is the most authoritative, balanced, and compelling account available of the world of challenges and opportunities that we will leave for our children.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781101443521"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1101443529"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OCL3UNxCY68C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OCL3UNxCY68C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OCL3UNxCY68C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OCL3UNxCY68C&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_World_in_2050.html?hl=&id=OCL3UNxCY68C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_World_in_2050-sample-epub.acsm?id=OCL3UNxCY68C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OCL3UNxCY68C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LsHSBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "axACCRusfyA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LsHSBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Aphids as Virus Vectors", "authors": ["Kerry F. Harris", "Karl Maramorosch"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10", "description": "Aphids as Virus Vectors focuses on aphids as vectors of plant viruses and the fundamentals of their relationship with virus and host. The mouthparts and feeding mechanism of aphids are discussed, along with aphid penetration of plant tissues and the transmission mechanisms of aphids as virus vectors. The intrinsic properties and taxonomy of aphid-borne viruses are also examined. Comprised of 22 chapters, this book begins with an overview of the importance of aphids as vectors, their biology, and the properties of the viruses they transmit. These introductory chapters prepare the reader for later ones on aphid-virus-plant interactions. The next section deals with transmission mechanisms, with emphasis on several novel alternatives to many of the traditionally held concepts of how aphids transmit viruses. Accessory factors in non-persistent virus transmission are considered. Subsequent chapters focus on technological advances in aphid-virus research, including the use of aphid cell culturing, radioisotope methodology, membrane feeding, and electrical measurement systems. The most promising frontiers in epidemiological and control-oriented research are discussed in the last two sections.

Exposing the work of ideologues on the right who know the challenge this poses to the free market all too well, Naomi Klein also challenges the failing strategies of environmental groups.

This book is a case study in evolutionary diversification of life histories. Although birds have a rather uniform body plan and physiology, they exhibit marked variation in development type, parental care, and rate of growth. Altricial birds are fully dependent on their parents for warmth and nutrition and begin posthatching life in a more or less embryonic condition. At the other extreme, such superprecocial species as the megapodes are independent of all parental care from hatching, and the neonate, able to fly, resembles an adult bird.

Although humans have tried to forecast weather for millennia, mathematical principles were used in meteorology only after the turn of the twentieth century. From the first proposal for using mathematics to predict weather, to the supercomputers that now process meteorological information gathered from satellites and weather stations, Ian Roulstone and John Norbury narrate the groundbreaking evolution of modern forecasting. The authors begin with Vilhelm Bjerknes, a Norwegian physicist and meteorologist who in 1904 came up with a method now known as numerical weather prediction. Although his proposed calculations could not be implemented without computers, his early attempts, along with those of Lewis Fry Richardson, marked a turning point in atmospheric science. Roulstone and Norbury describe the discovery of chaos theory's butterfly effect, in which tiny variations in initial conditions produce large variations in the long-term behavior of a system--dashing the hopes of perfect predictability for weather patterns. They explore how weather forecasters today formulate their ideas through state-of-the-art mathematics, taking into account limitations to predictability. Millions of variables--known, unknown, and approximate--as well as billions of calculations, are involved in every forecast, producing informative and fascinating modern computer simulations of the Earth system. Accessible and timely, Invisible in the Storm explains the crucial role of mathematics in understanding the ever-changing weather.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780691152721"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0691152721"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 325, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Mathematics"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qnMrFEHMrWwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qnMrFEHMrWwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qnMrFEHMrWwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qnMrFEHMrWwC&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Invisible_in_the_Storm.html?hl=&id=qnMrFEHMrWwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qnMrFEHMrWwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "J72FOr6AZOEC", "etag": "jD5/8PbwpGU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/J72FOr6AZOEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Life in Amber", "authors": ["George O. Poinar"], "publisher": "Stanford University Press", "publishedDate": "1992", "description": "\"Amber is a semi-precious gem that is formed over eons by natural forces out of the resin of trees. Human fascination with amber dates back to prehistoric times, when it was probably considered to have magical powers and was used for adornment and trade. Amber amulets and beads dating from 35,000 to 1,800 B.C. have been found, and where they have been found (for example in graves hundreds of miles from their chemically determined origins) has often helped to establish ancient trade routes.\" \"The preservative qualities of plant resins were well known by the ancients. The Egyptians used resins to embalm their dead, and the Greeks used them to preserve their wine. Amber often preserved fossils, frequently in a pristine state, of all kinds of animal and plant organisms that made contact with the sticky substance and became trapped in it. These fossils include such fragile organisms as nematodes and mushrooms that ordinarily are not preserved under normal processes of fossilization, as well as larger organisms like scorpions and lizards, and the fossils are preserved in their full three-dimensional form, complete with minute details of scales, mouth parts, antennae, and hairs. It has even been suggested that viable DNA may persist in some amber-trapped organisms.\" \"This book is a compendium of all that we know about life found in amber. It surveys all life forms, from microbes to vertebrates and plants, that have been reported from amber deposits throughout the world, beginning with the earliest pieces dating from some 300 million years ago. It also describes the formation of amber and the location, geological history, and early exploration of the major world amber deposits, including those still being worked today.\" \"The book also provides practical information on how to determine fake amber containing present-day forms of life. It can serve as a beginning for tracing the geological history of a particular group of animals or plants or even reconstructing ancient paleoenvironments, and because amber fossils are preserved so completely, in a transparent medium, they can be intimately compared with related living species. Finally, the book discusses what amber fossils can tell us about evolution and speciation, cellular preservation, and paleosymbiosis.\" \"The book is illustrated with 37 color photographs, 154 black-and-white photographs and drawings, and 8 maps.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Over the past decade, artist Rachel Sussman has researched, worked with biologists, and traveled the world to photograph continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older. Spanning from Antarctica to Greenland, the Mojave Desert to the Australian Outback, the result is a stunning and unique visual collection of ancient organisms unlike anything that has been created in the arts or sciences before, insightfully and accessibly narrated by Sussman along the way. Her work is both timeless and timely, and spans disciplines, continents, and millennia. It is underscored by an innate environmentalism and driven by Sussman\u2019s relentless curiosity. She begins at \u201cyear zero,\u201d and looks back from there, photographing the past in the present. These ancient individuals live on every continent and range from Greenlandic lichens that grow only one centimeter a century, to unique desert shrubs in Africa and South America, a predatory fungus in Oregon, Caribbean brain coral, to an 80,000-year-old colony of aspen in Utah. Sussman journeyed to Antarctica to photograph 5,500-year-old moss; Australia for stromatolites, primeval organisms tied to the oxygenation of the planet and the beginnings of life on Earth; and to Tasmania to capture a 43,600-year-old self-propagating shrub that\u2019s the last individual of its kind. Her portraits reveal the living history of our planet\u2014and what we stand to lose in the future. These ancient survivors have weathered millennia in some of the world\u2019s most extreme environments, yet climate change and human encroachment have put many of them in danger. Two of her subjects have already met with untimely deaths by human hands. Alongside the photographs, Sussman relays fascinating \u2013 and sometimes harrowing \u2013 tales of her global adventures tracking down her subjects and shares insights from the scientists who research them.

How do individuals develop beliefs and ideologies about the environment? How do we express those beliefs through communication? How are we influenced by the messages of pop culture and social institutions? And how does all this communication become part of the larger social fabric of what we know as \"the environment\"? Communicating Nature explores and explains the multiple levels of everyday communication that come together to form our perceptions of the natural world. Author Julia Corbett considers all levels of communication, from communication at the individual level, to environmental messages transmitted by popular culture, to communication generated by social institutions including political and regulatory agencies, business and corporations, media outlets, and educational organizations. The book offers a fresh and engaging introductory look at a topic of broad interest, and is an important work for students of the environment, activists and environmental professionals interested in understanding the cultural context of human-nature interactions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781597267489"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1597267481"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.6.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3262.13, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3262.13, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC&rdid=book-KgtJE2dqUpsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3262130000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3262130000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Communicating_Nature-sample-epub.acsm?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KgtJE2dqUpsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FcYDv7o9X40C", "etag": "5uZhcwvJ7TU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FcYDv7o9X40C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Swampwalker's Journal", "subtitle": "A Wetlands Year", "authors": ["David M.

For Hargrove, becoming an orca trainer fulfilled a childhood dream. However, as his experience with the whales deepened, Hargrove came to doubt that their needs could ever be met in captivity. When two fellow trainers were killed by orcas in marine parks, Hargrove decided that SeaWorld's wildly popular programs were both detrimental to the whales and ultimately unsafe for trainers. After leaving SeaWorld, Hargrove became one of the stars of the controversial documentary Blackfish. The outcry over the treatment of SeaWorld's orca has now expanded beyond the outlines sketched by the award-winning documentary, with Hargrove contributing his expertise to an advocacy movement that is convincing both federal and state governments to act. In Beneath the Surface, Hargrove paints a compelling portrait of these highly intelligent and social creatures, including his favorite whales Takara and her mother Kasatka, two of the most dominant orcas in SeaWorld. And he includes vibrant descriptions of the lives of orcas in the wild, contrasting their freedom in the ocean with their lives in SeaWorld.

The Wild Journal is a beautifully illustrated guide from leading florist and nature writer Willow Crossley. Guiding you through creative practical projects and therapeutic seasonal reflections, The Wild Journal celebrates the potential of nature to mend, heal and transform our mood. The simple, back-to-basics habits and small seasonal changes in the book can help everyone to counteract the unpredictability and chaos of everyday life. Wherever you live, there are simple mindful actions \u2013 from listening to birdsong instead of rushing on your commute, to collecting natural treasures such as feathers, branches, pebbles or pine cones. Willow shares her creative techniques for bringing nature into your daily routine \u2013 whether it's planting and potting, identifying wild flowers, trying your hand at beautifully simple flower arrangements or making your own essential oils and candles. There is space to record reflections and your favourite seasonal activities, as well as ideas for star-gazing, bird-watching, and so much more.

The overall aim of this book is to present innovative approaches to vulnerability analysis and for enhancing the resilience of African cities against climate change-induced risks. Locally adapted IPCC climate change scenarios, which also consider possible changes in urban population, have been developed. Innovative strategies to land use and spatial planning are proposed that seek synergies between the adaptation to climate change and the need to solve social problems. Furthermore, the book explores the role of governance in successfully coping with climate-induced risks in urban areas. The book is unique in that it combines: a top-down perspective of climate change modeling with a bottom-up perspective of vulnerability assessment; quantitative approaches from engineering sciences and qualitative approaches of the social sciences; a novel multi-risk modeling methodology; and strategic approaches to urban and green infrastructure planning with neighborhood perspectives of adaptation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319039824"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319039822"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 404, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-tfFICAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Urban_Vulnerability_and_Climate_Change_i-sample-epub.acsm?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Urban_Vulnerability_and_Climate_Change_i-sample-pdf.acsm?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tfFICAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y4VvaRDm_FkC", "etag": "gW9+ofKbOQY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y4VvaRDm_FkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Cloud Collector's Handbook", "authors": ["Gavin Pretor-Pinney"], "publisher": "Chronicle Books", "publishedDate": "2011-04-29", "description": "The perfect incentive for keeping your head in the clouds, The Cloud Collector's Handbook is a whimsical guide to the wonders of the sky.

Resilient social-ecological systems have the potential to sustain development by responding to and shaping change in a manner that does not lead to loss of future options. Resilient systems also provide capacity for renewal and innovation in the face of rapid transformation and crisis. The term navigating in the title is meant to capture this dynamic process.

In the US, on the other hand, she found that the playgrounds, which she had expected to find teeming with children, were mostly deserted. In preschool, children were getting drilled to learn academic skills, while their Scandinavian counterparts were climbing trees, catching frogs, and learning how to compost. Worse, she realized that giving her daughters the same freedom to play outside that she had enjoyed as a child in Sweden could quickly lead to a visit by Child Protective Services. The brewing culture clash finally came to a head when McGurk was fined for letting her children play in a local creek, setting off an online firestorm when she expressed her anger and confusion on her blog. The rules and parenting philosophies of her native country and her adopted homeland were worlds apart. Struggling to fit in and to decide what was best for her children, McGurk turned to her own childhood for answers. Could the Scandinavian philosophy of \u201cthere is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes\u201d be the key to better lives for her American children? And how would her children\u2019s relationships with nature change by introducing them to Scandinavian concepts like friluftsliv (\u201copen-air living\u201d) and hygge (the coziness and the simple pleasures of home)? McGurk embarked on a six-month-long journey to Sweden to find out. There\u2019s No Such Thing as Bad Weather is a fascinating personal narrative that highlights the importance of spending time outdoors, and illustrates how the Scandinavian culture could hold the key to raising healthier, resilient, and confident children in America.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781501143625"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "150114362X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=alU3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=alU3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=alU3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=113&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=alU3DwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/There_s_No_Such_Thing_as_Bad_Weather.html?hl=&id=alU3DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=alU3DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WOdrGIP3zksC", "etag": "PXmp0o4yoP8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WOdrGIP3zksC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Plants in Hawaiian Culture", "authors": ["Beatrice H.

Today\u2019s kids have adopted sedentary lifestyles filled with television, video games, and computer screens. But more and more, studies show that children need \u201crough and tumble\u201d outdoor play in order to develop their sensory, motor, and executive functions. Disturbingly, a lack of movement has been shown to lead to a number of health and cognitive difficulties, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emotion regulation and sensory processing issues, and aggressiveness at school recess break. So, how can you ensure your child is fully engaging their body, mind, and all of their senses? Using the same philosophy that lies at the heart of her popular TimberNook program\u2014that nature is the ultimate sensory experience, and that psychological and physical health improves for children when they spend time outside on a regular basis\u2014author Angela Hanscom offers several strategies to help your child thrive, even if you live in an urban environment. Today it is rare to find children rolling down hills, climbing trees, or spinning in circles just for fun. We\u2019ve taken away merry-go-rounds, shortened the length of swings, and done away with teeter-totters to keep children safe. Children have fewer opportunities for unstructured outdoor play than ever before, and recess times at school are shrinking due to demanding educational environments. With this book, you\u2019ll discover little things you can do anytime, anywhere to help your kids achieve the movement they need to be happy and healthy in mind, body, and spirit.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781626253759"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1626253757"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Family & Relationships"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 9, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Nature&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1248.05, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 624.02, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WaK0CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1248050000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 624020000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Balanced_and_Barefoot-sample-epub.acsm?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Balanced_and_Barefoot-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WaK0CwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lMwsYIU0VLwC", "etag": "ju3VXywBiOs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lMwsYIU0VLwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Specious Science", "subtitle": "How Genetics and Evolution Reveal why Medical Research on Animals Harms Humans", "authors": ["C.

To do so, he proposes a dramatic change from the current human-dominated Anthropocene era to one that will be founded, materially, ethically, politically, and spiritually on the revolution in thinking being delivered by contemporary symbiotic science.

W.

Elaine Sciolino came to Paris as a young foreign correspondent and was seduced by a river. In The Seine, she tells the story of that river from its source on a remote plateau of Burgundy to the wide estuary where its waters meet the sea, and the cities, tributaries, islands, ports, and bridges in between. Sciolino explores the Seine through its rich history and lively characters: a bargewoman, a riverbank bookseller, a houseboat dweller, a famous cinematographer known for capturing the river\u2019s light. She discovers the story of Sequana\u2014the Gallo-Roman healing goddess who gave the Seine its name\u2014and follows the river through Paris, where it determined the city\u2019s destiny and now snakes through all aspects of daily life. She patrols with river police, rows with a restorer of antique boats, sips champagne at a vineyard along the river, and even dares to go for a swim. She finds the Seine in art, literature, music, and movies from Renoir and Les Mis\u00e9rables to Puccini and La La Land. Along the way, she reveals how the river that created Paris has touched her own life. A powerful afterword tells the dramatic story of how water from the depths of the Seine saved Notre-Dame from destruction during the devastating fire in April 2019. A \u201cstoryteller at heart\u201d (June Sawyers, Chicago Tribune) with a \u201csumptuous eye for detail\u201d (Sinclair McKay, Daily Telegraph), Sciolino braids memoir, travelogue, and history through the Seine\u2019s winding route.
