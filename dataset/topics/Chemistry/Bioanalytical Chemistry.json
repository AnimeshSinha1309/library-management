Conventional textbooks tend to present chemistry in a way that is not always easily accessible to students, particularly those coming from diverse educational backgrounds, who may not have formally studied chemistry before. This prompted the authors to write this particular textbook, taking a new, fresh and innovative approach to teaching and learning of chemistry, focusing on bioanalysis to set knowledge in context. This textbook is primarily targeted to undergraduate life and health science students, but may be a useful resource for practising scientists in a range of disciplines. In this textbook the authors have covered basic principles, terminology and core technologies, which include key modern experimental techniques and equipment used to analyse important biomolecules in diagnostic, industrial and research settings. Written by two authors with a wealth of experience in teaching, research and academic enterprise, this textbook represents an invaluable tool for students and instructors across the diverse range of biological and health science courses. Key Features: Innovative, stand alone teaching and learning resource to enhance delivery of undergraduate chemistry provision to life and health scientists. Develops student knowledge and understanding of core concepts with reference to relevant, real-life, examples.

Demchenko"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2008-12-21", "description": "Fluorescence sensing is a rapidly developing field of research and technology. Its target is nearly the whole world of natural and synthetic compounds being detected in different media including living bodies. The application area range from control of industrial processes to environment monitoring and clinical diagnostics. Among different detection methods fluorescence techniques are distinguished by ultimate sensitivity, high temporal and spatial resolution and versatility that allows not only remote detection of different targets but their imaging within the living cells. The basic mechanism of sensing is the transmission of the signal produced by molecular interaction with the target to fluorescent molecules, nanoparticles and nanocomposites with the detection by devices based on modern electronics and optics. In this interdisciplinary field of research and development the book is primarily intended to be a guide for students and young researchers.

Drawn from contributions made at the latest gathering in Lyon, France, Interpol\u2019s Forensic Science Review is a one-source reference providing a comprehensive literature review of each of the subject areas. Divided into five sections spanning the spectrum of forensic analysis, the book begins with chemical criminalistics, starting with a chapter on the forensic examination of fibres. Next, it examines firearms and ballistics, toolmarks, footwear impressions, and other contact marks such as tire treads. A chapter on forensic geology includes related sciences such as palynology. The first section concludes with a review of articles concerning paint and glass and methods for analysis of these substances. The second section focuses on drugs and toxicology. It examines improvements in the detection and analysis of abused substances, highlighting tests that are faster, more discriminatory, more sensitive, and less costly, providing hundreds of references to various studies conducted worldwide. Shifting to an exploration of electronic evidence, the next section begins with forensic audio and visual evidence and then moves to digital evidence found on computers and telecommunication and electronic multimedia devices, an area that has exploded in technological progress since the last symposium. The fourth section of the book begins with a discussion of hazardous materials, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear substances. It discusses new developments in environmental forensic science, with an increased emphasis on the field work necessary in investigation as well as advice on suggested equipment and online educational resources. The section concludes with a discussion of the analysis and detection of explosives and explosive residues, as well as scientific methods applied to fire cause and fire debris analysis. Finally, the book focuses on individual identification. It examines biological evidence screening and advances in DNA profiling during the past three years and explores questioned documents with a discussion of ink analysis and handwriting. The book concludes with a survey of the literature concerning fingerprints, bitemarks, and other impressions. The international scope of contributions to this volume makes it the most comprehensive source of information in the field today. Supplemented by hundreds of references to periodicals, textbooks, internet sources, and the proceedings of various working groups, the book identifies trends and their potential effects on forensic science and creates bridges with the international forensic science community supporting Interpol\u2019s mission.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439826591"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439826595"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 798, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA755&dq=Bioanalytical+Chemistry&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&dq=Bioanalytical+Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Interpol_s_Forensic_Science_Review.html?hl=&id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Interpol_s_Forensic_Science_Review-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Bl7vBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Analytical and <b>Bioanalytical Chemistry</b>, 2006. 385: p. 422-424.

The primary focus is on the extraordinary advantages of specificity and sensitivity obtained by integrating DNA nanostructures in bioanalytical devices. DNA Nanotechnology for Bioanalysis provides a concise and rigorous description for the fabrication of various types of functional nanostructures by optimized software-aided high-yield synthesis. Following this is the explanation of methods to decorate these nanostructures with molecules such as proteins, metal nanoparticles or bioorganic moieties covalently bonded onto DNA via self-assemblage processes. Also provided is a concise review on non-canonical DNA structures (such as G-quadruplexes) and their targeting by small molecules for applications in pharmacology.

While there are a few books dedicated to bioanalysis and biomarkers in general, until now there were none devoted exclusively to addressing critical issues surrounding this area of intense research. Targeted Biomarker Quantitation by LC-MS provides a detailed blueprint for quantifying biomarkers in biological systems. It uses numerous real-world cases to exemplify key concepts, all of which were carefully selected and presented so as to allow the concepts they embody to be easily expanded to future applications, including new biomarker development. Targeted Biomarker Quantitation by LC-MS primarily focuses on the assay establishment for biomarker quantitation\u2014a critical issue rarely treated in depth. It offers comprehensive coverage of three core areas of biomarker assay establishment: the relationship between the measured biomarkers and their intended usage; contemporary regulatory requirements for biomarker assays (a thorough understanding of which is essential for producing a successful and defendable submission); and the technical challenges of analyzing biomarkers produced inside a living organism or cell. Covers the theory of and applications for state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and chromatography and their applications in biomarker analysis Features real-life examples illustrating the challenges involved in targeted biomarker quantitation and the innovative approaches which have been used to overcome those challenges Addresses potential obstacles to obtain effective biomarker level and data interpretation, such as specificity establishment and sample collection Outlines a tiered approach and fit-for-purpose assay protocol for targeted biomarker quantitation Highlights the current state of the biomarker regulatory environment and protocol standards Targeted Biomarker Quantitation by LC-MS is a valuable resource for bioanalytical scientists, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics scientists, clinical scientists, analytical chemists, and others for whom biomarker quantitation is an important tool of the trade.

The main goal of green analytical chemistry is to avoid or reduce the undesirable environmental side effects of chemical analysis, while preserving the classic analytical parameters of accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity and precision. This book portrays the current and changing situation concerning adoption of the principles of green chemistry as applied to analysis. It begins by looking at the advantages of and problems associated with on-site analysis and how analytical techniques can lead to increased productivity, efficiency and accuracy, and thereby reduce the consumption of materials. It then focuses on sample preparation techniques minimising solvent consumption or using alternative solvents, concepts and methods of improving the \u2018greenness\u2019 of instrumental analysis where miniaturization is an important part, separation methods from the perspective of green analytical chemistry and chemometrics approaches, which can reduce or can even remove the need for conventional steps in chemical analysis.

The plethora of product devices, formulations, and flavors, combined with the lack of industry standards and labeling requirements, quality control, and limited product oversight, has given rise to public concern about initiation of use and potential for adverse exposure and negative long-term health outcomes. This volume discusses how analytical methods can address these issues and support the manufacturing, labeling, distribution, testing, regulation, and monitoring for consistency of products with known chemical content and demonstrated performance characteristics. The book begins with the background on aerosol drug delivery services and e-cigarettes, constituents of nicotine-containing liquid dosing formulations, typical use scenarios and associated aerosol emissions, and chemical exposures and pharmacological and toxicological effect profiles, and then continues with descriptions of the analytical methods used to characterize the chemicals in formulations and emissions from e-cigarettes, including their stability, physical particle-size distribution and thermal degradation under commonly employed conditions of use. Analytical methods enabling detection of biomarkers of exposure and harm in complex biological matrices are discussed, with an emphasis on constituents or emissions of current medicinal interest or with potential to produce harm. Opportunities and challenges for analytical chemistry in supporting the continued development and use of safe and consistent dosage formulations as alternatives to tobacco products are also explored, with a concluding section describing an analytical approach to a risk-benefit assessment of e-cigarette use on human health. The Emerging Issues in Analytical Chemistry series is published in partnership with RTI International and edited by Brian F. Thomas.

With technical advances in a variety of nanoscale fabrication and manipulation technologies, the whole topical area is maturing into a vibrant field that is generating new scientific research and a burgeoning range of commercial applications, with an annual market already at the trillion dollar threshold. The means of fabricating and controlling matter on the nanoscale afford striking and unprecedented opportunities to exploit a variety of exotic phenomena such as quantum, nanophotonic and nanoelectromechanical effects. Moreover, researchers are elucidating new perspectives on the electronic and optical properties of matter because of the way that nanoscale materials bridge the disparate theories describing molecules and bulk matter. Surface phenomena also gain a greatly increased significance; even the well-known link between chemical reactivity and surface-to-volume ratio becomes a major determinant of physical properties, when it operates over nanoscale dimensions. Against this background, this comprehensive work is designed to address the need for a dynamic, authoritative and readily accessible source of information, capturing the full breadth of the subject. Its six volumes, covering a broad spectrum of disciplines including material sciences, chemistry, physics and life sciences, have been written and edited by an outstanding team of international experts. Addressing an extensive, cross-disciplinary audience, each chapter aims to cover key developments in a scholarly, readable and critical style, providing an indispensible first point of entry to the literature for scientists and technologists from interdisciplinary fields. The work focuses on the major classes of nanomaterials in terms of their synthesis, structure and applications, reviewing nanomaterials and their respective technologies in well-structured and comprehensive articles with extensive cross-references. It has been a constant surprise and delight to have found, amongst the rapidly escalating number who work in nanoscience and technology, so many highly esteemed authors willing to contribute. Sharing our anticipation of a major addition to the literature, they have also captured the excitement of the field itself in each carefully crafted chapter.
