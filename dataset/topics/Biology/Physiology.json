Their work shows that when given a choice of natural foods, livestock have an astoundingly refined palate, nibbling through the day on as many as fifty kinds of grasses, forbs, and shrubs to meet their nutritional needs with remarkable precision. In Nourishment Provenza presents his thesis of the wisdom body, a wisdom that links flavor-feedback relationships at a cellular level with biochemically rich foods to meet the body's nutritional and medicinal needs. Provenza explores the fascinating complexity of these relationships as he raises and answers thought-provoking questions about what we can learn from animals about nutritional wisdom. What kinds of memories form the basis for how herbivores, and humans, recognize foods? Can a body develop nutritional and medicinal memories in utero and early in life? Do humans still possess the wisdom to select nourishing diets? Or, has that ability been hijacked by nutritional \"authorities\"? Consumers eager for a \"quick fix\" have empowered the multibillion-dollar-a-year supplement industry, but is taking supplements and enriching and fortifying foods helping us, or is it hurting us? On a broader scale Provenza explores the relationships among facets of complex, poorly understood, ever-changing ecological, social, and economic systems in light of an unpredictable future. To what degree do we lose contact with life-sustaining energies when the foods we eat come from anywhere but where we live? To what degree do we lose the mythological relationship that links us physically and spiritually with Mother Earth who nurtures our lives? Provenza's paradigm-changing exploration of these questions has implications that could vastly improve our health through a simple change in the way we view our relationships with the plants and animals we eat. Our health could be improved by eating biochemically rich foods and by creating cultures that know how to combine foods into meals that nourish and satiate. Provenza contends the voices of \"authority\" disconnect most people from a personal search to discover the inner wisdom that can nourish body and spirit. That journey means embracing wonder and uncertainty and avoiding illusions of stability and control as we dine on a planet in a universe bent on consuming itself.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603588027"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603588027"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Nourishment.html?hl=&id=KM50DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KM50DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "OM2YVKfnQGMC", "etag": "DaCaY0aKerI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/OM2YVKfnQGMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Neuropeptides and Other Bioactive Peptides", "subtitle": "From Discovery to Function", "authors": ["Lloyd D.

G protein\u2013 coupled receptors (GPCRs), including \u00df-adrenergic receptors, constitute the most ubiquitous superfamily of plasma membrane receptors and represent the single most important type of therapeutic drug target. Sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, which characterizes several cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and hypertension, as well as physiological ageing, has been proved to exert in the long-term detrimental effects in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. Acutely, sympathetic hyperactivity represents the response to an insult to the myocardium, aiming to compensate for decreased cardiac output. This process involves the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors by catecholamine with consequent heart rate and cardiac contractility increase. However, long-term exposure of the heart to elevated norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, originating from sympathetic nerve endings and chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland, results in further progressive deterioration in cardiac structure and function. At the molecular level, sustained sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity is responsible for several alterations including altered beta-adrenergic receptor signaling and function (down-regulation/ desensitization). Moreover, the detrimental effects of catecholamine affect also the function of different cell types including, but not limited to, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Thus, the success of beta-blocker therapy is due, at least in part, to the protection of the heart and the vasculature from the noxious effects of augmented catecholamine levels. The research topic aimed to support the progress towards understanding the role of sympathetic nervous system under physiological conditions, and the contribution of its hyperactivity in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular diseases.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889197316"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "288919731X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Adrenergic_System_in_Cardiovascular.html?hl=&id=45mxDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=45mxDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Yv6syPooywoC", "etag": "XC4h2ou/8QY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Yv6syPooywoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Principles of Animal Design", "subtitle": "The Optimization and Symmorphosis Debate", "authors": ["Ewald R.

HRV describes changes in heartbeat intervals, which are caused by autonomic neural regulation, i.e. by the interplay of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The most frequent application of HRV is connected to cardiological issues, most importantly to the monitoring of post-myocardial infarction patients and the prediction of sudden cardiac death. Analysis of HRV is also frequently applied in relation to diabetes, renal failure, neurological and psychiatric conditions, sleep disorders, psychological phenomena such as stress, as well as drug and addiction research including alcohol and smoking. The widespread application of HRV measurements is based on the fact that they are noninvasive, easy to perform, and in general reproducible \u2013 if carried out under standardized conditions. However, the amount of parameters to be analysed is still rising. Well-established time domain and frequency domain parameters are discussed controversially when it comes to their physiological interpretation and their psychometric properties like reliability and validity, and the sensitivity to cardiovascular properties of the variety of parameters seems to be a topic for further research. Recently introduced parameters like pNNxx and new dynamic methods such as approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis offer new potentials and warrant standardization. However, HRV is significantly associated with average heart rate (HR) and one can conclude that HRV actually provides information on two quantities, i.e. on HR and its variability. It is hard to determine which of these two plays a principal role in the clinical value of HRV. The association between HRV and HR is not only a physiological phenomenon but also a mathematical one which is due to non-linear (mathematical) relationship between RR interval and HR. If one normalizes HRV to its average RR interval, one may get \u2018pure\u2019 variability free from the mathematical bias. Recently, a new modification method of the association between HRV and HR has been developed which enables us to completely remove the HRV dependence on HR (even the physiological one), or conversely enhance this dependence. Such an approach allows us to explore the HR contribution to the clinical significance of HRV, i.e. whether HR or its variability plays a main role in the HRV clinical value.

Regardless this essential function, the CB has been implicated in the sensing of other physiological signals such as changes in blood flow and glucose levels. More important, malfunction of the CB chemoreceptors has been associated with the progression and deterioration of several disease states such as hypertension, heart failure, renal failure, insulin resistance, diabetes and sleep apnea. Although the mechanisms involved in the alterations of the CB function in pathophysiology are currently under intense research, the development of therapeutic approaches to restore normal CB chemoreflex function remains unsolved. Recent studies showing the effect of CB denervation in pathophysiology have unveiled a key role of these arterial chemoreceptors in the development of autonomic imbalance and respiratory disturbances, and suggest that targeting the CB could represent a novel strategy to improve disease outcome. Unfortunately, classical pharmacotherapy intended to normalize CB function may be hard to establish since several cellular pathways are involved in the CB dysfunction. Augmented levels of angiotensin II, endothelin-1, cytokines and free radicals along with decreases in nitric oxide had all been related to the CB dysfunction. Moreover, changes in expression of angiotensin receptors, nitric oxide synthases and cytokines that take place within the CB tissue in pathological states also contribute to the enhanced CB chemoreflex drive. It has been shown in heart failure, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea that the CB becomes tonically hyper-reactive. During the progression of the disease this CB chemosensory facilitation process induces central nervous system plasticity. The altered autonomic-respiratory control leads to increased cardiorespiratory distress and the deterioration of the condition. The focus of this e-book will be to cover the role of the CB in pathophysiology and to provide new evidence of the pathways involved in the maladaptive potentiation of the CB chemoreflex function.

Teeth are vital organs containing a rich number of blood vessels and nerve fibers within the dental pulp and periodontium. Teeth are composed by unique and specific collagenous (dentin, fibrillar cementum) and non-collagenous (enamel) highly mineralized extracellular matrices. Alveolar bone is another collagenous hard tissue that supports tooth stability and function through its close interaction with the periodontal ligament. Dental hard tissues are often damaged after infection or traumatic injuries that lead to the partial or complete destruction of the functional dental and supportive tissues. Well-established protocols are routinely used in dental clinics for the restoration or replacement of the damaged tooth and alveolar bone areas. Recent progress in the fields of cell biology, tissue engineering, and nanotechnology offers promising opportunities to repair damaged or missing dental tissues. Indeed, pulp and periodontal tissue regeneration is progressing rapidly with the application of stem cells, biodegradable scaffolds, and growth factors. Furthermore, methods that enable partial dental hard tissue repair and regeneration are being evaluated with variable degrees of success. However, these cell-based therapies are still incipient and many issues need to be addressed before any clinical application. The understanding of tooth and periodontal tissues formation would be beneficial for improving regenerative attempts in dental clinics. In the present e-book we have covered the various aspects dealing with dental and periodontal tissues physiology and regeneration in 6 chapters: 1. General principles on the use of stem cells for regenerating craniofacial and dental tissues 2. The roles of nerves, vessels and stem cell niches in tissue regeneration 3. Dental pulp regeneration and mechanisms of various odontoblast functions 4. Dental root and periodontal physiology, pathology and regeneration 5.

Most patients are worried about resuming oral intake, particularly when the surgery has altered the GI tract normal physiology removing organs (e.g. total colectomy) or part of them, or modifying the natural sequence of the different GI tract parts (e.g. after esophagectomy or pancreatectomy). Patients may also worry about the possible complications of an inappropriate alimentation. As a matter of fact, several metabolic processes can be modified by GI tract surgery (e.g. major liver resection or pancreatectomy), thus making the nutritional support essential: and the same support is fundamental in bariatric surgery, nowadays widely used for super-obese patients. There is therefore a need for a nutritional guide in surgery and in troubleshooting postoperative cases where nutrition is a major issue This book offers nutritionists insights into the possible alterations of GI tract physiology occurring after surgery, and will be a valuable resource for surgeons, gastroenterologists, coloproctologists, nutritionists and clinical specialist nurses, seeking guidance on postoperative nutrition.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030165543"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "303016554X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 148, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7139, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7139, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XAGfDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7139000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7139000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nutritional_Support_after_Gastrointestin-sample-epub.acsm?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nutritional_Support_after_Gastrointestin-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XAGfDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oR8hpcQwc2QC", "etag": "mukWvk3fnnc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oR8hpcQwc2QC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Physiology Or Medicine", "subtitle": "1981-1990", "authors": ["Tore Fr\u0084ngsmyr", "Jan E.

Here we discover how the turtle\u2019s proverbial slowness helps it survive a long, cold winter under ice. How the shell not only serves as a protective home but also influences such essential functions as buoyancy control, breathing, and surviving remarkably long periods without oxygen, and how many other physiological features help define this unique animal.

Along the way we also learn something about the process of scientific discovery\u2014how the answer to one question leads to new questions, how a chance observation can change the direction of study, and above all how new research always builds on the previous work of others.

Nature has shaped echolocation, an active sense that engages audiomotor feedback systems, which operates in diverse environments and situations. Echolocation production and perception vary across species, and signals are often adapted to the environment and task. In the last several decades, researchers have been studying the echolocation behavior of animals, both in the air and underwater, using different methodologies and perspectives. The result of these studies has led to rich knowledge on sound production mechanisms, directionality of the sound beam, signal design, echo reception and perception. Active control over echolocation signal production and the mechanisms for echo processing ultimately provide animals with an echoic scene or image of their surroundings. Sonar signal features directly influence the information available for the echolocating animal to perceive images of its environment. In many echolocating animals, the information processed through echoes elicits a reaction in motor systems, including adjustments in subsequent echolocation signals. We are interested in understanding how echolocating animals deal with different environments (e.g. clutter, light levels), tasks, distance to targets or objects, different prey types or other food sources, presence of conspecifics or certain predators, ambient and anthropogenic noise. In recent years, some researchers have presented new data on the origins of echolocation, which can provide a hint of its evolution. Theoreticians have addressed several issues that bear on echolocation systems, such as frequency or time resolution, target localization and beam-forming mechanisms. In this Research Topic we compiled recent work that elucidates how echolocation \u2013 from sound production, through echolocation signals to perception- has been shaped by nature functioning in different environments and situations. We strongly encouraged comparative approaches that would deepen our understanding of the processes comprising this active sense.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889193479"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889193470"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ulM6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ulM6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ulM6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ulM6BgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_nature_shaped_echolocation_in_animal.html?hl=&id=ulM6BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ulM6BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TiZ0DgAAQBAJ", "etag": "oDqz9hxN7Ks", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TiZ0DgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Open Wide", "subtitle": "The Ultimate Guide to Teeth", "authors": ["Susan Grigsby"], "publishedDate": "2017-05-01", "description": "Discover a world of mystery, history, and lore inside your mouth.

Other emergent areas of 1a,25(OH)2D3 action are in the control of immune functions, cellular growth and differentiation. This fits both with the widespread expression of the VDR and the above described consequences of vitamin D deficiency. Transcriptome-wide analysis indicated that per cell type between 200 and 600 genes are primary targets of vitamin D. Since most of these genes respond to vitamin D in a cell-specific fashion, the total number of vitamin D targets in the human genome is far higher than 1,000. This is supported by the genome-wide view on VDR binding sites in human lymphocytes, monocytes, colon and hepatic cells. All genomic actions of 1a,25(OH)2D3 are mediated by the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) that has been the subject of intense study since the 1980\u2019s. Thus, vitamin D signaling primarily implies the molecular actions of the VDR. In this research topic, we present in 15 chapters different perspectives on the action of vitamin D and its receptor, such as the impact of the genomewide distribution of VDR binding loci, ii) the transcriptome- and proteome-wide effects of vitamin D, iii) the role of vitamin D in health, iv) tissue-specific functions of vitamin D and v) the involvement of vitamin D in different diseases, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, diabetes and different types of cancer.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889193493"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889193497"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Genome_wide_view_on_the_physiology_of_vi.html?hl=&id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=m1U6BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FwKzKM4sdEoC", "etag": "G+hqK3A2jnc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FwKzKM4sdEoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Sleep and Wakefulness", "authors": ["Nathaniel Kleitman"], "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "publishedDate": "1963", "description": "For half a century, Sleep and Wakefulness has been a valuable reference work.

Ostojic"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "publishedDate": "2016-05-25", "description": "Physiological responses after maximal and submaximal exercise are routinely monitored in a plethora of diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, asthma, neuromuscular disorders), and normal populations (e.g. athletes, youth, elderly), while slower or irregular post-exercise recovery usually indicates poor health and/or low fitness level. Abnormal post-exercise recovery (as assessed via blunted post-exercise heart rate dynamics) helps to predict the presence and severity of coronary artery disease, while differences in recovery outcomes in athletes might discriminate between fit and unfit individuals. Disturbances in post-exercise recovery might be due to acute or persistent changes in: (1) adaptive responses mediated by the autonomic nervous system and vasodilator substances, (2) cellular bioenergetics, and/or (3) muscular plasticity. Preliminary evidence suggests possible role of time-dependent modulation of nitric oxide synthase and adenosine receptors during post-exercise recovery, yet no molecular attributes of post-exercise recovery are revealed so far. Currently several markers of post-exercise recovery are used (e.g. heart rate measures, hormone profiles, biochemical and hematological indices); however none of them meets all criteria to make its use generally accepted as the gold standard. In addition, recent studies suggest that different pharmacological agents and dietary interventions, or manipulative actions (e.g. massage, cold-water immersion, compression garments, athletic training) administered before, during or immediately after exercise could positively affect post-exercise recovery. There is a growing interest to provide more evidence-based data concerning the effectiveness and safety of traditional and novel interventions to affect post-exercise recovery. The goals of this research topic are to critically evaluate the current advances on mechanisms and clinical implications of post-exercise recovery, and to summarize recent experimental data from interventional studies. This knowledge may help to identify the hierarchy of key mechanisms, and recognize methods to monitor and improve post-exercise recovery in both health and disease.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9782889198559"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "2889198553"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Post_Exercise_Recovery_Fundamental_and_I.html?hl=&id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BEUoDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0MdTBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "rv0LjXN/Yfc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0MdTBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Nikolai Bernstein - from Reflex to the Model of the Future", "subtitle": "From Reflexes to the Model of the Future", "authors": ["Josef M.

How do these different components of the cardiovascular system interact during stress? Which cardiovascular responses to stress are the most important for identifying normal, depressed, and enhanced cardiovascular function? Can these stress-induced responses assist with patient diagnosis and prognosis? What impact does physical fitness have on the relationship between cardiovascular function and health?

This well-researched text by a leading expert in the field provides a foundational map of the human brain for cognition and behavior. This comprehensive map of essential human thinking and emotion is based on the explosion in the field of functional neuroimaging studies (fMRI, PET) in the normally functioning human brain. The approach of this text is to confirm the association of these brain regions by verifying that damage to the activated brain area results in a consistent deficit in the cognitive/behavioral operation under investigation. The approach used to form this view of mapping brain and cognition is based on cognitive neuroscience principles of defining dissociable, fine-grained cognitive units and associating these units with brain regions encoding for these units or aspects of the units from both functional imaging and lesion studies. These cognitive-brain relationships are incorporated into clinical syndromes to account for the behavior of these patients after a lesion occurs, with the added feature of presenting patient videos demonstrating the disrupted cognitive behaviors. This comprehensive textbook provides a framework of the basic architecture of cognition in the brain with this combination of activation and lesion study confirmation of the brain-behavior associations. This basic framework is useful for those students studying the interaction of cognitive science and neuroanatomy as well as being relevant to the experienced neuroscientist researcher or clinician.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190219031"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190219033"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e9eeCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e9eeCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=e9eeCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=e9eeCgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Neurobiology_of_Cognition_and_Behavi.html?hl=&id=e9eeCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=e9eeCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "OKdpDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "ih/jeWya+cA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/OKdpDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Mathematical Nature of the Living World", "subtitle": "The Power of Integration", "authors": ["Gilbert Chauvet"], "publisher": "World Scientific", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "The topic of the book \u2014 a theory of functional biology that incorporates the fundamental principles underlying the functioning of living organisms \u2014 is clearly appropriate as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the discovery by Watson and Crick of the structure of the DNA molecule. 'The Mathematical Nature of the Living World: The Power of Integration' is here to remind us that the world of biology is anchored in the world of mathematics and physics, and that, to understand the living world, we need to incorporate the laws of the nonliving matter. In particular, an important emphasis of the book concerns the relationships between structure and function, a point so well illustrated by the work of Watson and Crick. A nice aspect of Chauvet's book is that he does place his work and his approach in a general framework and historical background of the work performed by pioneers in a variety of fields ranging from physics to biology.

When trying to answer questions such as why salmon can adjust to life in fresh water as well as seawater, or why chilli peppers taste hot to humans but evoke little response from chickens, we often find the answers lie in patterns of movement of these ions and their roles in sensing, transmitting and collecting messages. Bringing together scattered literature on calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium in biology, this book examines important biological contributions of these ions including enzyme activation, effects in all types of muscle and biomineralization. Attention is focused on: channel construction and ion movement; calcium as a second messenger and in the construction of solids and ion channelopathies, with the help of personalities such as Agatha Christie, van Gogh and Captain Cook.

An extensive introduction reconstructs the complex manuscript tradition and examines the origin and nature of the collection, which is argued to be complex, including two distinct groups of problems from approximately the time of Alexander (the second to third centuries AD) together with other material which is similar in character and origin to the Problems included in standard editions of Aristotle, compiled in the third century BC and in some cases related to extant or lost works by Aristotle's colleague Theophrastus.

Descartes", "authors": ["Dennis Des Chene"], "publisher": "Cornell University Press", "publishedDate": "2001", "description": "Although the basis of modern biology is Cartesian, Descartes's theories of biology have been more often ridiculed than studied. Yet, Dennis Des Chene demonstrates, the themes, arguments, and vocabulary of his mechanistic biology pervade the writings of many seventeenth-century authors. In his illuminating account of Cartesian physiology in its historical context, Des Chene focuses on the philosopher's innovative reworking of that field, including the nature of life, the problem of generation, and the concepts of health and illness. Des Chene begins by surveying works that Descartes would likely have encountered, from late Aristotelian theories of the soul to medical literature and treatises on machines. The Cartesian theory of vital operations is examined with particular attention to the generation of animals. Des Chene also considers the role of the machine-model in furnishing a method in physiology, the ambiguities of the notion of machine, and of Descartes's problem of simulation. Finally, he looks at the various kinds of unity of the body, both in itself and in its union with the soul.

With modern methods of measurement it is possible to enter the structure \u2013 function relationship much more deeply, even down to a molecular level, which was not possible two and a half decades ago. It is a well known fact that, in biology, the more sophisticated the measuring method, the greater the achievement of biological fundamental research, and its resulting evidence.

Keeping horses is increasingly popular in the Western world and is of major importance in many developing countries. However, the conditions in which horses are kept are very different from the environment of wild horses, which leads to many adverse effects on their welfare and behaviour. This book describes the development of horse behaviour, and the way in which the management of horses today affects their welfare. Horses for sport, companionship and work are considered and ways of improving their welfare by better training and management is described.

To gain from European scientific, technical and educational advancements, the Russian Government began to permit studies abroad and relaxed censorship, which brought a new flood of literature into the country. These measures enormously facilitated the growth of Russian science, medicine and education in the late nineteenth century, taking the Empire into a fascinating era of laboratory research, a new cultural and intellectual tradition. The Imperial Laboratorytells the story of the lives and studies of the leading Russian and German clinician\u2013experimenters who played critical roles in the integration of physics and chemistry into physiology and clinical medicine. A principal theme is the major transformations undergone in military medicine and education. Using a wide range of Russian and German primary sources, this book offers a unique English-language insight into Russian physiology and medicine that will be of interest to both historians and doctors, as well as anyone interested in Russian science and culture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789042026582"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9042026588"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 374, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LDE4133Ocd0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5741.63, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5741.63, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&rdid=book-LDE4133Ocd0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5741630000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5741630000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Imperial_Laboratory-sample-epub.acsm?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Imperial_Laboratory-sample-pdf.acsm?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=LDE4133Ocd0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oINIAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "/HSjlqAPkuY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oINIAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Anatomy and Physiology Made Incredibly Visual!", "authors": ["Lippincott Williams & Wilkins"], "publisher": "Lippincott Williams & Wilkins", "publishedDate": "2013-12-24", "description": "Anatomy & Physiology Made Incredibly Visual is an innovative new reference that brings clinical subjects to life using a vivid, graphic presentation. Like the Incredibly Easy series, the Incredibly Visual series takes difficult clinical topics and presents them in a clear, concise, easy-to-understand manner. The highly visual nature of this book makes anatomy and physiology fundamentals accessible to the reader in a unique and interesting way that enables quick review and comprehension as well as practical application. For each body system, the book logically first presents anatomic fundamentals necessary to understand the complex physiology of the body. Then physiologic processes are presented more visually than ever before. This new approach to clinical content maximizes the power of visual thinking by getting readers as close to the clinical content as they can get without actually being in the room with a patient. Complex ideas are broken down into their component parts, with each component made unmistakably simple in appealingly colorful and graphic ways. Readers will read less, understand more, and see things more clearly than every before.

Methods of data analysis and applications (7) 4. Statistical models and methods (4) 5. Bayesian learning (5) 6. Conceptual classification, knowledge ordering and information systems (12) 7. Linguistics and dialectometry (4). These chapters are interrelated in many respects. The reader may recogni ze, for example, the analogies and distinctions existing among classification principles developed in such different domains as statistics and information sciences, the benefit to be gained by the comparison of conceptual and ma thematical approaches for structuring data and knowledge, and, finally, the wealth of practical applications described in many of the papers.

An account of his activities in 1629 reports that he visited butcher shops on an almost daily basis to study specific animal organs, and he practiced dissection and even vivisection to explore the workings of major organ systems. In the 1630s, he assisted in the dissection of human cadavers - all to satisfy his intense curiosity about how bodies, animal and human, work. The fruits of this research can be found in his Treatise of Man, a work that he decided not to publish for fear of suffering the same fate as Galileo. Consequently, this fascinating treatise did not appear until twelve years after his death. Among its many intriguing features are his detailed descriptions of the nervous system and its interactions with the muscles to create movement in response to stimulus. Though we now know that many of these details are wrong, Descartes' understanding that much of the body functions as a machine was a stroke of genius. He is the first to describe the reflex arc, anticipating Pavlov and the behaviorists by almost 300 years. The idea of the body as a kind of animal machine that functions according to physical laws was an immense advance over the previous scholastic notions based on Aristotle, which merely begged the question of how the various organs of the body work by stating that it is in their nature to perform their specific functions. This is a landmark work that students of history, medicine, biology, and the history of science will find richly rewarding.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "NWU:35556037515608"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 122, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vW8gAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vW8gAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vW8gAQAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vW8gAQAAMAAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Treatise_of_Man.html?hl=&id=vW8gAQAAMAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vW8gAQAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "JN9qAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "2te+REfW6Xs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JN9qAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Encyclopedia of Human Biology", "authors": ["Renato Dulbecco"], "publishedDate": "1991", "description": "Encyclopedia intended for a wide audience, i.e., from general readers to researchers and scientists.

This question implies that the auditory experience of various animals is not the same. The recognition that the sense organs of animals may be quite different to those of man is crucial to understanding animal behavior and to the establishment of the science of sensory physiology. \"Auditory Worlds\" provides in a succinct form a report of fifteen years of research activity on the hearing system of vertebrates. Scientists from a broad range of backgrounds contributed to this collaborative research effort. They used almost every available approach to studying the ear and the \"hearing brain\". There were engineers with interests in measuring and defining sound and the human perception of it, and human perception of speech and music. Others trained in zoology concentrated their efforts in understanding the structure and function of hearing organs of different vertebrate groups (reptiles, birds and mammals). Some groups worked towards understanding how the brain processes auditory information that is important during sound production and vocalization in animals or the acoustic signals relevant to behavior. A comparison to perception in hearing-impaired humans was established. Concerted effort made it possible to understand the relationship between physiology on the one hand and psychoacoustics on the other in both animal and man. New methodologies, such as the measurement of otoacoustic emissions, became established during the tenure of this project and had significant influence on the kind of work carried out in later years. This book is not a sequence of individual projects' reports. The chapters do not correspond to projects, but have been jointly written by several researchers in each case. There was a strong desire to produce data of interest to the widest possible audience.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UVA:X004397539"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 359, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kJAoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kJAoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kJAoAAAAYAAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&cd=118&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kJAoAAAAYAAJ&dq=subject:Physiology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Auditory_Worlds_Sensory_Analysis_and_Per.html?hl=&id=kJAoAAAAYAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kJAoAAAAYAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ygNrAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "y0rbDdQJeeM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ygNrAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Digital Biosignal Processing", "authors": ["Rolf Weitkunat"], "publisher": "Elsevier Science Limited", "publishedDate": "1991-01-01", "description": "Hardbound. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is the fundamental tool of biomedical data analysis, just as a telescope is in astronomy. Assuming data has been correctly gathered according to a well-designed protocol, the effectiveness of the application of DSP techniques determines the success of a study. Unfortunately, since DSP is a relatively new branch of electrical engineering and applied mathematics, and is not usually included in the curricula of psychological, biological or medical science educational programs, the vast majority of biomedical researchers are inadequately prepared in DSP, and are thus at a severe disadvantage in conducting their research.The problem is not easily rectified since DSP is a technically complex area to study, which, at the least, requires prerequisite knowledge of linear algebra, calculus and the physics of electricity.
