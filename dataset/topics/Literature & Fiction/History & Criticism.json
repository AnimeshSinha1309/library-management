This innovative book examines the most successful interracial coalition in the nineteenth-century South, Virginia's Readjuster Party, and uncovers a surprising degree of fluidity in postemancipation southern politics. Melding social, cultural, and political history, Jane Dailey chronicles the Readjusters' efforts to foster political cooperation across the color line. She demonstrates that the power of racial rhetoric, and the divisiveness of racial politics, derived from the everyday experiences of individual Virginians_from their local encounters on the sidewalk, before the magistrate's bench, in the schoolroom. In the process, she reveals the power of black and white southerners to both create and resist new systems of racial discrimination. The story of the Readjusters shows how hard white southerners had to work to establish racial domination after emancipation, and how passionately black southerners fought each and every infringement of their rights as Americans.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780807825877"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0807825875"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 278, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_IbZA5AG5F0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_IbZA5AG5F0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_IbZA5AG5F0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_IbZA5AG5F0C&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Before_Jim_Crow.html?hl=&id=_IbZA5AG5F0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_IbZA5AG5F0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "RUYaDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "/538uDDaJ8U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RUYaDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Dwellers on the Nile", "subtitle": "The Life, History, Religion and Literature of the Ancient Egyptians", "authors": ["E.

Jacqueline Goldsby shows that lynching cannot be explained away as a phenomenon peculiar to the South or as the perverse culmination of racist politics. Rather, lynching\u2014a highly visible form of social violence that has historically been shrouded in secrecy\u2014was in fact a fundamental part of the national consciousness whose cultural logic played a pivotal role in the making of American modernity. To pursue this argument, Goldsby traces lynching's history by taking up select mob murders and studying them together with key literary works. She focuses on three prominent authors\u2014Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Stephen Crane, and James Weldon Johnson\u2014and shows how their own encounters with lynching influenced their analyses of it. She also examines a recently assembled archive of evidence\u2014lynching photographs\u2014to show how photography structured the nation's perception of lynching violence before World War I. Finally, Goldsby considers the way lynching persisted into the twentieth century, discussing the lynching of Emmett Till in 1955 and the ballad-elegies of Gwendolyn Brooks to which his murder gave rise. An empathic and perceptive work, A Spectacular Secret will make an important contribution to the study of American history and literature.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226301389"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0226301389"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 418, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Jgm90E-awUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Jgm90E-awUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3Jgm90E-awUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3Jgm90E-awUC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Spectacular_Secret.html?hl=&id=3Jgm90E-awUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Spectacular_Secret-sample-epub.acsm?id=3Jgm90E-awUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3Jgm90E-awUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "aukrBgAAQBAJ", "etag": "0y9WTEc5KT0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/aukrBgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lost Pharaohs", "authors": ["Cottrell"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2013-01-11", "description": "Published in the year 2006, Lost Pharaohs is a valuable contrubution to the field of History.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781136211096"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1136211098"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3138.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aukrBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3138800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lost_Pharaohs-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aukrBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "J-feCgAAQBAJ", "etag": "kl0H2daFM04", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/J-feCgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Stealing Secrets", "subtitle": "How a Few Daring Women Deceived Generals, Impacted Battles, and Altered the Course of the Civil War", "authors": ["H.

The bitter war between the CIA and the Navy and how it threatened to sabotage one of America's most important undersea missions. The audacious attempt to steal a Soviet submarine with the help of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes, and how it was doomed from the start. A magnificent achievement in investigative reporting, Blind Man's Bluff reads like a spy thriller, but with one important difference -- everything in it is true.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781586486785"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1586486780"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 19, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.6.8.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2207.84, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2207.84, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-wJs4DgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2207840000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2207840000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Blind_Man_s_Bluff-sample-epub.acsm?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wJs4DgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "kNzCDgAAQBAJ", "etag": "qweyd+eWRqI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kNzCDgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Warfare and Armed Conflicts", "subtitle": "A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492-2015, 4th ed.", "authors": ["Micheal Clodfelter"], "publisher": "McFarland", "publishedDate": "2017-04-24", "description": "In its revised and updated fourth edition, this exhaustive encyclopedia provides a record of casualties of war from the last five centuries through 2015, with new statistical and analytical information.

To this day, Bushido is considered a must-read for anyone who wants to understanding the soul of Japan and navigate their world with integrity and honor.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780834840331"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0834840332"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 160, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Comics & Graphic Novels"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1409.31, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1270, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-GYwuDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1409310000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1270000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bushido_Graphic_Novel-sample-epub.acsm?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bushido_Graphic_Novel-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GYwuDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "aP4QyAXsnmkC", "etag": "OGAVAuVXByg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/aP4QyAXsnmkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Din\u00e9", "subtitle": "A History of the Navajos", "authors": ["Peter Iverson"], "publisher": "UNM Press", "publishedDate": "2002", "description": "Based on archival research, traditional accounts, interviews, historic and contemporary photographs, and firsthand observation, Iverson provides a detailed and up-to-date portrait of the Din\u00e9, past and present.

Spirits were high when the Fairchild F-227 took off from Mendoza, Argentina, and headed for Santiago, Chile. On board were forty-five people, including an amateur rugby team from Uruguay and their friends and family. The skies were clear that Friday, October 13, 1972, and at 3:30 p.m., the Fairchild\u2019s pilot reported their altitude at 15,000 feet. But one minute later, the Santiago control tower lost all contact with the aircraft. For eight days, Chileans, Uruguayans, and Argentinians searched for it, but snowfall in the Andes had been heavy, and the odds of locating any wreckage were slim. Ten weeks later, a Chilean peasant in a remote valley noticed two haggard men desperately gesticulating to him from across a river. He threw them a pen and paper, and the note they tossed back read: \u201cI come from a plane that fell in the mountains . . .\u201d Sixteen of the original forty-five passengers on the F-227 survived its horrific crash. In the remote glacial wilderness, they camped in the plane\u2019s fuselage, where they faced freezing temperatures, life-threatening injuries, an avalanche, and imminent starvation. As their meager food supplies ran out, and after they heard on a patched-together radio that the search parties had been called off, it seemed like all hope was lost. To save their own lives, these men and women not only had to keep their faith, they had to make an impossible decision: Should they eat the flesh of their dead friends? A remarkable story of endurance and determination, friendship and the human spirit, Alive is the dramatic bestselling account of one of the most harrowing quests for survival in modern times.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781504039123"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1504039122"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 318, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.26.21.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 560.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 280.25, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UqHMDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 560500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 280250000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Alive-sample-epub.acsm?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Alive-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "O8arrZPM8moC", "etag": "MUTKzsRyuIE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/O8arrZPM8moC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "O City of Byzantium", "subtitle": "Annals of Niketas Choniat\u0113s", "authors": ["Nicetas Choniates", "Nicetas (Choniates)", "Nic\u00e9tas Choniate", "Harry J.

It thus occupies a key position in the long and fertile tradition of medieval beast-literature, but it also claims attention as a masterpiece in its own right, the work of one of the most daring and original satirists of the Middle Ages. Despite its importance, the \"Ysengrimus\" has been comparatively neglected because of its linguistic difficulties. Jill Mann eases these difficulties by presenting an English translation alongside the Latin text, and accompanying it with a detailed commentary. A full- length introduction offers an original account of the poem which shows how literary structure and historical dimensions are fused into an original satiric vision of compelling power. This book will not only interest medieval Latin specialists, but will make this major text accessible to those working on the related vernacular traditions. Its analysis of the poem's allusions to contemporary persons and events will also be of considerable interest to historians of twelfth-century Flanders.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9004081038"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789004081031"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 568, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Ysengrimus.html?hl=&id=cfi6BDAO3XQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cfi6BDAO3XQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "5K6xDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Lbd53HUm5uo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5K6xDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Winter Night", "subtitle": "English Translation of 'Poos ki Raat'", "authors": ["Premchand", "General Press"], "publisher": "GENERAL PRESS", "publishedDate": "2019-09-25", "description": "With a heavy heart, Halku walked towards his wife and said, \"The moneylender has come.

JUST THREE RUPEES.\u201d Her anger was evident in her tone, \u201cWe have kept it to buy a blanket for the upcoming winters. How will we survive these brutal wintry nights, if we give our savings to him? Tell him, we will pay him when we sell our crop. We don\u2019t have anything for him right now!\u201d Halku stood there not knowing what to do. He tried to put his thoughts in order, so as to take a decision. Winter season was at its peak and without a blanket there was no way he could sleep out in the open, guarding his fields all through the night. But he knew that refusing the money monger would be even worse. He thought, it was better to die in the open field under the dark sky than listening to the abuses being hurled at him. Clear in his mind now, he dragged his hefty self towards Munni and with a fake smile said, \u201cCome on, Munni. Give it to me. At least it will take the moneylender off my neck. I will think of something and get the blanket.\u201d But Munni was in no mood to listen to his fake promises. She moved away from him and said, \u201cAm fed up of you and your assurances. Tell me, what you are going to do about the blanket. Who will give it to you for free? Who knows, how fierce it\u2019s gonna be for us? We survived the last time, but this time it will kill us.\u201d She paused for a second, and continued, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave farming? Are we going to live like this forever?

The lectures were published in 1798, with the largest first printing of any of Kant's works. Intended for a broad audience, they reveal not only Kant's unique contribution to the newly emerging discipline of anthropology, but also his desire to offer students a practical view of the world and of humanity's place in it. With its focus on what the human being 'as a free-acting being makes of himself or can and should make of himself,' the Anthropology also offers readers an application of some central elements of Kant's philosophy.

'Ikigai urges individuals to simplify their lives by pursuing what sparks joy for them' (Marie '' Kondo) Every moment in our life happens only once, and if we let it slip away, we lose it forever-an idea captured by the Japanese phrase ichigo ichie. Often used to convey that the encounter is unique and special, it is a tenet of Zen Buddhism and is attributed to a sixteenth-century master of the Japanese tea ceremony, or 'ceremony of attention', whose intricate rituals compel us to focus on the present moment. From this age-old concept comes a new kind of mindfulness. In The Book of Ichigo Ichie, you will learn to use all five senses to anchor yourself in the present. Every one of us contains a key that can open the door to attention, harmony with others, and love of life. And that key is ichigo ichie. 'This is a great little book to lift the spirits and remind us of the importance of living in the 'now', not worrying about the past or future.' - 5* Reader Review 'This book should act as a wakeup call.

From the battles at Lexington and Concord in spring 1775 to those at Trenton and Princeton in winter 1777, American militiamen and then the ragged Continental Army take on the world\u2019s most formidable fighting force. It is a gripping saga alive with astonishing characters: Henry Knox, the former bookseller with an uncanny understanding of artillery; Nathanael Greene, the blue-eyed bumpkin who becomes a brilliant battle captain; Benjamin Franklin, the self-made man who proves to be the wiliest of diplomats; George Washington, the commander in chief who learns the difficult art of leadership when the war seems all but lost. The story is also told from the British perspective, making the mortal conflict between the redcoats and the rebels all the more compelling. Full of riveting details and untold stories, The British Are Coming is a tale of heroes and knaves, of sacrifice and blunder, of redemption and profound suffering. Rick Atkinson has given stirring new life to the first act of our country\u2019s creation drama.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781627790444"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1627790446"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 800, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.11.9.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JdFuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JdFuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JdFuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JdFuDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_British_Are_Coming.html?hl=&id=JdFuDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_British_Are_Coming-sample-epub.acsm?id=JdFuDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JdFuDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "C6B13ky6vkQC", "etag": "aO5P6lWWr+8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/C6B13ky6vkQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "American History", "subtitle": "A Very Short Introduction", "authors": ["Paul S.

The book offers a fresh account of the activities of the best-known conquistadors and explorers, including Columbus, Cort\u00e9s, and Pizarro. Using a wide array of sources, historian Matthew Restall highlights seven key myths, uncovering the source of the inaccuracies and exploding the fallacies and misconceptions behind each myth. This vividly written and authoritative book shows, for instance, that native Americans did not take the conquistadors for gods and that small numbers of vastly outnumbered Spaniards did not bring down great empires with stunning rapidity. We discover that Columbus was correctly seen in his lifetime--and for decades after--as a briefly fortunate but unexceptional participant in efforts involving many southern Europeans. It was only much later that Columbus was portrayed as a great man who fought against the ignorance of his age to discover the new world. Another popular misconception--that the Conquistadors worked alone--is shattered by the revelation that vast numbers of black and native allies joined them in a conflict that pitted native Americans against each other. This and other factors, not the supposed superiority of the Spaniards, made conquests possible. The Conquest, Restall shows, was more complex--and more fascinating--than conventional histories have portrayed it. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest offers a richer and more nuanced account of a key event in the history of the Americas.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0198036434"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780198036432"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.7.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=47&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 420.04, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 294.03, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&rdid=book-2hMp9z_OsUMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 420040000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 294030000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Seven_Myths_of_the_Spanish_Conquest-sample-epub.acsm?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Seven_Myths_of_the_Spanish_Conquest-sample-pdf.acsm?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2hMp9z_OsUMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nOt7au3N8FUC", "etag": "qS2pIGIpmhw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nOt7au3N8FUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Frederick Douglass", "subtitle": "Selected Speeches and Writings", "authors": ["Philip Foner", "Yuval Taylor"], "publisher": "Chicago Review Press", "publishedDate": "2000-04-01", "description": "One of the greatest African American leaders and one of the most brilliant minds of his time, Frederick Douglass spoke and wrote with unsurpassed eloquence on almost all the major issues confronting the American people during his life\u2014from the abolition of slavery to women\u2019s rights, from the Civil War to lynching, from American patriotism to black nationalism.

Commodus\u2019s passion for hunting animals was so fervent that he dreamt of shooting a tiger, an elephant, and a hippopotamus; his prowess was such that people claimed he never missed when hurling his javelin or firing arrows from his bow. For fourteen days near the end of AD 192, the emperor mounted one of the most lavish and spectacular gladiatorial games Rome had ever seen. Commodus himself was the star attraction, and people rushed from all over Italy to witness the spectacle. But this slaughter was simply the warm-up act to the main event: the emperor was also planning to fight as a gladiator. Why did Roman rulers spend vast resources on such over-the-top displays\u2014and why did some emperors appear in them as combatants? Why did the Roman rabble enjoy watching the slaughter of animals and the sight of men fighting to the death? And how best can we in the modern world understand what was truly at stake in the circus and the arena? In The Day Commodus Killed a Rhino, Jerry Toner set out to answer these questions by vividly describing what it would have been like to attend Commodus\u2019 fantastic shows and watch one of his many appearances as both hunter and fighter. Highlighting the massive logistical effort needed to supply the games with animals, performers, and criminals for execution, the book reveals how blood and gore were actually incidental to what really mattered. Gladiatorial games played a key role in establishing a forum for political debate between the rulers and the ruled. Roman crowds were not passive: they were made up of sophisticated consumers with their own political aims, which they used the games to secure. In addition, the games also served as a pure expression of what it meant to be a true Roman. Drawing on notions of personal honor, manly vigor, and sophisticated craftsmanship, the games were a story that the Romans loved to tell themselves about themselves.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781421415864"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1421415860"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=54&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Day_Commodus_Killed_a_Rhino.html?hl=&id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=o3SbBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "__F8xEX8uw8C", "etag": "h6WY9taqA/c", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/__F8xEX8uw8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws", "authors": ["Charles de Secondat baron de Montesquieu", "Cambridge texts in the history of political thought", "Charles de Montesquieu", "Montesquieu", "Charles de Secondat Montesquieu"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "1989-09-21", "description": "The Spirit of the Laws is without question one of the central texts in the history of eighteenth-century thought, yet there has been no complete scholarly English language edition since 1750.

His purview is the northern European bourgeoisie, principally in England and the Low Countries, from 1600 to 1900. And his particular interest is the relation of music to the human body. He argues that musical practices, invariably linked to the body, are inseparable from the prevailing discourses of power, knowledge, identity, desire, and sexuality. With the support of 100 illustrations, Leppert addresses music and the production of racism, the hoarding of musical sound in a culture of scarcity, musical consumption and the policing of gender, the domestic piano and misogyny, music and male anxiety, and the social silencing of music. His unexpected yoking of musicology and art history, in particular his original insights into the relationships between music, visual representation, and the history of the body, make exciting reading for scholars, students, and all those interested in society and the arts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0520917170"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780520917170"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 345, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrJb4caOn9QC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3254.36, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3254.36, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&rdid=book-rrJb4caOn9QC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3254360000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3254360000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Sight_of_Sound-sample-epub.acsm?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Sight_of_Sound-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "UZEfjUi1RyoC", "etag": "sD37/XBUKG4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/UZEfjUi1RyoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "History in the Digital Age", "authors": ["Toni Weller"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2013", "description": "The digital age is affecting all aspects of historical study, but much of the existing literature about history in the digital age can be alienating to the traditional historian who does not necessarily value or wish to embrace digital resources.

Day was the first to enter a 12x12 room where four terrorist leaders were waiting in ambush. When the gunfight was over, he took out all four terrorists in the room, but not before being shot twenty-seven times and hit with grenade shrapnel. Miraculously, Day cleared the rest of the house and rescued six women and children before walking out on his own to an awaiting helicopter, which flew him to safety. While in the hospital, the Navy SEAL lost fifty-five pounds in two weeks. It took almost two years for Day to physically recover from his injuries, although he still deals with pain.

On July 15, 1997, Gianni Versace was shot and killed on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan. But months before Versace\u2019s murder, award-winning journalist Maureen Orth was already investigating a major story on Cunanan for Vanity Fair. Culled from interviews with more than four hundred people and insights gleaned from thousands of pages of police reports, Vulgar Favors tells the complete story of Andrew Cunanan, his unwitting victims, and the moneyed world in which they lived . . . and died. Orth reveals how Cunanan met Versace, and why police and the FBI repeatedly failed to catch him. Here is a gripping odyssey that races across America\u2014from California\u2019s wealthy gay underworld to modest Midwestern homes of families mourning the loss of their sons to South Beach and its unapologetic decadence. Vulgar Favors is at once a masterwork of investigative journalism and a riveting account of a sociopath, his crimes, and the mysteries he left along the way. \u201cThe breadth and thoroughness of [Maureen] Orth\u2019s research are often staggering.\u201d\u2014The New York Times \u201cFascinating . . . ripe with chilling detail.\u201d\u2014Entertainment Weekly", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307766616"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307766618"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 560, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.8.8.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Vulgar_Favors.html?hl=&id=_jGKtjtLRPoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vulgar_Favors-sample-epub.acsm?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vulgar_Favors-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_jGKtjtLRPoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nWTH2Npul8MC", "etag": "Bxog81nc2C8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nWTH2Npul8MC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Black against Empire", "subtitle": "The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party", "authors": ["Joshua Bloom", "Waldo E.

Unlike the Civil Rights Movement that called for full citizenship rights for blacks within the U.S., the Black Panther Party rejected the legitimacy of the U.S. government and positioned itself as part of a global struggle against American imperialism. In the face of intense repression, the Party flourished, becoming the center of a revolutionary movement with offices in 68 U.S. cities and powerful allies around the world. Black against Empire is the first comprehensive overview and analysis of the history and politics of the Black Panther Party. The authors analyze key political questions, such as why so many young black people across the country risked their lives for the revolution, why the Party grew most rapidly during the height of repression, and why allies abandoned the Party at its peak of influence. Bold, engrossing, and richly detailed, this book cuts through the mythology and obfuscation, revealing the political dynamics that drove the explosive growth of this revolutionary movement, and its disastrous unraveling. Informed by twelve years of meticulous archival research, as well as familiarity with most of the former Party leadership and many rank-and-file members, this book is the definitive history of one of the greatest challenges ever posed to American state power.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780520953543"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0520953541"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 560, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nWTH2Npul8MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nWTH2Npul8MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nWTH2Npul8MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=64&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nWTH2Npul8MC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_against_Empire.html?hl=&id=nWTH2Npul8MC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Black_against_Empire-sample-epub.acsm?id=nWTH2Npul8MC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Black_against_Empire-sample-pdf.acsm?id=nWTH2Npul8MC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nWTH2Npul8MC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AWI8fmyhN5IC", "etag": "nPO+JxwPATc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AWI8fmyhN5IC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Empire of Liberty", "subtitle": "A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815", "authors": ["Gordon S. Wood"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2009-10-28", "description": "The Oxford History of the United States is by far the most respected multi-volume history of our nation. The series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, two New York Times bestsellers, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes. Now, in the newest volume in the series, one of America's most esteemed historians, Gordon S. Wood, offers a brilliant account of the early American Republic, ranging from 1789 and the beginning of the national government to the end of the War of 1812. As Wood reveals, the period was marked by tumultuous change in all aspects of American life--in politics, society, economy, and culture. The men who founded the new government had high hopes for the future, but few of their hopes and dreams worked out quite as they expected. They hated political parties but parties nonetheless emerged. Some wanted the United States to become a great fiscal-military state like those of Britain and France; others wanted the country to remain a rural agricultural state very different from the European states. Instead, by 1815 the United States became something neither group anticipated. Many leaders expected American culture to flourish and surpass that of Europe; instead it became popularized and vulgarized. The leaders also hope to see the end of slavery; instead, despite the release of many slaves and the end of slavery in the North, slavery was stronger in 1815 than it had been in 1789. Many wanted to avoid entanglements with Europe, but instead the country became involved in Europe's wars and ended up waging another war with the former mother country. Still, with a new generation emerging by 1815, most Americans were confident and optimistic about the future of their country.

For generations, the collective American consciousness has believed that the former ruined the country and the latter saved it. Endless praise has been heaped upon President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for masterfully reining in the Depression\u2019s destructive effects and propping up the country on his New Deal platform. In fact, FDR has achieved mythical status in American history and is considered to be, along with Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln, one of the greatest presidents of all time. But would the Great Depression have been so catastrophic had the New Deal never been implemented? In FDR\u2019s Folly, historian Jim Powell argues that it was in fact the New Deal itself, with its shortsighted programs, that deepened the Great Depression, swelled the federal government, and prevented the country from turning around quickly. You\u2019ll discover in alarming detail how FDR\u2019s federal programs hurt America more than helped it, with effects we still feel today, including: \u2022 How Social Security actually increased unemployment \u2022 How higher taxes undermined good businesses \u2022 How new labor laws threw people out of work \u2022 And much more This groundbreaking book pulls back the shroud of awe and the cloak of time enveloping FDR to prove convincingly how flawed his economic policies actually were, despite his good intentions and the astounding intellect of his circle of advisers.

By tracing constructions of \"Asian American\" to an interpenetrating dynamic between Asia and America, the author obtains a deeper understanding of key issues in American culture, history, and society. The formation of America in the twentieth century has had everything to do with \"westward expansion\" across the \"Pacific frontier\" and the movement of Asians onto American soil. After the passage of the last piece of anti-Asian legislation in the 1930's, the United States found it had to grapple with both the presence of Asians already in America and the imperative to develop its neocolonial interests in East Asia. The author argues that, under these double imperatives, a great wall between \"Asian\" and \"American\" is constructed precisely when the two threatened to merge. Yet the very incompleteness of American identity has allowed specific and contingent fusion of \"Asian\" and \"American\" at particular historical junctures. From the importation of Asian labor in the mid-nineteenth century, the territorialization of Hawaii and the Philippines in the late-nineteenth century, through wars with Japan, Korea, and Vietnam and the Cold War with China, to today's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation group, the United States in the modern age has seen its national identity as strongly attached to the Pacific. As this has taken place, so has the formation of a variety of Asian American identities. Each contains a specific notion of America and reveals a particular conception of \"Asian\" and \"American.\" Complicating the usual notion of \"identity politics\" and drawing on a wide range of writings\u0097sociological, historical, cultural, medical, anthropological, geographic, economic, journalistic, and political\u0097the author studies both how the formation of these identifications discloses the response of America to the presence of Asians and how Asian Americans themselves have inhabited these roles and resisted such categorizations, inventing their own particular subjectivities as Americans.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0804734453"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780804734455"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 504, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=myTsFvusht0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=myTsFvusht0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=myTsFvusht0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=myTsFvusht0C&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Asian_American.html?hl=&id=myTsFvusht0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=myTsFvusht0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "b912JnKpYTkC", "etag": "VQfUNOq4gko", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/b912JnKpYTkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "God's Playground A History of Poland", "subtitle": "Volume 1: The Origins to 1795", "authors": ["Norman Davies"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2005-02-24", "description": "This new edition of Norman Davies's classic study of the history of Poland has been revised and fully updated with two new chapters to bring the story to the end of the twentieth century.

Christopher Beckwith describes the rise and fall of the great Central Eurasian empires, including those of the Scythians, Attila the Hun, the Turks and Tibetans, and Genghis Khan and the Mongols. In addition, he explains why the heartland of Central Eurasia led the world economically, scientifically, and artistically for many centuries despite invasions by Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Chinese, and others. In retelling the story of the Old World from the perspective of Central Eurasia, Beckwith provides a new understanding of the internal and external dynamics of the Central Eurasian states and shows how their people repeatedly revolutionized Eurasian civilization. Beckwith recounts the Indo-Europeans' migration out of Central Eurasia, their mixture with local peoples, and the resulting development of the Graeco-Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations; he details the basis for the thriving economy of premodern Central Eurasia, the economy's disintegration following the region's partition by the Chinese and Russians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the damaging of Central Eurasian culture by Modernism; and he discusses the significance for world history of the partial reemergence of Central Eurasian nations after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Empires of the Silk Road places Central Eurasia within a world historical framework and demonstrates why the region is central to understanding the history of civilization.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0691135894"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780691135892"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 472, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.0.1.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5jG1eHe3y4EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5jG1eHe3y4EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5jG1eHe3y4EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5jG1eHe3y4EC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Empires_of_the_Silk_Road.html?hl=&id=5jG1eHe3y4EC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Empires_of_the_Silk_Road-sample-epub.acsm?id=5jG1eHe3y4EC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Empires_of_the_Silk_Road-sample-pdf.acsm?id=5jG1eHe3y4EC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5jG1eHe3y4EC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "E8jtTGB8VtUC", "etag": "xOyFRrtouZ0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/E8jtTGB8VtUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Present Pasts", "subtitle": "Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory", "authors": ["Andreas Huyssen"], "publisher": "Stanford University Press", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "This book analyzes the relation of public memory to history, forgetting, and selective memory in three late-twentieth-century cities that have confronted major social or political traumas\u2014Berlin, Buenos Aires, and New York.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0804745617"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780804745611"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 177, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E8jtTGB8VtUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E8jtTGB8VtUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E8jtTGB8VtUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=76&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E8jtTGB8VtUC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Present_Pasts.html?hl=&id=E8jtTGB8VtUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=E8jtTGB8VtUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "7jWaDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "GeibY1reUbw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7jWaDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Being Heumann", "subtitle": "An Unrepentant Memoir of a Disability Rights Activist", "authors": ["Judith Heumann", "Kristen Joiner"], "publisher": "Beacon Press", "publishedDate": "2020-02-25", "description": "One of the most influential disability rights activists in US history tells her personal story of fighting for the right to receive an education, have a job, and just be human.

Indeed, his vision of modern warfare powerfully influenced America's decision to rethink its military strategy in Iraq and implement \"the Surge,\" now recognized as a dramatic success. In The Accidental Guerrilla, Kilcullen provides a remarkably fresh perspective on the War on Terror. Kilcullen takes us \"on the ground\" to uncover the face of modern warfare, illuminating both the big global war (the \"War on Terrorism\") and its relation to the associated \"small wars\" across the globe: Iraq, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Thailand, the Pakistani tribal zones, East Timor and the horn of Africa. Kilcullen sees today's conflicts as a complex interweaving of contrasting trends--local insurgencies seeking autonomy caught up in a broader pan-Islamic campaign--small wars in the midst of a big one. He warns that America's actions in the war on terrorism have tended to conflate these trends, blurring the distinction between local and global struggles and thus enormously complicating our challenges. Indeed, the US had done a poor job of applying different tactics to these very different situations, continually misidentifying insurgents with limited aims and legitimate grievances--whom he calls \"accidental guerrillas\"--as part of a coordinated worldwide terror network. We must learn how to disentangle these strands, develop strategies that deal with global threats, avoid local conflicts where possible, and win them where necessary. Colored with gripping battlefield experiences that range from the jungles and highlands of Southeast Asia to the mountains of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to the dusty towns of the Middle East, The Accidental Guerrilla will, quite simply, change the way we think about war.

We know what life was like for Victoria and Albert. But what was it like for a commoner like you or me? How did it feel to cook with coal and wash with tea leaves? Drink beer for breakfast and clean your teeth with cuttlefish? Dress in whalebone and feed opium to the baby? Catch the omnibus to work and do the laundry in your corset? Surviving everyday life came down to the gritty details, the small necessities and tricks of living . . . How To Be A Victorian by Ruth Goodman is a radical new approach to history; a journey back in time more intimate, personal and physical than anything before. It is one told from the inside out - how our forebears interacted with the practicalities of their world - and it is a history of those things that make up the day-to-day reality of life, matters so small and seemingly mundane that people scarcely mention them in their diaries or letters. Moving through the rhythm of the day, from waking up to the sound of a knocker-upper man poking a stick at your window, to retiring for nocturnal activities, when the door finally closes on twenty four hours of life, this astonishing guide illuminates the overlapping worlds of health, sex, fashion, food, school, work and play. If you liked A Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England or 1000 Years of Annoying the French, you will love this book. Ruth Goodman is an independent scholar and historian, specialising in social and domestic history. She works with a wide range of museums and other academic institutions exploring the past of ordinary people and their activities. She has presented a number of BBC 2 television series, including Victorian Farm, Edwardian Farm and Wartime Farm. In each of these programs, she spent a year recreating life from a different period. As well as her involvement with the Farm series, Ruth makes frequent appearances on The One Show and Coast.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780241958346"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0241958342"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 12, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.6.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 600.62, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 300.31, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C&rdid=book-NS2GLjtFnC8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 600620000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 300310000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_to_be_a_Victorian-sample-epub.acsm?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NS2GLjtFnC8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "x2EBkPNnUXEC", "etag": "HLwz59Q2B0Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/x2EBkPNnUXEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Great Plague", "authors": ["Stephen Porter"], "publisher": "Amberley Publishing", "publishedDate": "2009-01", "description": "Offers a narrative history of the Great Plague which struck England in 1665-66.

The promiscuous use of drugs at the very highest levels also impaired and confused decision-making, with Hitler and his entourage taking refuge in potentially lethal cocktails of stimulants administered by the physician Dr Morell as the war turned against Germany.

Central to the very idea of America is the principle that we are a nation of opportunity. But over the last quarter century we have seen a disturbing \u201copportunity gap\u201d emerge. We Americans have always believed that those who have talent and try hard will succeed, but this central tenet of the American Dream seems no longer true or at the least, much less true than it was. In Our Kids, Robert Putnam offers a personal and authoritative look at this new American crisis, beginning with the example of his high school class of 1959 in Port Clinton, Ohio.

Early excavators uncovered a clay-lined shaft containing layers of soil interspersed with wooden platforms, but when they reached a depth of ninety feet, water poured into the shaft and made further digging impossible. Since then the mystery of Oak Island\u2019s \u201cMoney Pit\u201d has enthralled generations of treasure hunters, including a Boston insurance salesman whose obsession ruined him; young Franklin Delano Roosevelt; and film star Errol Flynn. Perplexing discoveries have ignited explorers\u2019 imaginations: a flat stone inscribed in code; a flood tunnel draining from a man-made beach; a torn scrap of parchment; stone markers forming a huge cross. Swaths of the island were bulldozed looking for answers; excavation attempts have claimed two lives. Theories abound as to what\u2019s hidden on Oak Island\u2014pirates\u2019 treasure, Marie Antoinette\u2019s lost jewels, the Holy Grail, proof that Sir Francis Bacon was the true author of Shakespeare\u2019s plays\u2014yet to this day, the Money Pit remains an enigma. The Curse of Oak Island is a fascinating account of the strange, rich history of the island and the intrepid treasure hunters who have driven themselves to financial ruin, psychotic breakdowns, and even death in pursuit of answers. And as Michigan brothers Marty and Rick Lagina become the latest to attempt to solve the mystery, as documented on the History Channel\u2019s television show The Curse of Oak Island, Sullivan takes readers along to follow their quest firsthand.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780802189059"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0802189059"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 396, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 2.5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Curse_of_Oak_Island.html?hl=&id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Curse_of_Oak_Island-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Curse_of_Oak_Island-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZAvADQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "JSccdOtgTboC", "etag": "M8c1BNIy2j0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JSccdOtgTboC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Art of Forgetting", "subtitle": "Disgrace & Oblivion in Roman Political Culture", "authors": ["Harriet I.

Written with exceptional clarity, Down to Earth re-envisions the story of America \"from the ground up.\" It reveals how focusing on plants, animals, climate, and other ecological factors can radically change the way that we think about the past. Examining such familiar topics as colonization, the industrial revolution, slavery, the Civil War, and the emergence of modern-day consumer culture, Steinberg recounts how the natural world influenced the course of human history. From the colonists' attempts to impose order on the land to modern efforts to sell the wilderness as a consumer good, the author reminds readers that many critical episodes in our history were, in fact, environmental events. He highlights the ways in which we have attempted to reshape and control nature, from Thomas Jefferson's surveying plan, which divided the national landscape into a grid, to the transformation of animals, crops, and even water into commodities. The text is ideal for courses in environmental history, environmental studies, urban studies, economic history, and American history. Passionately argued and thought-provoking, Down to Earth retells our nation's history with nature in the foreground--a perspective that will challenge our view of everything from Jamestown to Disney

Genocide, and the Making of a Continental Catastrophe", "authors": ["Gerard Prunier"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2008-12-31", "description": "The Rwandan genocide sparked a horrific bloodbath that swept across sub-Saharan Africa, ultimately leading to the deaths of some four million people. In this extraordinary history of the recent wars in Central Africa, Gerard Prunier offers a gripping account of how one grisly episode laid the groundwork for a sweeping and disastrous upheaval. Prunier vividly describes the grisly aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, when some two million refugees--a third of Rwanda's population--fled to exile in Zaire in 1996. The new Rwandan regime then crossed into Zaire and attacked the refugees, slaughtering upwards of 400,000 people. The Rwandan forces then turned on Zaire's despotic President Mobutu and, with the help of a number of allied African countries, overthrew him. But as Prunier shows, the collapse of the Mobutu regime and the ascension of the corrupt and erratic Laurent-D?sir? Kabila created a power vacuum that drew Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe, Sudan, and other African nations into an extended and chaotic war. The heart of the book documents how the whole core of the African continent became engulfed in an intractible and bloody conflict after 1998, a devastating war that only wound down following the assassination of Kabila in 2001. Prunier not only captures all this in his riveting narrative, but he also indicts the international community for its utter lack of interest in what was then the largest conflict in the world.

Using an investigative approach, this book presents the who, what, when, where, why, and how of dance history in relation to other arts and to historical, political, and social events. In so doing, this text provides a number of ways to create, perceive, and respond to the history of dance through integrated arts and technology. This study of dancers, dances, and dance works within an interactive arts, culture, and technology environment is supported by the National Standards in dance, arts education, social studies, and technology education. History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approachhas four parts. Part Iexplains the tools used to capture dance from the past. Part IIbegins a chronological study of dance, beginning with its origins and moving through ancient civilizations and the Middle Ages through the Renaissance. Part IIIcovers dance from the 17th to the 20th century, including dance at court, dance from court to theater, romantic to classical ballet, and dance in the United States. Part IVfocuses on 20th-century American dance, highlighting influences on American ballet and modern dance as it emerged, matured, and evolved during that century. History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approachincludes the following features: -Chapter outlines that present topics covered in each chapter -Opening scenarios to set the scene and introduce each time period -Explorations of dancers, choreographers, and other personalities -Explorations of the dances and significant choreography and dance literature of each time period -History Highlight boxes containing unusual facts, events, and details to bring history to life -History Trivia, providing insights into how dance relates to the history, art, and society of the time period -Web sites to encourage further exploration -Developing a Deeper Perspective sections that encourage students to use visual or aesthetic scanning, learn and perform period dances, observe and write performance reports, develop research projects and WebQuests (Internet-based research projects), and participate in other learning activities -Vocabulary terms at the end of each chapter Each chapter in parts II through IV provides an overview of the time period, including a time capsule and a historical and societal overview. Each chapter focuses on major dancers, choreographers, and personalities; dances of the period, including dance forms, dance designs, accompaniment, costuming, and performing spaces; and significant dance works and dance literature. The chapters also feature a series of eight experiential learning activities that help students dig deeper into the history of dance, dancers, and significant dance works and literature. These activities are presented as reproducible templates that include perceiving, creating, performing, writing, and presenting oral activities infused with technology. Teachers can use these activities as optional chapter assignments or as extended projects to help apply the information and to use technology and other integrated arts sources to make the history of dance more meaningful. History of Danceis an indispensable text for dance students who want to learn the history of dance and its relationship to other arts of the times using today's interactive technology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0736060359"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780736060356"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 309, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.4.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_Dance.html?hl=&id=_lLoTsT2X5EC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/History_of_Dance-sample-epub.acsm?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sGjSY0rRC_wC", "etag": "NZkcaS+xogU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sGjSY0rRC_wC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Copyrights and Copywrongs", "subtitle": "The Rise of Intellectual Property and how it Threatens Creativity", "authors": ["Siva Vaidhyanathan"], "publisher": "NYU Press", "publishedDate": "2003-04", "description": "Social movements inspired by powerful ideological beliefs continue to define global and national politics. In Yugoslavia, civil war is justified in the name of religion and ethnic identity. The Arab-Israeli conflict rages on, fuelled on either side by a conviction of indisputable ideological truth. Closer to home, American religious organizations consistently challenge political authority in the name of a higher morality. Existing theories either ignore the role of religion in social movement formation or discredit the claim that religious convictions can directly lead adherents to engage in political action. Through a detailed analysis of American and British evangelical Christians, J. Christopher Soper here demonstrates that religious commitments were, in fact, crucial in promoting political activism in both countries. Evangelical Christianity in the United States and Great Britain is the first book to provide such a comparative perspective. Focussing on the temperance movement and the politics of abortion, Soper highlights the similarities, and equally intriguing differences, between British and American political/evangelical structures. Using interviews and literature gathered from evangelical organizations on both sides of the Atlantic, he paints a fascinating picture of a hitherto neglected aspect of social movement theory. Evangelical Christianity in the United States and Great Britain is an invaluable new resource for scholars of religious studies, political science and sociology alike. Soper provides a unique model with which to view a dominant political trend: the mobilization of collective action groups around a set of powerful beliefs. His research can thus be applied beyond the boundaries of his chosen topic, and will be an important contribution to the study of any movement in which ideology assumes a significant role.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0814788076"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780814788073"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 255, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.0.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sGjSY0rRC_wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sGjSY0rRC_wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sGjSY0rRC_wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sGjSY0rRC_wC&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Copyrights_and_Copywrongs.html?hl=&id=sGjSY0rRC_wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Copyrights_and_Copywrongs-sample-epub.acsm?id=sGjSY0rRC_wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sGjSY0rRC_wC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Pfz638E6vOEC", "etag": "9mWIHxbPKKw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Pfz638E6vOEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Spanish Civil War: A Very Short Introduction", "authors": ["Helen Graham"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2005-03-24", "description": "This Very Short Introduction offers a powerfully-written explanation of the Spanish Civil war's complex origins and course, and explores its impact on a personal and international scale.

During this time, history writing itself became a battleground, and the book charts the Franco regime's attempt to appropriate the past.

Nicholas Fox Weber mixes psychoanalysis, art history, and the personal with an intricacy and spiritedness that Freud himself would have admired.\" \u2014John Banville, author of The Sea and The Blue Guitar \"This is an ingenious and fascinating reading of Freud's response to Signorelli's frescoes at Orvieto. It is also a meditation on Jewish identity, and on masculinity, memory, and the power of the image. It is filled with intelligence, wit, and clear-eyed analysis not only of the paintings themselves, but how we respond to them in all their startling sexuality and invigorating beauty.\" \u2014Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, author of Brooklyn and Nora Webster After a visit to the cathedral at Orvieto in Italy, Sigmund Freud deemed Luca Signorelli's frescoes the greatest artwork he'd ever encountered; yet, a year later, he couldn't recall the artist's name. When the name came back to him, the images he had so admired vanished from his mind's eye. This is known as the \"Signorelli parapraxis\" in the annals of Freudian psychoanalysis and is a famous example from Freud's own life of his principle of repressed memory. What was at the bottom of this? There have been many theories on the subject, but Nicholas Fox Weber is the first to study the actual Signorelli frescoes for clues. What Weber finds in these extraordinary Renaissance paintings provides unexpected insight into this famously confounding incident in Freud's biography. As he sounds the depths of Freud's feelings surrounding his masculinity and Jewish identity, Weber is drawn back into his own past, including his memories of an adolescent obsession with a much older woman. Freud's Trip to Orvieto is an intellectual mystery with a very personal, intimate dimension. Through rich illustrations, Weber evokes art's singular capacity to provoke, destabilize, and enchant us, as it did Freud, and awaken our deepest memories, fears, and desires. Nicholas Fox Weber is the director of the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and author of fourteen books, including biographies of Balthus and Le Corbusier. He has written for the New Yorker, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, Le Monde, ARTnews, Town & Country, and Vogue, among other publications.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781942658276"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1942658273"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JeChDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JeChDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JeChDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=99&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JeChDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Freud_s_Trip_to_Orvieto.html?hl=&id=JeChDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Freud_s_Trip_to_Orvieto-sample-epub.acsm?id=JeChDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Freud_s_Trip_to_Orvieto-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JeChDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JeChDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9y7nTpFcN3AC", "etag": "Ew301LJfU0I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9y7nTpFcN3AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Middle East Under Rome", "authors": ["Maurice Sartre"], "publisher": "Harvard University Press", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "The ancient Middle East was the theater of passionate interaction between Phoenicians, Aramaeans, Arabs, Jews, Greeks, and Romans. At the crossroads of the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian peninsula, the area dominated by what the Romans called Syria was at times a scene of violent confrontation, but more often one of peaceful interaction, of prosperous cultivation, energetic production, and commerce--a crucible of cultural, religious, and artistic innovations that profoundly determined the course of world history. Maurice Sartre has written a long overdue and comprehensive history of the Semitic Near East (modern Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel) from the eve of the Roman conquest to the end of the third century C.E. and the dramatic rise of Christianity. Sartre's broad yet finely detailed perspective takes in all aspects of this history, not just the political and military, but economic, social, cultural, and religious developments as well. He devotes particular attention to the history of the Jewish people, placing it within that of the whole Middle East. Drawing upon the full range of ancient sources, including literary texts, Greek, Latin, and Semitic inscriptions, and the most recent archaeological discoveries, The Middle East under Rome will be an indispensable resource for students and scholars.

As the field of fascist studies continues to integrate more fully into pan-European studies of the twentieth century, and given the increasing importance of secular \u2018political religion\u2019 as a taxonomic tool for understanding such revolutionary movements, this collection of essays considers the intersection between institutional Christian faiths, theology and congregations on the one hand, and fascist ideology on the other. In light of recent debates concerning the intersecting secularisation of religion and (usually Christian-based) the sacralisation of politics, \"Clerical Fascism\" in Interwar Europe approaches such conundrums from an alternative perspective: How, in Europe between the wars, did Christian clergy, laity and institutions respond to the rise of national fascist movements? In doing so, this volume provides case studies from the vast majority of European countries with analyses that are both original in intent and comprehensive in scope. In dealing with the relationship of various interwar fascist movements and their respective national religious institutions, this edited collection promises to significantly contribute to relevant academic historiographies; and as such, will appeal to a wide readership.

Snyder creates a theory of alliances by deductive reasoning about the international system, by integrating ideas from neorealism, coalition formation, bargaining, and game theory, and by empirical generalization from international history. Using cases from 1879 to 1914 to present a theory of alliance formation and management in a multipolar international system, he focuses particularly on three cases--Austria-Germany, Austria-Germany-Russia, and France-Russia--and examines twenty-two episodes of intra-alliance bargaining. Snyder develops the concept of the alliance security dilemma as a vehicle for examining influence relations between allies. He draws parallels between alliance and adversary bargaining and shows how the two intersect. He assesses the role of alliance norms and the interplay of concerts and alliances.His great achievement in Alliance Politics is to have crafted definitive scholarly insights in a way that is useful and interesting not only to the specialist in security affairs but also to any reasonably informed person trying to understand world affairs.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801484286"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801484285"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 414, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dlHcxUrjPB4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dlHcxUrjPB4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dlHcxUrjPB4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dlHcxUrjPB4C&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Alliance_Politics.html?hl=&id=dlHcxUrjPB4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Alliance_Politics-sample-epub.acsm?id=dlHcxUrjPB4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dlHcxUrjPB4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6VxkAQAAQBAJ", "etag": "hbaEGMab3wg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6VxkAQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The New Arrival: The Heartwarming True Story of a 1970s Trainee Nurse", "authors": ["Sarah Beeson"], "publisher": "Harper Collins", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27", "description": "\u2018I hadn\u2019t been in Hackney for 24 hours but I knew that the way I saw life and people had changed forever.

In both cultures physical beauty was highly admired, even to excess. What happened to those whose appearance did not conform to the 'ideal proportions'? The spectacular forms of dwarfism were always a focus of interest, and it is the most depicted disorder in antiquity. In this study Dr Dasen brings together for the first time a whole range of mostly unpublished or little-known iconographic, epigraphic, literary, and anthropological evidence. She covers areas such as the history of caricature and the portrait; medical history, in particular, the development of the perception of congenital disorders; social history; and history of religion, with questions on the magical and ritual efficiency of the malformed in sacred and theatrical contexts. She considers also the complex relations between mythology and ethnography, as shown, for example, in the Greek myth of the Pygmies.

Born in turmoil barely half a century ago, Pakistan seems to be in an interminable pursuit of its own identity and at the same time finds itself a pivotal player in world politics.

What we know of him comes exclusively from Roman historians who had every interest in minimizing his success, exaggerating his failures, and disparaging his character. The charges leveled against Hannibal include greed, cruelty and atrocity, sexual indulgence, and even cannibalism. But even these sources were forced to grudgingly admit to Hannibal's military genius, if only to make their eventual victory over him appear greater. Yet there is no doubt that Hannibal was the greatest Carthaginian general of the Second Punic War. When he did not defeat them outright, he fought to a standstill the best generals Rome produced, and he sustained his army in the field for sixteen long years without mutiny or desertion. Hannibal was a first-rate tactician, only a somewhat lesser strategist, and the greatest enemy Rome ever faced. When he at last met defeat at the hands of the Roman general Scipio, it was against an experienced officer who had to strengthen and reconfigure the Roman legion and invent mobile tactics in order to succeed. Even so, Scipio's victory at Zama was against an army that was a shadow of its former self. The battle could easily have gone the other way. If it had, the history of the West would have been changed in ways that can only be imagined. Richard A. Gabriel's brilliant new biography shows how Hannibal's genius nearly unseated the Roman Empire.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781597976862"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1597976865"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IJcT7R0dEe4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IJcT7R0dEe4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IJcT7R0dEe4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=118&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IJcT7R0dEe4C&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Hannibal.html?hl=&id=IJcT7R0dEe4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Hannibal-sample-epub.acsm?id=IJcT7R0dEe4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Hannibal-sample-pdf.acsm?id=IJcT7R0dEe4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IJcT7R0dEe4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "58MjDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "ANddi35b7vI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/58MjDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Energy and Civilization", "subtitle": "A History", "authors": ["Vaclav Smil"], "publisher": "MIT Press", "publishedDate": "2017-05-12", "description": "A comprehensive account of how energy has shaped society throughout history, from pre-agricultural foraging societies through today's fossil fuel\u2013driven civilization. \"I wait for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next 'Star Wars' movie. In his latest book, Energy and Civilization: A History, he goes deep and broad to explain how innovations in humans' ability to turn energy into heat, light, and motion have been a driving force behind our cultural and economic progress over the past 10,000 years. \u2014Bill Gates, Gates Notes, Best Books of the Year Energy is the only universal currency; it is necessary for getting anything done. The conversion of energy on Earth ranges from terra-forming forces of plate tectonics to cumulative erosive effects of raindrops. Life on Earth depends on the photosynthetic conversion of solar energy into plant biomass. Humans have come to rely on many more energy flows\u2014ranging from fossil fuels to photovoltaic generation of electricity\u2014for their civilized existence. In this monumental history, Vaclav Smil provides a comprehensive account of how energy has shaped society, from pre-agricultural foraging societies through today's fossil fuel\u2013driven civilization. Humans are the only species that can systematically harness energies outside their bodies, using the power of their intellect and an enormous variety of artifacts\u2014from the simplest tools to internal combustion engines and nuclear reactors. The epochal transition to fossil fuels affected everything: agriculture, industry, transportation, weapons, communication, economics, urbanization, quality of life, politics, and the environment. Smil describes humanity's energy eras in panoramic and interdisciplinary fashion, offering readers a magisterial overview. This book is an extensively updated and expanded version of Smil's Energy in World History (1994). Smil has incorporated an enormous amount of new material, reflecting the dramatic developments in energy studies over the last two decades and his own research over that time.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262338318"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262338319"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 568, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1761.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1761.82, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-58MjDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1761820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1761820000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Energy_and_Civilization-sample-epub.acsm?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Energy_and_Civilization-sample-pdf.acsm?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=58MjDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "526qA6ckcZ4C", "etag": "IXzHuNvlVbc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/526qA6ckcZ4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The History of Honduras", "authors": ["Thomas M.

Honduras has a rich heritage rooted in its cultural origins, including Mayan prehistory, Spanish conquest and rule, and Ch'orti' and Lencan indigenous ancestry. Unfortunately, Honduras is also one of the poorest nations in the world, with roughly half of its population living below the poverty line. Honduras has suffered both political trauma and natural disasters throughout its history. In 1969, Honduras' political tensions with El Salvador during a soccer series preliminary to the World Cup led to the four-day-long \"Football War.\" In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused billions of dollars of damage to Honduras; ten years later, half of the country's roadways were ruined, often beyond repair, by substantial flooding. Most recently, many countries have frowned upon the Honduran government's shift of power from the president to the head of Congress. The History of Honduras provides a comprehensive history of the small Latin American country, detailing Honduras's geography and current political systems with emphasis on its politics and cultural life. Recent coups and political controversy make Honduras an important Central American nation for today's students to study and understand. -- Publisher description.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780313363030"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "031336303X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=526qA6ckcZ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=526qA6ckcZ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=526qA6ckcZ4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:History&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=526qA6ckcZ4C&dq=subject:History&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_History_of_Honduras.html?hl=&id=526qA6ckcZ4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_History_of_Honduras-sample-epub.acsm?id=526qA6ckcZ4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_History_of_Honduras-sample-pdf.acsm?id=526qA6ckcZ4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=526qA6ckcZ4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
