With each major experimental and conceptual breakthrough, the classical, albeit essential, question has been asked \"are the immune systems of phylogenetically primitive vertebrates and invertebrates similar to that of mammals?\" Somewhat surprisingly for the jawed verte brates, the general answer has been a qualified form of \"yes\", whereas for agnathans and invertebrate phyla it has been \"no\" so far. The apparent abruptness in the appearance of the immune system of vertebrates is linked to the introduction of the somatic generation of the diversity of its antigen specific receptors. Therefore the questions regarding the origin and evolution of the specific immune system revolve around this phenomenon. With respect to the origin of the system (aside from the or igin of the rearranging machinery itself, the study of which is still in its infancy) one can ask questions about the cellular and mo lecular contexts in which the mechanism was introduced.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642596742"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642596746"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 326, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aWTvCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Origin_and_Evolution_of_the_Vertebrate_I-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "OKOAOPgBZpkC", "etag": "dqR4Y7ZcL+8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/OKOAOPgBZpkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Phenology: An Integrative Environmental Science", "authors": ["Mark Schwartz"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2003-10-31", "description": "Phenology is the study of plant and animal life cycle events, which are triggered by environmental changes, especially temperature. Wide ranges of phenomena are included, from first openings of leaf and flower buds, to insect hatchings and return of birds. Each one gives a ready measure of the environment as viewed by the associated organism. Thus, phenological events are ideal indicators of the impact of local and global changes in weather and climate on the earth's biosphere. Assessing our changing world is a complex task that requires close cooperation from experts in biology, climatology, ecology, geography, oceanography, remote sensing and other areas. This book is a synthesis of current phenological knowledge, designed as a primer on the field for global change and general scientists, students and interested members of the public. With contributions from a diverse group of over fifty phenological experts, covering data collection, current research, methods and applications, it demonstrates the accomplishments and potential of phenology as an integrative environmental science.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402015809"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1402015801"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 564, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OKOAOPgBZpkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OKOAOPgBZpkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OKOAOPgBZpkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OKOAOPgBZpkC&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Phenology_An_Integrative_Environmental_S.html?hl=&id=OKOAOPgBZpkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Phenology_An_Integrative_Environmental_S-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OKOAOPgBZpkC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OKOAOPgBZpkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "m1ifNnkAhAAC", "etag": "kyRahxPjKUY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/m1ifNnkAhAAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Marine Biodiversity of Costa Rica, Central America", "authors": ["Ingo S.

This is often forgotten, especially in tropical countries like Costa Rica, renowned for their rain forests and the multitude of life forms found therein. Thus this book focusing on marine diversity of Costa Rica is particularly welcome. How many marine species are there in Costa Rica? The authors report a total of 6,777 species, or 3. 5% of the world\u2019s total. Yet the vast majority of marine species have yet to be formally described. Recent estimates of the numbers of species on coral reefs range from 1\u20139 million, so that the true number of marine species in Costa Rica is certainly far higher. In some groups the numbers are likely to be vastly higher because to date they have been so little studied. Only one species of nematode is reported, despite the fact that it has been said that nematodes are the most diverse of all marine groups. In better studied groups such as mollusks and crustaceans, reported numbers are in the thousands, but even in these groups many species remain to be described. Indeed the task of describing marine species is daunting \u2013 if there really are about 9 million marine species and Costa Rica has 3. 5% of them, then the total number would be over 300,000. Clearly, so much remains to be done that new approaches are needed.

Since then, and particularly in this century, it has grown tremendously in its importance and in its intimate contacts with various other disciplines of science, some of which, like plant genetics and plant physiology, at one time indeed used to be included under the broad term botany. In spite of the fact that such subjects have expanded into major scientific fields of their own, botany, the mother science, continues to maintain its central place: this is because it deals with plants which constitute one of the most vital life-supporting systems of this planet. Furthermore, interacting and benefiting from advances made in other sciences, it has steadily progressed in a number of areas. Experimental embryology of vascular plants is one such field where spectacular advances have been made in recent years. The time is therefore particularly opportune for the publication of an authoritative book on the subject. It is very appropriate that the book has been planned and edited by Professor B. M. Johri, one of India's foremost botanists, whose contributions in embryology, plant morphology and morphogenesis are internationally known.

The book is based on the concept of a resource selection function (RSF), where this is a function of characteristics measured on resourceunits such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used. We argue that this concept leads to a unified theory for the analysis and interpretation of data on resource selection and can replace many ad hoc statistical methods that have been used in the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306481512"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306481510"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Resource_Selection_by_Animals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FweHI7uZ198C", "etag": "R5EX8xSG7Ks", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FweHI7uZ198C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Multicellular Animals", "subtitle": "The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa", "authors": ["Peter Ax"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2000-08-28", "description": "The system of multicellular animals presented here is an alternative to the traditional classification system.

Tony Soper's immaculate and engaging text remains the indispensible choice for the intrepid wildlife enthusiast. Antarctica's wildlife is under threat. The Southern Ocean is warming and the most obvious effect is on the continental ice shelves. Spectacular retreats and monster carvings from the west coast of the peninsula have been seen in recent decades. Less ice means fewer krill, which depend on the ice-edge for the algae which nourish them. In turn, this will impact on seal and whale numbers. In the case of penguins, while kings and macaronis, for instance, are doing well, the magnificently adapted and truly Antarctic species, Ad\u00e9lies and emperors, are in decline.

The literature on fossil rodents is widely scattered between journals on paleontology and mammalogy and in-house publications of museums and universities. Currently, there is no single source that offers ready access to the literature on a specific family of rodents and its fossil history. This work is presented as a reference text that can be useful to specialists in rodents (fossil or recent) as weIl as mammalian paleontologists working on whole faunas. Because the diversity of rodents in the world is essentially limitless, any monograph that included all fossil rodents would similarly be limitless. Hence, this book is limited to the re cord of Tertiary rodents of North America. The several species of South American (caviomorph) rodents that invaded North America near the end of the Tertiary are also not included in this text.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306446960"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306446962"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Tertiary_Record_of_Rodents_in_North.html?hl=&id=F4yxJ3M06TgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Tertiary_Record_of_Rodents_in_North-sample-pdf.acsm?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "G2mVCD7yjx4C", "etag": "kXffaMPingg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/G2mVCD7yjx4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Nomadic Desert Birds", "subtitle": "With 32 Tables", "authors": ["W.

Regrettably, the unsustainable use of plants and animals in traditional medicine is recognized as a threat to wildlife conservation, as a result of which discussions concerning the links between traditional medicine and biodiversity are becoming increasingly imperative, particularly in view of the fact that folk medicine is the primary source of health care for 80% of the world\u2019s population.

Yet, paradoxically, there are highly valued grain patterns including wavy and interlocked grain, whose origins in the cambium invite direct comparison with those of spiral grain, so that many authorities believe them to be related phenomena. In recent years this concept has prompted extensive research into the anatomy, genetics, and physiology of all such grain patterns in wood. As a result it has become apparent that tree cambia provide excellent systems through which to study the origins of stem polarity and the complex processes of morphogenetic control in plants. Beside these and other pressing topics for research, the book examines methods of measuring grain deviations, and considers their influence on wood properties, on the economics of timber production, and on wood manufacturing.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642737794"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "364273779X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 215, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-InvqCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Spiral_Grain_and_Wave_Phenomena_in_Wood-sample-pdf.acsm?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=InvqCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KEHTBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "VxrJlEok6dU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KEHTBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Complex Interactions in Lake Communities", "authors": ["Stephen R.

In its Ecology Program, one mode of initiating research is to en courage the development of new ideas through advisory workshops. The NSF is specifically directed to strengthen our nation's research potential. In addition, stimulating new approaches to research will continue to be prominent in the coming years as federal attention is given to increasing the innovativeness and competitiveness of the U. S. in science and engineering. A decision to initiate a workshop does not arise de novo in the Ecology Program. Rather, it emerges from panel discussions, conversations with in vestigators at meetings or on the phone, and from discussions between pro gram officers in the Division of Biotic Systems and Resources. This workshop was developed to provide advice to the NSF and the lim nological community. Some NSF perceptions on future funding for ecolog ical research on lake communities are presented here. Researchers often mentioned a paucity of innovative lake ecology at the community level. This perception was accompanied by a certain frustration since lakes probably have the best empirical data base of any natural environment and should continue to lead in the development of ecological concepts.

This present volume splendidly meets the need, and it is altogether fitting that Professor B. M. lohri, long an associate and close colleague of Professor Maheshwari and himself a prolific contributor to the subject, should have undertaken the task of editing it. When Maheshwari wrote, it was stiIl feasible for one author to handIe the subject, but today even someone with his fine bread th of vision and depth of understanding could not, alone, do it justice. So the effort has to be a collaborative one; and Professor lohri's achievement has been to bring together a team of authoritative collaborators, assign them their responsibilities, and put them to work to produce a text as integrated in its treatment as the diversity of the subject would allow.

It was a vaccine that enabled global eradication of the dreaded disease smallpox. Mass immunization of children forms the anchor of the strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) to attain \"health for all\" status by the year 2000. Vaccinology is undergoing a dimensional change with the advances that have taken place in immunology and genetic engineering. Vaccines that confer short or inadequate immunity or that have side effects are being replaced by better vaccines. New vaccines are being developed for a variety of maladies. Monoclonal antibodies and T cell clones have been employed to delineate the immunodeterminants on microbes, an approach elegantly complemented by computer graphics and molecular imaging techniques. Possibilities have opened for obtaining hitherto scarce antigens of parasites by the DNA recombinant route. Better appreciation of the idiotypic network has aroused research on anti idiotypic vaccines. Solid-phase synthesis of peptides is leading to an array of synthetic vaccines, an approach that is expected to attain its full potential once the sequences activating suppressor cells are discovered and the rules for presentation of antigens to T and B cells are better worked out. A new breed of vaccines is on the horizon that seeks to control fertility.

In the meantime, especially after publication of the second German edition in 1968, Dr. Konrad F. Springer and many colleagues, too, suggested that I should prepare an English version. Though this was the exact opposite of my original intention, I finally agreed despite the risks involved. Since 1968 our knowledge in Protozoology increased considerably. Though I tried to concentrate the text as much as possible, an enlargement of up to pages 554 was unavoidable. Many figures have been changed, replaced and added. Altogether their number increased from 422 to 437. In my opinion, it is only a matter of time before the \"true\" protozoologists dis appear. There will be cell biologists, biochemists, geneticists and others working with certain Protozoa, but very few who are interested in the group as a whole, their morphological and physiological diversity, their various types of reproduction and their relationships to other groups of organisms.

Yin"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "Physiologists have long been interested in the interaction, or coupling, between the heart and the vasculature. The early literature consists mainly of phenomenological descriptions of cardiac alterations resulting from specific interventions in the vasculature. Hundreds of studies, for example, describe functional aspects of hypertrophied myocardium associated with the excessive vascular loading produced by various types of experimental hypertension. Recently, the concepts of ventricular/vascular interaction have found important clinical application. The widespread use of vaso dilators and of intraaortic counterpUlsation balloons for unloading an ov erburdened, diseased heart is a prime example. Despite the interest in this field, until as recently as 20 years ago we were not able to describe ventricular or vascular function in a framework suitable for quantitatively expressing the interaction between these two complex systems. Three major developments-description of ventricular function in terms of both the time-varying elastance and the pump function graph and quantification of vascular function in terms of impedance have changed this. These functional descriptions now enable systems en gineers, bioengineers, physiologists, and clinicians to address very specific quantitative aspects of ventricular/vascular interaction and have resulted in a flurry of papers and symposia devoted to this subject.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461386346"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461386349"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 406, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_kfaBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ventricular_Vascular_Coupling-sample-epub.acsm?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ventricular_Vascular_Coupling-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QydKmhG3Ia4C", "etag": "h5LedrEE4YU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QydKmhG3Ia4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Comparative Genomics", "authors": ["Melody Clark"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2000-11-30", "description": "Comparative genomics: an introduction: sequencing projects and model organisms (M.

Some of the recent discoveries of the higher cognitive abilities of other mammals and also birds challenge the concept that primates are special and even the view that the cognitive ability of apes is more advanced than that of nonprimate mammals and birds. It is therefore timely to ask whether primates are, in fact, special and to do so from a broad range of perspectives. Divided into five sections this book deals with topics about higher cognition and how it is manifested in different species, and also considers aspects of brain structure that might be associated with complex behavior.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781441989130"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1441989137"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 386, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-K8W9BwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Comparative_Vertebrate_Cognition-sample-epub.acsm?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Comparative_Vertebrate_Cognition-sample-pdf.acsm?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=K8W9BwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Fo_Czy6aLKYC", "etag": "s0Oc+RvjgVs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Fo_Czy6aLKYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "New Directions in Lemur Studies", "authors": ["International Primatological Society.

Their mixture of regularity and irregularity is fascinating. A particular pattern seems to follow particular rules but these rules allow variations. No two shells are identical. The motionless patterns appear to be static, and, indeed, they consist of calci?ed material. However, as will be shown in this book, the underlying mechanism that generates this beauty is eminently dynamic. It has much in common with other dynamic systems that generate patterns, such as a wind-sand system that forms large dunes, or rain and erosion that form complex rami?ed river systems. On other shells the underlying mechanism has much in common with waves such as those commonly observed in the spread of an epidemic. A mollusk can only enlarge its shell at the shell margin. In most cases, only at this margin are new elements of the pigmentation pattern added. Therefore, the shell pattern preserves the record of a process that took place over time in a narrow zone at the growing edge. A certain point on the shell represents a certain moment in its history. Like a time machine one can go into the past or the future just by turning the shell back and forth. Having this complete historical record opens the possibility of decoding the generic principles behind this beauty.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540921424"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540921427"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 269, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3363, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3363, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC&rdid=book-X7Ju8FXQKEEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3363000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3363000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Algorithmic_Beauty_of_Sea_Shells-sample-pdf.acsm?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=X7Ju8FXQKEEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]}
