The first British Indian expedition, that of William Moorcroft in 1819-26, had never returned. Moorcroft's disappearance, like that of Livingstone or Franklin, posed a challenge in itself and preyed on the minds of his immediate successors. Heavily disguised and in an atmosphere of intense intrigue, Burnes and Dr James Gerard crossed the Afghan Hindu Kush in 1832 and approached the scenes of Moorcroft's discomfiture. They would both return; and \"Bukhara Burnes\" would become the most renowned explorer of his day. On the Roof of the World - John Wood In 1937 Alexander Burnes returned to Afghanistan on an official mission. Amongst his subordinates was a ship's lieutenant who, having surveyed the navigational potential of the river Indus, took off on a mid-winter excursion into the unknown Pamirs between China and Turkestan. Improbably, therefore, it was John Wood, a naval officer and the most unassuming of explorers, who became the first to climb into the hospitable mountain heartland of Central Asia and the first to follow to its source the great river Oxus (or Amu Darya.) Exploring Angkhor - Henri Mouhot Born in France, Mouhot spent most of his career in Russia as a teacher and then in the Channel Islands. A philologist by training, he also took up natual history and it was with the support of the Royal Zoological Society that in 1858 he set out for South East Asia. From Siam (Thailand) he penetrated Cambodia and Laos, where he died; but not before reaching unknown Angkhor and becoming the first to record and depict the most extensive and magnificent temple complex in the world. His discovery provided the inspiration for a succession of subsequent French expeditions up the Mekong. Over the Karakorams - Francis Edward Younghusband As leader of the 1904-5 British military expedition to Lhasa and as promoter of the early assaults on Mount Everest, Younghusband came to epitomize Himalayan endeavour. To the mountain he also owed his spiritual conversion from gung-ho solider to founder of the World Congress of Faiths. His initiation came in 1887 when, as the climax to journey from Peking across the Gobi desert, he determines to reach India over the unexplored Mustagh Pass in the Karakorams - \"the most difficult and dangerous achievement in these mountains so far\" (S.Hedin). Trials in Tibet - Ekai Kawaguchi By the 1890's the capital of \"forbidden\" Tibet, unseen by a foreigner since Huc's visit, represented the greatest challenge to exploration. Outright adventurers like the dreadful Henry Savage Landor competed with dedicated explorers like Sven Hedin, all succumbed to to a combination of official vigilance and physical hardship. The exception, and the winner in \"the race for Lhasa\", was a Buddhist monk from Japan whose expedition consisted of himself and two sheep. Ekai Kawaguchi was supposedly a pilgrim seeking religious texts. His faith was genuine and often tested, as during this 1900 excursion into western Tibet; but he is also thought to have been an agent of the British government in India.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472100030"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472100034"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 160, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Travel"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7&dq=Asia+Travel&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 125.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 125.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-CeSdBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 125080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 125080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Mammoth_Book_of_Travel_in_Dangerous-sample-epub.acsm?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CeSdBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "As we approached his town, a traveller informed us that the chief was anticipating <br>\nthe arrival of the Firingees (Europeans), whose approach had.

It explores the ethos of domestic travel and holiday-making in order to understand the distinctive common strands that underlie conventional and contemporary tourism practices, against the local and global backdrop.

Drawing from the extensive experience and global connections of intercultural consultant and international etiquette expert Sharon Schweitzer and consulting co-author and book strategist Liz Alexander, as well as contributions from over 100 international professionals, this crucial guide suggests that irrespective of their industry, everyone is in the relationship business. When doing business in Asia, building trust and gaining respect are vital steps in developing meaningful business relationships. Access to Asia is filled with the inside advice and real-world stories that explain how to strengthen business ties in ten countries including China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Myanmar/Burma, and South Korea. Access to Asia reveals why cultural awareness is so vital to sustained business success and outlines an eight-question framework for building business relationships in ten important Asian markets. The simple Self-Awareness Profiles prompt you to identify where you currently stand on topics related to this framework, compared with the prevailing country culture. The U.S. chapter offers insights for U.S. Americans into their own culture, and is a primer to doing business in the U.S. for Asian readers or indeed anyone from another culture. The authors include an alphabetical listing of common concepts and terms that offer a better understanding of how to create long-lasting business relationships in Asia. The book is filled with down-to-earth suggestions for creating goodwill such as incorporating the names of national heroes and sports figures in conversations and presentations.

Michael Hall", "Alan A. Lew"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2009-09-10", "description": "As one of the world\u2019s largest industries, tourism carries with it significant social, environmental, economic and political impacts. Although tourism can provide significant economic benefits for some destinations, the image of tourism as a benign and environmentally friendly industry has often been challenged. There is a clear and growing body of evidence that suggests that the effects of tourism development are far more complex than policy-makers usually suggest and that the impacts of tourism occur not just at the destination but at all stages of a tourist\u2019s trip. Furthermore, tourism does not exist in a vacuum. Broader social and environmental changes also shape the form, growth and experience of tourism development. This text provides a clear, accessible and up-to-date synthesis of tourism\u2019s role in our contemporary world, both as an agent of change, and as a response to it. Tourism-related change is approached from a framework that illustrates the changing environments in which they occur, including the spatial scale of such impacts and the effects of these impacts over time. This framework is then applied to the economic, socio-cultural and physical dimensions of tourism. After examining the different forms of tourism-related impacts, the book then discusses the role of planning as part of an integrated approach to the mitigation of undesirable impacts and the maximization of the desirable benefits of tourism development. Case studies and illustrations from a variety of locations from around the world are used throughout the book to exemplify key themes and issues; additionally figures and tables serve to elucidate statistical data. Understanding and Managing Tourism Impacts illustrates that when well managed tourism can make a positive contribution to destinations. The books use of issues of scale, time and form to illustrate the effects of tourism provide an accessible and significant reminder that tourism\u2019s impacts vary over time and space, affects both the visitor and the host community, and can be unpredictable in its consequences. Chapter objectives, recommended readings, and links to web-based material help students, practitioners and researchers to grasp the broader implications of tourism development in today's world.

At this party are fifty guests, all of whom live in or have traveled extensively through these countries. Among this eclectic and well-versed group of connoisseurs are authors of acclaimed guidebooks, popular newspaper columnists and pioneering adventurers. As the evening passes, they tell you tales from their lives in these exotic places. They whisper the names of their favorite shops and restaurants; they divulge the secret hideaways where they sneak off to for an afternoon (or a weekend) to unwind. Some make you laugh out loud, and others mesmerize you with their poetry and lyricism. Some are intent on educating, while others just want to entertain. Their attitudes are as unique as their personalities, but they are united in one thing ... their love of the region. If you can envision being welcomed at such a party, then you can envision the experience that this guidebook aspires to give you. Within these pages you will find tips for adventuring, eating, shopping, and sightseeing from savvy expatriates, seasoned travelers, and inspired locals. Unlike the typical guidebook, To Asia With Love does not offer a comprehensive overview, but instead presents selected recommendations in the form of personal essays and tidbits, each of which is paired with a practical fact file. Discover the benefits of carrying a baseball glove in Laos, go bird watching in the Thai everglades, take a motorbike into the Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia, and immerse yourself in modern art in Vietnam.

It is widely acknowledged that the current situation and trends in transport are not always sustainable in Asia, due in part to the fast-growing economy and the astounding speed of urbanization as well as least-mature governance. As essential research material, the book provides strong support for policy makers and planners by comprehensively covering three groups of strategies, characterized by the words \u201cavoid\u201d (e.g., urban form design and control of car ownership), \u201cshift\u201d (e.g., establishing comprehensive transportation systems and increasing public transportation systems for both intracity and intercity travel), and \u201cimprove\u201d (e.g., redesign of paratransit system, low-emission vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, and eco-life). These are elaborated in the book alongside consideration of the uncertainty of policy effects in the future. The book is also valuable for scholars and scientists because of the diverse methodologies presented and proposed herein. Among those are the four-step model with full feedback mechanisms, the bi-level programming model with sustainability goals, data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis approaches, structural equation models, discrete and/or continuous choice models, copula-based models, survival models, and driving risk models with short-term memory. Using data collected from more than ten Asian cities, including those in both developed and developing nations, the pathway to sustainable transport in Asia gradually becomes clear.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9784431543794"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "4431543791"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 292, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=Asia+Travel&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9428.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9428.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zYVEAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9428200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9428200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sustainable_Transport_Studies_in_Asia-sample-epub.acsm?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sustainable_Transport_Studies_in_Asia-sample-pdf.acsm?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zYVEAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "<b>Travel</b>.

Examining domestic and intra-regional tourism, the book reveals how improvements in infrastructures, ever increasing disposable incomes, liberalized economies, the inter-connectivities of globalization and the lowering of borders, both physical and political, are now enabling millions of Asians to travel as tourists. Drawing upon multidisciplinary theoretical perspectives and up-to-date empirical research, the twenty-three accessible essays in this volume indicate why a rigorous and critical study of Asian tourism must become integral to both our analysis of this rapidly transforming region and our interpretation of global tourism in the twenty first century.

This book advocates taking a business approach to tourism that encourages greater collaboration between stakeholders in the practical assessment of tourism options. The approach places key business management functions and stakeholders at the forefront of tourism initiatives. The business management functions of planning, organising, leadership and control are the filters through which tourism opportunities are viewed, while the stakeholder groups of customers, residents, industry and government set the agenda for appropriate tourism development. Tourist destinations must engage in realistic assessments of their abilities to meet the needs and expectations of tourism stakeholders and then act on these assessments so their goals and objectives can be achieved. A new model for bridging stakeholder gaps is presented as a template for how communities can understand and make the most of their tourism resources. The Bridging Tourism Gaps Model is a practical tool to help destinations focus on the important factors in developing and maintaining tourism as a beneficial and vital part of their communities.

Given the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in the region, there is a need for a comprehensive and readable overview of the critical debates and controversies in tourism in the region and the major factors that are affecting tourism development both now and in the foreseeable future. This Handbook provides a contemporary survey of the region and its continued growth and development as a key destination and generator of tourism, which is marked by a high proportion of intra-regional travel. The book is divided into five sections. This first section provides an introduction to the region and context to the nationally focused chapters. The next three sections are then broadly based on the three UNWTO Asian regions: South-East Asia, South and Central Asia, and East and North-East Asia, providing readers with a valuable snapshot of tourism at various scales, and from various approaches and positions. The concluding section considers future prospects for tourism in Asia. The handbook is interdisciplinary in coverage and is also international in scope through its authorship and content. It presents a range of perspectives and understanding of the processes and forces that are shaping tourism in this fascinating and dynamic region that is one of the focal points of global tourism. This is essential reading for students, researchers and academics interested in tourism in the growth region of Asia now and in the future.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781317665885"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1317665880"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 394, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Asia+Travel&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22420, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22420, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-7V0PDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22420000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22420000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Routledge_Handbook_of_Tourism_in_Asi-sample-epub.acsm?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Routledge_Handbook_of_Tourism_in_Asi-sample-pdf.acsm?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7V0PDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is essential reading for students, researchers and academics interested in tourism in the growth region of Asia now and in the future."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Yl_Qi1DUElkC", "etag": "Anv4QCcduEU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Yl_Qi1DUElkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Enter the Holy Spirit, Exit Me", "authors": ["Virginia S.

The book consists of 16 chapters presented in three parts. Part I introduces the reader to the issues and considerations of tourist destination governance. The four chapters in this part address the diversity of questions of relevance around regional destination development, community involvement, responsiveness and future outcomes of governance in the context of tourism. This includes an exploration of a variety of challenges regarding governance in emerging tourist destinations within the Greater Mekong in Asia, the conflicts in governance within a regional community in Scotland which has had a long history of golf tourism, the development of a typology of issues and pressures that affect tourist destination governance and the role of knowledge in good governance for tourist destinations. Part II explores the complexities and considerations of decision making and the significant role it plays in its specific relevance to tourist destination governance and tourism development within regional communities. In acknowledging that tourist destination development may involve contentious, complicated and arduous processes, this part recognizes that decision making has a prominent role to play in achieving effectiveness in governance. The three chapters in this part examine tourist destination decision making during times of crisis in Thailand, stakeholder roles in governance and decision making for a wildlife tour in Tonga, and the utilization of community involvement and empowerment as keys to success in regional tourist destinations. Part III provides further understanding regarding the approaches and solutions of tourist destination governance. This includes aspects of structural change, community engagement, networks and collaborations in the context of destinations. The five chapters in this part include the exploration of a process of governance change within a broader mountain tourist destination in Switzerland, utilizing effective networks as assistance to governance in destinations, community-based tourism governance solutions in a case study in Thailand and insights from complexity, network and stakeholder theories as approaches, including an understanding of a micro-macro context of tourist destination governance at its local/regional and national level. The concluding chapter examines the theory and methodology of governance studies, provide insights for tourist destination managers and researchers, and identify opportunities for further research into destination governance issues. This chapter discusses the application of governance concepts to other countries' governance and issues of conceptual importance, such as the need for ideology in the discussion of governance. This raises the question: does good governance of a tourist destination have to be based on democratic principles? Finally, the chapter looks at the concept of governance effectiveness.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781845937942"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1845937945"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vNGCp_WAyt0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vNGCp_WAyt0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vNGCp_WAyt0C&pg=PR13&dq=Asia+Travel&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vNGCp_WAyt0C&dq=Asia+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Tourist_Destination_Governance.html?hl=&id=vNGCp_WAyt0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vNGCp_WAyt0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This issue is of particular relevance for the Pacific <b>Asia Travel</b> Association (PATA)<br>\n2 as the Association works with both the private and public sectors in the travel <br>\nand tourism industry, and the issue of governance is becoming more important,&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HXYrAQAAQBAJ", "etag": "hxVOrWCgmG4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HXYrAQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Head First PMP", "subtitle": "A Brain-Friendly Guide to Passing the Project Management Professional Exam", "authors": ["Jennifer Greene", "Andrew Stellman"], "publisher": "\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"", "publishedDate": "2009-07-28", "description": "Learn the latest principles and certification objectives in The PMBOK Guide, Fourth Edition, in a unique and inspiring way with Head First PMP .

Einstein's lengthy itinerary consisted of stops in Hong Kong and Singapore, two brief stays in China, a six-week whirlwind lecture tour of Japan, a twelve-day tour of Palestine, and a three-week visit to Spain. This handsome edition makes available, for the first time, the complete journal that Einstein kept on this momentous journey. The telegraphic-style diary entries--quirky, succinct, and at times irreverent\u2014record Einstein's musings on science, philosophy, art, and politics, as well as his immediate impressions and broader thoughts on such events as his inaugural lecture at the future site of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a garden party hosted by the Japanese Empress, an audience with the King of Spain, and meetings with other prominent colleagues and statesmen. Entries also contain passages that reveal Einstein's stereotyping of members of various nations and raise questions about his attitudes on race. This beautiful edition features stunning facsimiles of the diary's pages, accompanied by an English translation, an extensive historical introduction, numerous illustrations, and annotations. Supplementary materials include letters, postcards, speeches, and articles, a map of the voyage, a chronology, a bibliography, and an index.

The first one in the Sikh Global Village series was Sikhs in Latin America published by Manohar. This volume covers Sikhs in Asia Pacific countries. The third will be on Sikhs in Europe. The Asia Pacific region is a vital and under-recognized home for the Sikh diaspora. Before 1947, most Sikhs migrated East. In addition to the commonly known destinations, the author also examines lesser known cases of Sikh migration to China, Korea, Japan and the Philippines. The book covers various aspects of the diaspora including the history of migration relating to the British Indian Army police force. The British gave preference in recruiting Sikhs, and encouraged them to build gurdwaras and supported them to keep their Sikh identity. Soon after arrival, these early immigrants encouraged their village compatriots and relatives to migrate in large numbers to avail of the various opportunities for gainful employment or business. Not only is this wave of migration important in its own right, but Sikh migration to North America finds its origins in the Asia-Pacific Sikh diaspora, specifically from Shanghai. The decolonization of Asian countries slowed down the migration and in some cases resulted even in exodus of Indians/Sikhs at the same time as new destinations to North America and UK opened up. Migration to each country has a unique profile, traced vividly in the book. Additionally the author has made an effort to outline the similarities and differences in migration of Sikhs to the East against present migration to the West.
