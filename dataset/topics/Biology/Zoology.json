With each major experimental and conceptual breakthrough, the classical, albeit essential, question has been asked \"are the immune systems of phylogenetically primitive vertebrates and invertebrates similar to that of mammals?\" Somewhat surprisingly for the jawed verte brates, the general answer has been a qualified form of \"yes\", whereas for agnathans and invertebrate phyla it has been \"no\" so far. The apparent abruptness in the appearance of the immune system of vertebrates is linked to the introduction of the somatic generation of the diversity of its antigen specific receptors. Therefore the questions regarding the origin and evolution of the specific immune system revolve around this phenomenon. With respect to the origin of the system (aside from the or igin of the rearranging machinery itself, the study of which is still in its infancy) one can ask questions about the cellular and mo lecular contexts in which the mechanism was introduced.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642596742"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642596746"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 326, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aWTvCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Origin_and_Evolution_of_the_Vertebrate_I-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aWTvCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "OKOAOPgBZpkC", "etag": "tOJLbWUcN4Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/OKOAOPgBZpkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Phenology: An Integrative Environmental Science", "authors": ["Mark Schwartz"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2003-10-31", "description": "Phenology is the study of plant and animal life cycle events, which are triggered by environmental changes, especially temperature.

Since then, and particularly in this century, it has grown tremendously in its importance and in its intimate contacts with various other disciplines of science, some of which, like plant genetics and plant physiology, at one time indeed used to be included under the broad term botany. In spite of the fact that such subjects have expanded into major scientific fields of their own, botany, the mother science, continues to maintain its central place: this is because it deals with plants which constitute one of the most vital life-supporting systems of this planet. Furthermore, interacting and benefiting from advances made in other sciences, it has steadily progressed in a number of areas. Experimental embryology of vascular plants is one such field where spectacular advances have been made in recent years. The time is therefore particularly opportune for the publication of an authoritative book on the subject. It is very appropriate that the book has been planned and edited by Professor B. M. Johri, one of India's foremost botanists, whose contributions in embryology, plant morphology and morphogenesis are internationally known.

Our intended audience is field ecologists in general and, in particular, wildlife and fisheries biologists who are attempting to measure the extent to which real animal populations are selective in their choice of food and habitat. As such, we have made no attempt to address those aspects of theoretical ecology that are concerned with how animals might choose their resources if they acted in an optimal manner. The book is based on the concept of a resource selection function (RSF), where this is a function of characteristics measured on resourceunits such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used. We argue that this concept leads to a unified theory for the analysis and interpretation of data on resource selection and can replace many ad hoc statistical methods that have been used in the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306481512"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306481510"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Resource_Selection_by_Animals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FweHI7uZ198C", "etag": "wMlhQreFzhE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FweHI7uZ198C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Multicellular Animals", "subtitle": "The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa", "authors": ["Peter Ax"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2000-08-28", "description": "The system of multicellular animals presented here is an alternative to the traditional classification system.

Less ice means fewer krill, which depend on the ice-edge for the algae which nourish them. In turn, this will impact on seal and whale numbers.

Many birds now hatch in managed nesting cover or in artificial nesting structures, use man-made wetlands, and winter on crowded refuges while consuming a grain diet The water they use is often limited in supply and may contain residues from its many prior users. Unfortunately, intensified management often results in new problems, among which disease is important There are many similarities between the current form of management used for some waterfowl and that used in domestic animals. In both, the objective is to maintain a healthy, productive population. Dealing with health problems in waterfowl will benefit from combining the skills of veterinary medicine and wildlife ecology. Revisiting this book after 15 years allowed me to consider changes at the interface between the two disciplines. Veterinary medicine traditionally has been concerned with the individual and with treating sick animals, while the ecologist is concerned with populations and the manager has limited interest in treating sick birds. During this period there has been a marked increase in awareness among veterinarians that they have a responsibility in wildlife and conservation biology. Curricula of many veterinary colleges now include material on non-domestic animals and attempt to put disease in an ecological context. Also during this time, waterfowl managers have become more aware of disease as a factor in population biology and there are early attempts to put numbers to \"disease\" in models of continental waterfowl populations.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461559511"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461559510"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 324, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5463.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5463.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-M9vcBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5463400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5463400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Diseases_of_Wild_Waterfowl-sample-epub.acsm?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Diseases_of_Wild_Waterfowl-sample-pdf.acsm?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=M9vcBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "F4yxJ3M06TgC", "etag": "Vrd8N3LMV2s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/F4yxJ3M06TgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Tertiary Record of Rodents in North America", "authors": ["William W.

The diversity of rodents is greater than that of any other order of mammals. Thus, it is not surprising that the fossil record of this order is extensive and fossil material of rodents from the Tertiary is known from all continents except Antarctica and Australia. The purpose of this book is to compile the published knowledge on fossil rodents from North America and present it in a way that is accessible to paleontologists and mammalogists interested in evolutionary studies of ro dents. The literature on fossil rodents is widely scattered between journals on paleontology and mammalogy and in-house publications of museums and universities. Currently, there is no single source that offers ready access to the literature on a specific family of rodents and its fossil history. This work is presented as a reference text that can be useful to specialists in rodents (fossil or recent) as weIl as mammalian paleontologists working on whole faunas. Because the diversity of rodents in the world is essentially limitless, any monograph that included all fossil rodents would similarly be limitless. Hence, this book is limited to the re cord of Tertiary rodents of North America. The several species of South American (caviomorph) rodents that invaded North America near the end of the Tertiary are also not included in this text.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306446960"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306446962"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=15&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Tertiary_Record_of_Rodents_in_North.html?hl=&id=F4yxJ3M06TgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Tertiary_Record_of_Rodents_in_North-sample-pdf.acsm?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=F4yxJ3M06TgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "G2mVCD7yjx4C", "etag": "prE13nJ80Rs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/G2mVCD7yjx4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Nomadic Desert Birds", "subtitle": "With 32 Tables", "authors": ["W.

The first involves withstanding the extreme conditions using behavioural or physiological tactics. The second strategy is to be a migrant and to opportunistically or seasonally move to where the necessary resources are. Nomadism, i.e. the opportunistic and irregular movements from resource-poor to resource-rich patches, is a tactic that birds, with their mobility, can use, and it is explored by W.R.J. Dean in this volume. For many bird species, such movements between habitats or across landscapes to find patches of resources are essential for their continued existence. The relationship between climate, habitat and movements in the avifauna of arid and semi-arid regions and the advantages and disadvantages of a seasonally migratory or opportunistically nomadic lifestyle are elucidated.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540403930"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540403937"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 185, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G2mVCD7yjx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G2mVCD7yjx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=G2mVCD7yjx4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=G2mVCD7yjx4C&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Nomadic_Desert_Birds.html?hl=&id=G2mVCD7yjx4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nomadic_Desert_Birds-sample-epub.acsm?id=G2mVCD7yjx4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nomadic_Desert_Birds-sample-pdf.acsm?id=G2mVCD7yjx4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=G2mVCD7yjx4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "1lHs8bTVh8oC", "etag": "8PqLArVb/1U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1lHs8bTVh8oC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Zoo Quest Expeditions", "subtitle": "Travels in Guyana, Indonesia, and Paraguay", "authors": ["David Attenborough"], "publisher": "James Clarke & Co.", "publishedDate": "1980", "description": "The author's account of journeys to Guyana, Indonesia and Paraguay in search of rare and bizarre creatures for the benefit of TV viewers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0718824652"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780718824655"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1lHs8bTVh8oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1lHs8bTVh8oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1lHs8bTVh8oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1lHs8bTVh8oC&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Zoo_Quest_Expeditions.html?hl=&id=1lHs8bTVh8oC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1lHs8bTVh8oC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "MDE5DwAAQBAJ", "etag": "S7lJvvskrgk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MDE5DwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecotourism\u2019s Promise and Peril", "subtitle": "A Biological Evaluation", "authors": ["Daniel T.

Readers will discover ecotourism\u2019s effects on biodiversity in connection with various industries that are habitat or taxonomically specific: fish tourism (including both freshwater and marine), marine mammal tourism, the huge industry centered on terrestrial animals, and the well-studied industry of penguin tourism. Given that the costs and benefits of ecotourism cannot be meaningfully assessed without understanding the human context, particular attention is given to how ecotourism has been used as part of community development. In closing, the book synthesizes the current state of knowledge regarding best practices for reducing human impacts on wildlife.

Ingredients derived from wild animals are not only widely used in traditional remedies, but are also increasingly valued as raw materials in the preparation of modern medicines. Regrettably, the unsustainable use of plants and animals in traditional medicine is recognized as a threat to wildlife conservation, as a result of which discussions concerning the links between traditional medicine and biodiversity are becoming increasingly imperative, particularly in view of the fact that folk medicine is the primary source of health care for 80% of the world\u2019s population.

It was a vaccine that enabled global eradication of the dreaded disease smallpox. Mass immunization of children forms the anchor of the strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) to attain \"health for all\" status by the year 2000. Vaccinology is undergoing a dimensional change with the advances that have taken place in immunology and genetic engineering. Vaccines that confer short or inadequate immunity or that have side effects are being replaced by better vaccines. New vaccines are being developed for a variety of maladies. Monoclonal antibodies and T cell clones have been employed to delineate the immunodeterminants on microbes, an approach elegantly complemented by computer graphics and molecular imaging techniques. Possibilities have opened for obtaining hitherto scarce antigens of parasites by the DNA recombinant route. Better appreciation of the idiotypic network has aroused research on anti idiotypic vaccines. Solid-phase synthesis of peptides is leading to an array of synthetic vaccines, an approach that is expected to attain its full potential once the sequences activating suppressor cells are discovered and the rules for presentation of antigens to T and B cells are better worked out. A new breed of vaccines is on the horizon that seeks to control fertility. Originally conceived to intercept a step in the reproductive process, they are conceptual models for developing approaches to regulate the body's internal processes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461392262"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461392268"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 342, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Veterinary_Vaccines-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Yi7jBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "iWJM1JUEQ3oC", "etag": "h59gUSFczSc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iWJM1JUEQ3oC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Honeybees of Africa", "authors": ["H.

The first is scientific: by virtue of a preference for certain large benthic invertebrates as food, sea otters have interesting and significant effects on the structure and dynamics of nearshore communities in the North Pacific. The second is political: be cause of the precarious status of the sea otter population in coastal California, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) announced, in June 1984, a proposal to establish a new population of sea otters at San Nicolas Island, off southern California. The proposal is based on the premise that risks of catastrophic losses of sea otters, due to large oil spills, are greatly reduced by distributing the population among two geographically separate locations. The federal laws of the U.S. require that USFWS publish an Environmental Impact Statement (ElS) regarding the proposed translocation of sea otters to San Nicolas Island. The EIS is intended to be an assessment of likely bio logical, social, and economic effects of the proposal. In final form, the EIS has an important role in the decision of federal management authority (in this case, the Secretary of the Interior of the U.S.) to accept or reject the proposal.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642728457"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642728456"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 247, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1vTuCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Community_Ecology_of_Sea_Otters-sample-pdf.acsm?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1vTuCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_pIcG_aZGjsC", "etag": "In7VQFbqU1Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_pIcG_aZGjsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecology of Java & Bali", "authors": ["Anthony J.

In the meantime, especially after publication of the second German edition in 1968, Dr. Konrad F. Springer and many colleagues, too, suggested that I should prepare an English version. Though this was the exact opposite of my original intention, I finally agreed despite the risks involved. Since 1968 our knowledge in Protozoology increased considerably. Though I tried to concentrate the text as much as possible, an enlargement of up to pages 554 was unavoidable. Many figures have been changed, replaced and added. Altogether their number increased from 422 to 437. In my opinion, it is only a matter of time before the \"true\" protozoologists dis appear. There will be cell biologists, biochemists, geneticists and others working with certain Protozoa, but very few who are interested in the group as a whole, their morphological and physiological diversity, their various types of reproduction and their relationships to other groups of organisms.

The early literature consists mainly of phenomenological descriptions of cardiac alterations resulting from specific interventions in the vasculature. Hundreds of studies, for example, describe functional aspects of hypertrophied myocardium associated with the excessive vascular loading produced by various types of experimental hypertension. Recently, the concepts of ventricular/vascular interaction have found important clinical application. The widespread use of vaso dilators and of intraaortic counterpUlsation balloons for unloading an ov erburdened, diseased heart is a prime example. Despite the interest in this field, until as recently as 20 years ago we were not able to describe ventricular or vascular function in a framework suitable for quantitatively expressing the interaction between these two complex systems. Three major developments-description of ventricular function in terms of both the time-varying elastance and the pump function graph and quantification of vascular function in terms of impedance have changed this. These functional descriptions now enable systems en gineers, bioengineers, physiologists, and clinicians to address very specific quantitative aspects of ventricular/vascular interaction and have resulted in a flurry of papers and symposia devoted to this subject.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461386346"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461386349"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 406, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_kfaBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ventricular_Vascular_Coupling-sample-epub.acsm?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ventricular_Vascular_Coupling-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_kfaBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "K8W9BwAAQBAJ", "etag": "JTA/dXduHLM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/K8W9BwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Comparative Vertebrate Cognition", "subtitle": "Are Primates Superior to Non-Primates?", "authors": ["Lesley J.

Their mixture of regularity and irregularity is fascinating. A particular pattern seems to follow particular rules but these rules allow variations. No two shells are identical. The motionless patterns appear to be static, and, indeed, they consist of calci?ed material. However, as will be shown in this book, the underlying mechanism that generates this beauty is eminently dynamic. It has much in common with other dynamic systems that generate patterns, such as a wind-sand system that forms large dunes, or rain and erosion that form complex rami?ed river systems. On other shells the underlying mechanism has much in common with waves such as those commonly observed in the spread of an epidemic. A mollusk can only enlarge its shell at the shell margin. In most cases, only at this margin are new elements of the pigmentation pattern added. Therefore, the shell pattern preserves the record of a process that took place over time in a narrow zone at the growing edge. A certain point on the shell represents a certain moment in its history.

In some modern classifications, they are classified as a subkingdom among the Protista (eukary otic single-celled organisms). Although they are not considered a formal cate gory by some taxonomists and some biologists consider the name inappropriate (inferring that they are the first unicellular animals, although some photosynthe size), it is still convenient to consider this group of organisms as an informal collection under the heading of protozoa. Their cosmopolitan distribution, sig nificant ecological role in mineral recycling and enhancement of carbon flow through lower trophic levels of food webs, and remarkable cellular adaptations to enhance survival in diverse environments make them significant organisms for biological investigation. In some cases, biologists are introduced to this group in first level courses or in invertebrate zoology, but never develop a full appreciation for the diverse and biologically sophisticated characteristics of these organisms. This book is intended as a survey of broad concepts in protozoan biology with an emphasis on comparative data. The focus is on the zoological aspects of the group. Topics more closely related to plantlike characteristics, as presented in books on phycol ogy, are not considered in detail here.

Therefore it is obvious that humans must develop new methods to face these dangers. Thus parasitological knowledge increases daily and must be formulated to be accessible for as many parasitologists (veterinarians, physicians, biologists) as possible.

Generations of researchers have investigated one of the last remaining evolutionary paradoxes: why sex exists at all. Given that sexual reproduction is costly from an evolutionary point of view, one could wonder why not all animals and plants reproduce asexually. Dozens of contemporary hypotheses attempt to explain the prevalence of sex and its advantages and predict the early extinction of fully asexual lineages. The major theme of this book is: what is the fate of animal and plant groups in which sex is lost? Initial chapters discuss theory behind asexual life: what major disadvantages do asexual groups have to face, what are the genetic and ecological consequences and what does this theory predict for more applied aspects of asexual life, for example in agricultural pests, diseases as well as in cultural crops such as grapes. Cases studies in many animals (focusing on both invertebrates and vertebrates) and plants reveal parallel, but also singularly novel adaptations to the absence of meiosis and syngamy. And last but not least, are asexuals really doomed to early extinction or do genuine ancient asexuals exist? This book assembles contributions from the most important research groups dealing with asexual evolution in eukaryotes. It is a milestone in research on parthenogenesis and will be useful to undergraduate as well as graduate students and to senior researchers in all fields of evolutionary biology, as the paradox of sex remains its queen of problems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "904812770X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789048127702"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 615, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 18054, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 18054, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&rdid=book-GaWD_OtE0AMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18054000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18054000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lost_Sex-sample-epub.acsm?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lost_Sex-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "IhLZDgAAQBAJ", "etag": "lDvxJku6A/s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IhLZDgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Evolution of Flight", "authors": ["Georg Glaeser", "Hannes F.

It critically and comprehensively discusses strain selection, growth characteristics, large-scale culturing, and biomass harvesting, focusing on the screening and production of high-value products from algae, and evaluating carbon dioxide sequestration from fuel gas as a climate change mitigation strategy. The latter areas of research are clearly central to the sustainable development approach that is currently attracting global attention. Over the decades, much of the literature on has focused on the biological and ecological aspects of phytoplankton found in freshwater, marine and brackish water environments. However, these organisms are known to also inhabit various other environments. More recently, there has been a substantial shift toward the concept of sustainable development and the \u201cgreen economy\u201d with emphasis on exploiting biological systems for the benefit of mankind. The significance of these plankton cannot be underestimated as they contribute approximately 40% of the oxygen in the atmosphere. Therefore, there is potential for exploitation of this invaluable biomass source that could lead to significant environmental and economic benefits for man. Providing a comprehensive outline of the most recent developments and advances in the field of industrial applications of these plankton, this book is an excellent reference resource for researchers and practitioners.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789811079382"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9811079382"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-JS5mDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basic_and_Applied_Phytoplankton_Biology-sample-epub.acsm?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basic_and_Applied_Phytoplankton_Biology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JS5mDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "eiDrCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "7oDhCpEiCAQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eiDrCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Behavioural Adaptations of Desert Animals", "authors": ["Giovanni Costa"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "After a brief survey of biotopic and vegetational features and an account of the main groups of desert animals, the most unusual patterns of the behaviour of the xerophilous fauna are examined.

One species, the rice brown planthopper, is among the most economically important pests in Asia. In past decades, government policies encouraged the control of rice planthoppers with synthetic pesticides, a tactic which promoted insecticide resistance and often led to the pesticide-induced resurgence of pest populations. To deter planthopper outbreaks, a more ecologically sound management strategy is being implemented, one based on a thorough investigation of population dynamics, natural enemies, and the genetics of host plant and insecticide adaptation. In the natural habitats of North America and Europe, scientists have also used planthoppers as model organisms to test ecological and evolutionary theory. The consequence of these diverse studies is an extremely scattered literature on planthoppers that has never been synthesized from an ecological perspective. This volume summarizes what is known about planthopper ecology and biological control. It takes a theoretical approach yet is deeply concerned with the application of theory to the practical problems of pest management.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461523956"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461523958"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 799, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-N7X4BwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Planthoppers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8VoeDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "jNqp18req/M", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8VoeDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Animal Ethics in the Age of Humans", "subtitle": "Blurring boundaries in human-animal relationships", "authors": ["Bernice Bovenkerk", "Jozef Keulartz"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2016-09-21", "description": "This book provides reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries that characterize the human-animal relationship. In the Anthropocene humans and animals have come closer together and this asks for rethinking old divisions. Firstly, new scientific insights and technological advances lead to a blurring of the boundaries between animals and humans. Secondly, our increasing influence on nature leads to a rethinking of the old distinction between individual animal ethics and collectivist environmental ethics. Thirdly, ongoing urbanization and destruction of animal habitats leads to a blurring between the categories of wild and domesticated animals. Finally, globalization and global climate change have led to the fragmentation of natural habitats, blurring the old distinction between in situ and ex situ conservation. In this book, researchers at the cutting edge of their fields systematically examine the broad field of human-animal relations, dealing with wild, liminal, and domestic animals, with conservation, and zoos, and with technologies such as biomimicry. This book is timely in that it explores the new directions in which our thinking about the human-animal relationship are developing. While the target audience primarily consists of animal studies scholars, coming from a wide range of disciplines including philosophy, sociology, psychology, ethology, literature, and film studies, many of the topics that are discussed have relevance beyond a purely theoretical one; as such the book also aims to inspire for example biologists, conservationists, and zoo keepers to reflect on their relationship with animals.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319442068"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319442066"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 414, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-8VoeDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Animal_Ethics_in_the_Age_of_Humans-sample-epub.acsm?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Animal_Ethics_in_the_Age_of_Humans-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8VoeDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Q57WCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "tng9slIZZ/Q", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Q57WCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Marine Ecological Processes", "authors": ["Ivan Valiela"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2016-03-22", "description": "The oceans represent a vast, complex and poorly understood ecosystem.

We acknowledge also the sacrifice of some who presented results of original research and have thus suffered a longer time than usual to publication. The timing of publication however has provided the opportunity to highlight recent discussions and resolutions made within the Antarctic Treaty forum to protect wildlife against disease and to include responses by Government and non-Government operators in Antarctica. These developments mostly followed from the Workshop on Diseases of Antarctic Wildlife. The book comprises 17 chapters presented in two parts. Wildlife disease consists of reviews, case studies and health assessments, and External factors covers the environmental, administrative and legal aspects. Each chapter is complete and c- tains all references. Six important documents are provided as Appendices. These present methods, reviews and other documents which are referred to in one or more chapters but are not readily available.

Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution summarizes the multi-faceted discoveries about organisms in nature that have stemmed from analyses of genetic markers provided by polymorphic proteins and DNAs. The first part of the book introduces rationales for the use of molecular markers, provides a history of molecular phylogenetics, and describes a wide variety of laboratory methods and interpretative tools in the field. The second and major portion of the book provides a cornucopia of biological applications for molecular markers, organized along a scale from micro-evolutionary topics (such as forensics, parentage, kinship, population structure, and intra-specific phylogeny) to macro-evolutionary themes (including species relationships and the deeper phylogenetic structure in the tree of life). Unlike most prior books in molecular evolution, the focus is on organismal natural history and evolution, with the macromolecules being the means rather than the ends of scientific inquiry. Written as an intellectual stimulus for the advanced undergraduate, graduate student, or the practicing biologist desiring a wellspring of research ideas at the interface of molecular and organismal biology, this book presents material in a manner that is both technically straightforward, yet rich with concepts and with empirical examples from the world of nature.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461523819"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461523818"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 511, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-MirnBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Molecular_Markers_Natural_History_and_Ev-sample-pdf.acsm?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MirnBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_gnaBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "XHkb3Y9BFTo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_gnaBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Insectivora", "subtitle": "With a Stereotaxic Atlas of the Hedgehog Brain", "authors": ["Heinz Stephan", "Georg Baron", "Heiko D.

The importance of Insectivora lies above all in the fact that, (1) insectivore-like ancestors are regarded as the initial group for the evolution of higher mammals, and (2) the insectivore brains retained many conservative traits, though the animals have adapted to different living environments. Therefore, the study of Insectivora brains enables an insight into the size and composition of the brain structure of earlier ancestors of the higher mammals including primates and humans; in addition, it illumi nates the various evolutionary trends which made the successful adaptation to different biotopes possible. The alterations which the brain has experienced in the course of the phylo geny and the related adaptive radiation will be examined in the succeeding volumes on the brains of other Eutheria, e.g., bats (Volume 2) and primates (Volume 4). In Volume 3 the brains of marsupials will be compared with those of conservative and evolved Eutheria.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461391241"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461391245"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 573, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_gnaBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Insectivora-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_gnaBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "IS5mDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "W3og6gDnIUk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IS5mDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Basic and Applied Zooplankton Biology", "authors": ["Perumal Santhanam", "Ajima Begum", "Perumal Pachiappan"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2018-07-23", "description": "The coastal and ocean ecosystem is a significant feature of our planet and provides a source of food for much of life on Earth. Millions of species have been, and are still being discovered in the world\u2019s oceans. Among these zooplankton serve as secondary producers and are significant as they form pelagic food links and act as indicators of water masses. They constitute the largest and most reliable source of protein for most of the ocean\u2019s fishes. As such, their absence or depletion often affects fishery. In many countries, the decline in fishery has been attributed to reduced plankton populations. Furthermore, trillions of tiny copepods produce countless faecal pellets contributing greatly to the marine snow and therefore accelerating the flow of nutrients and minerals from the surface waters to the seabed. They are phylogenetically highly successful groups in terms of phylogenetic age, number of living species and success of adaptive radiation. A study of the basic and applied aspects of zooplankton would provide an index of the fishery potential and applications, offering insights into ocean ecology to safeguard food supplies and livelihoods of the millions of people living in coastal areas. For this reason, we need to understand all the facets of zooplankton as well as their interactions with atmosphere and other life forms, including human. In this context, this book discusses the basic and applied aspects of zooplankton, especially taxonomy, mosquitocidal activity, culture, analysis of nutritional, pigments and enzyme profile, preservation of copepods eggs, bioenrichment of zooplankton and application of zooplankton in sustainable aquaculture production, focusing on novel biofloc-copefloc technologies, and the impact of acidification and microplastics on zooplankton. Offering a comprehensive overview of the current issues and developments in the field of environmental and commercial applications, this book is a valuable resource for researchers, aquaculturists, environmental mangers wanting to understand the importance of zooplankton and develop technologies for the sustainable production of fish and other commodities to provide food and livelihoods for mankind.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789811079535"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9811079536"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 442, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=57&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-IS5mDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basic_and_Applied_Zooplankton_Biology-sample-epub.acsm?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Basic_and_Applied_Zooplankton_Biology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IS5mDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "mIcHCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "wwOFJizpbOo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mIcHCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Behavior of Marine Animals", "subtitle": "Current Perspectives in Research", "authors": ["Howard E.

From the outset we decided not to limit the subject matter to behavior but to also include natural history. Much of what is known about the behavior of whales arose from studies whose principal aim was not behavior, much as it did for other animal groups before behavior was considered a distinct discipline. Thus in many of the articles behavior is closely intertwined with natural history and in others is completely overshadowed by a basic natural history approach. Our aim was to have the articles contain a review of the literature and include research findings not previously published. For all intents and purposes this aim has been realized, albeit perhaps not in as balanced a fashion in terms of species or subject matter as was originally planned. Nevertheless, we believe the articles present a wide range of informative works with a myriad of approaches and techniques represented. We are grateful to the contributors for their patience and understanding in awaiting publication, which has taken much longer than we originally expected.

But behind all the hyperbole lie real challenges related to dealing with the increasing incidence of emerging zoonotic disease events, the majority of which are thought to originate in wildlife (Jones et al. 2008). There are also many important diseases of domestic livestock which also occur in wildlife (e. g. foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever in wild boar, bovine tuberculosis in deer, badgers or possums), some of which can have a devastating impact on the farming industry, the wider rural economy and ultimately the public purse. But we should also not forget that wildlife diseases may have serious implications for the conservation of biodiversity. For some of the rarest, most endangered species (such as the Ethiopian wolf) d- ease may pose the greatest threat to their survival. If we are to avoid or reduce these impacts then we must improve our ability to detect and manage the risks associated with disease in wildlife populations. This is a challenge that will require expertise from many different disciplines: veterinary, ecological, medical, economic, poli- cal and zoological. In such an interdisciplinary field it is difficult to stay up to date with contemporary ideas and with techniques that may be rapidly evolving.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9784431771340"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "4431771344"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 284, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aX7wooaYAscC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aX7wooaYAscC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aX7wooaYAscC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aX7wooaYAscC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aX7wooaYAscC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aX7wooaYAscC&rdid=book-aX7wooaYAscC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Management_of_Disease_in_Wild_Mammals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aX7wooaYAscC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aX7wooaYAscC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sxInWntmk0QC", "etag": "ohe5zQxLId8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sxInWntmk0QC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Manual of Practical Zoology: Chordates", "authors": ["P.S.Verma"], "publisher": "S.

The overall goal of each contribution is to integrate newly collected field data with theoretical perspectives drawn from evolutionary biology, socioecology, biological anthropology, and conservation to identify how our current knowledge of primate behavior and ecology has moved beyond more traditional approaches. A corollary to this, and an important goal of the volume is to identify geographical regions and species for which we continue to lack sufficient information, to develop action plans for future research, and to identify areas for immediate conservation action. Despite many decades of primate research in Mesoamerica, much is still unknown concerning the basic ecology and behavior of these species, demography, current distribution, and conservation status of local populations, and the effectiveness of conservation policies on primate survivorship. Four major areas of research are the focus of the volume: Evolutionary Biology and Biogeography; Population Demography and Ecology; Behavior; and Conservation and Management Policies.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780387258720"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0387258728"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 600, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aifIuMsoYyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aifIuMsoYyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aifIuMsoYyQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aifIuMsoYyQC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aifIuMsoYyQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 21004, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 21004, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aifIuMsoYyQC&rdid=book-aifIuMsoYyQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 21004000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 21004000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/New_Perspectives_in_the_Study_of_Mesoame-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aifIuMsoYyQC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aifIuMsoYyQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WzoLBgAAQBAJ", "etag": "h3vSWTA7+HU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WzoLBgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Color Atlas of Surgical Anatomy for Esophageal Cancer", "authors": ["Tatsuo Sato", "Toshifumi Iizuka"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "It is essential to know all of the intricate lymph pathways when performing surgery for esophageal cancer in order to determine the extent of lymph node metastasis. Professor Sato has undertaken, at the request of the TNM Research Committee of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus, to map out and classify the lymph nodes of the mediastinum and neck. The beautiful artwork in the Color Atlas of Surgical Anatomy for Esophageal Cancer edited by Professor Sato gives an excellent understanding of the lymph node pathways and their importance in surgical treatment. Minute dissections which represent real life situations, not just the superficial pathways, show the precise location and topographical arrangement of the lymphatics. Full-color schematics are given with the actual dissection illustrations and photographs. The atlas clearly presents the classification of four significant pathways and their communication, the relationship of these pathways en route to the venous angles and the definition and assessment of the most critical nodes. Thoracic surgeons especially will benefit from the excellent illustrations of surgical techniques and the methods for recording the dissected lymph nodes which are presented by Professor Kakegawa. Leading experts fighting esophageal cancer with surgical treatment can use the classification in this outstanding atlas for many years to come as a standard for international comparison. The careful dissection of the lymph nodes may be the best way to improve survival rates after surgery for cancer of the thoracic esophagus.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9784431681984"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "4431681981"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 135, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WzoLBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Color_Atlas_of_Surgical_Anatomy_for_Esop-sample-epub.acsm?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Color_Atlas_of_Surgical_Anatomy_for_Esop-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WzoLBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "n97sOVn9iH8C", "etag": "/SSVFNid7Lo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/n97sOVn9iH8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Introduction to Animal Cytogenetics", "authors": ["H.C.

"authors": ["Enrique Murgui", "Marcus Hedblom"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2017-02-10", "description": "This book provides syntheses of ecological theories and overarching patterns of urban bird ecology that have only recently become available. The numerous habitats represented in this book ranges from rows of trees in wooded alleys, to wastelands and remnants of natural habitats encapsulated in the urban matrix. Authored by leading scientists in this emergent field, the chapters explore how the characteristics of the habitat in urban environments influence bird communities and populations at multiple levels of ecological organization and at different spatial and temporal scales, and how this information should be incorporated in urban planning to achieve an effective conservation of bird fauna in urban environments. Birds are among the most conspicuous and fascinating residents of urban neighborhoods and provide urban citizens with everyday wildlife contact all over the world. However, present urbanization trends are rapidly depleting their habitats, and thus knowledge of urban bird ecology is urgently needed if birds are to thrive in cities. The book is unique in its inclusion of examples from all continents (except Antarctica) in an effort to arrive at a more holistic perspective. Among other issues, the individual chapters address the censusing of birds in urban green spaces; the relationship between bird communities and the structure of urban green spaces; the role of exotic plant species as food sources for urban bird fauna; the influence of artificial light and pollutants on bird fauna; trends in long-term urban bird research, and transdisciplinary studies on bird sounds and their effects on humans. Several chapters investigate how our current knowledge of the ecology of urban bird fauna should be applied in order to achieve better management of urban habitats so as to achieve conservation of species or even increase species diversity. The book also provides a forward-looking summary on potential research directions. As such, it provides a valuable resource for urban ecologists, urban ecology students, landscape architects, city planners, decision makers and anyone with an interest in urban ornithology and bird conservation. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview for researchers in the fields of ecology and conservation of urban bird fauna.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319433141"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319433148"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 525, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15222, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-EgobDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15222000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ecology_and_Conservation_of_Birds_in_Urb-sample-epub.acsm?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ecology_and_Conservation_of_Birds_in_Urb-sample-pdf.acsm?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EgobDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QyX7CAAAQBAJ", "etag": "9Aq11LL6mUk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QyX7CAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Antarctic Nutrient Cycles and Food Webs", "authors": ["W.R.

Why do people commonly make metaphorical comparisons between human beings or social groups and animals, and to what degree are people's attitudes and beliefs about animals parallel to or contingent upon their attitudes and beliefs about human beings and human society? This collection of articles considers these issues. The issues are basic in any study of \"totemism,\" or human and animal relationships, and they have been discussed in anthropological literature since the time of Lewis Henry Morgan's work on Iroquois social organization. The contributors to this anthology have not limited themselves to the notion that clans and moieties are the only sources and objects of metaphorical comparisons between humans and animals. They suggest a shift in perspective that has metaphorical comparisons generated by conceived similarities and differences between animals and particular types of human beings. Some examples of this include macaw fledglings as adolescents; pumas as fully initiated men, and foxes as young married men. With this shift of emphasis, a significantly different analytic focus in the study of human-animal relations is produced.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0874802059"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780874802054"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 327, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g6T3n59hyAgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g6T3n59hyAgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g6T3n59hyAgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g6T3n59hyAgC&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Animal_Myths_and_Metaphors_in_South_Amer.html?hl=&id=g6T3n59hyAgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=g6T3n59hyAgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "zGTEicPYW_cC", "etag": "i1SyGPA3ejI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zGTEicPYW_cC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Societies of Wolves and Free-ranging Dogs", "authors": ["Stephen Spotte"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15", "description": "The first comprehensive assessment of societies of gray wolves and free-ranging dogs, with an emphasis on behavioral ecology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781107015197"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1107015197"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 377, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zGTEicPYW_cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zGTEicPYW_cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zGTEicPYW_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zGTEicPYW_cC&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Societies_of_Wolves_and_Free_ranging_Dog.html?hl=&id=zGTEicPYW_cC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zGTEicPYW_cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Kj7aBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Y27A5ZGnfpE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Kj7aBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Comparative Hearing: Mammals", "authors": ["Richard R.

The volumes focus on topics that have developed a solid data and conceptual foundation rather than on those for which a literature is only beginning to develop. New research areas will be covered on a timely basis in the series as they begin to mature. Each volume in the series consists of five to eight substantial chapters on a particular topic. In some cases, the topics will be ones of traditional interest for which there is a substantial body of data and theory, such as auditory neuroanatomy (Vol. 1) and neurophysiology (Vol. 2).

The number of living beings in such a land is difficult to estimate. The interactions between these organ isms and the environment are fascinating but barely understood. These features lured us to the Amazon in 1981. However, soon after, we realized that the dimensions of these interactions were overwhelming. This book is designed to review aspects of the physiology and biochemistry of fishes of the Amazon. The description of the pulsative nature of the environment and the distinct features of the ichthyofauna of the Amazon were central to the main goal. Nevertheless, any complete view is limited by the magnitude of the intraspecific variability coupled with the complex fluctuations of the environment. Thus, we have placed an emphasis on respiratory physiology and biochemistry. The reference list was made as complete as possible, particularly regarding special publications not readily available. We hope that this book is useful for comparative physiologists, tropical biologists, and the people interested in interactions between organ isms and their environment. We are grateful to many people who contributed to the making of this book. Our initial ideas were influenced by Drs.

I have defined the phrase \"respiratory function\" broadly to include, in addition to the actual oxygen and carbon dioxide transport, erythropoiesis, haemoglobin synthesis, red cell structure, the deformability of red cells in circulation, ion and substrate transport across the cell membrane, cellular metabolism, and control of cellular volume and pH. All of these aspects of the red cell function may affect gas transport between the respiratory epithelia and the tissues. Throughout the book, I have tried to relate our current knowledge about the nucleated red cell function to the wealth of information about the function of mammalian red cells. However, whenever possible, I have placed the emphasis on the nucleated red cell function for two reasons. First, the erythro cytes of 90% of vertebrate species are nucleated, and, second, nucleated red cell function has not been reviewed earlier in a single volume. This being the case, I have tried to make the reference list as complete as I could with regard to nucleated red cells. I hope that the approach adopted is useful for both com parative and human physiologists. Many people have contributed to the making of this book directly or in directly. Antti Soivio started me in this field. Prof. Henrik Wallgren has always encouraged fresh scientific ideas in his department.

Subsequently the interest in this fascinating and growing field of re search has further increased, as is reflected by numerous publications. Blue light effects cover such a wide spectrum of organisms, responses and methods that communication among scientists with backgrounds in biology, biochemistry, and biophysics is particularly necessary. These facts not only justified, but demanded calling the \"Blue Light Family\" together again. In spite of many fmancial problems, the second confer ence attracted 113 active members from 19 countries. The 2nd International Conference on The Effect of Blue Light in Plants and Microorganisms was held in July 1984, like the first at the University of Marburg. The organizer could again rely on the help of the International Advisory Committee (W. Briggs, Stanford; M. Furuya, Tokyo; J. Gressel, Rehovot; S. Miyachi, Tokyo; W. Rau, Miinchen; J. Schiff, Waltham; P .-S. Song, Lubbock). The very generous financial as sistance from the DFG and the support of the Philipps-Universitat Mar burg and its Sonderforschungsbereich \"Zellenergetik and Zelldifferen zierung\" were the prerequisites to organizing the conference. The present book consists of 56 original papers. The partitioning into eight chapters is always a problem. The grouping of different aspects of the papers into these chapters has not always been obvious, so that one or the other contribution could possibly fit in another chapter.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642697678"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642697674"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 538, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15812, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15812, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DOjwCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15812000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15812000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Blue_Light_Effects_in_Biological_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DOjwCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "T2GzCimS2XUC", "etag": "k/o0Dm0/Qgk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/T2GzCimS2XUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Squid as Experimental Animals", "authors": ["W.J., Jr. Adelman", "D.L.

Consequently we decided to rewrite the sections cover ing insect pathogens and combine these with new sections on ento mogenous nematodes and the immature stages of insect parasites. The result is the present laboratory guide, which is unique in covering all types of biotic agents which are found inside insects and cause them injury or disease. Included as parasites are insects and nematodes. Among the pathogens included are viruses, rickettsias, bacteria, fungi, and protozoans. Emphasis is placed on identification with an attempt to use the most easily recognizable characters.

Over 30 different genera (nearly 300 species) of protozoa from the rumen ecosystem have been described since their initial discovery nearly 150 years ago.

It seemed to him that with the increase in brain size and cognitive powers of our early ancestors many events in the struggle for existence would be just too distressing to observe. How comforting then, for the mother, distraught by the sight of her child being devoured by a lion, to cloud her vision with a flood of tears! Just so, though if the good doctor had pondered further, the following picture might have occurred to him, comfortable in his speculative armchair, and given him some pause for thought. ' ~ . . . . ~ . . ~ ~ . . \u2022. . u\" . . , ~- . ' _ . . . . . . . vii viii SERIES EDITOR'S FOREWORD These stories do not, of course, get us very far in understanding the evolution of tears or anything else, but they do remind us how far the study of behavioural adaptation has come this century. This is, in fact, an exciting time for students of behaviour. The last twenty years have seen a great advance in the theoretical armoury for tackling questions of behavioural evolution and adaptation, and a parallel expansion in empirical studies, particularly in the field. The concepts of inclusive fitness and the evolutionarily stable strategy, for example, have helped to explain major features of social behaviour and have generated entirely new questions and predictions for the field worker to examine.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400948648"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400948646"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 302, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-OU7tCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Gulls_and_Plovers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OU7tCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HlXmCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "NIybwax0jgs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HlXmCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Phylogeny of Human Chromosomes", "authors": ["H.N.

However, it was not until last century that, amidst a storm of opposition and highly emotional criticism, man was first conceived as a product of evolution rather than creation. Moreover, it is not yet thirty years since the chemical composition and molecular structure of the hereditary material was fully understood or the chromosome number of man became known. It should not be surprising then, to find how little, at present, we understand how our genes and chromosomes operate, and how they have evolved during phylogeny. In this work I have discussed how our own chromosomes have been transmitted and altered as far back as we may trace their phylogeny into the past. To make the work more complete, the composition and evolution of our own genome had also to be consiered in order to understand some of the recent findings at the chromosome level. These have resulted from using methods for localizing repetitive and single copy DNA sequences in chromosomes. Moreover, the development of biochemical methods of studying evolution at the macromolecular level has not only led to a more complete understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms, but has enabled us to make comparisons with evolutionary change at the chromosome level. In addition, a simple reference to the fossil record was necessary, because impressive discoveries in recent years have supplied valuable data on man's evolution.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642672606"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642672604"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 190, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-HlXmCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Phylogeny_of_Human_Chromosomes-sample-pdf.acsm?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HlXmCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CXbgBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Oi2OcRywUvo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CXbgBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Leptin and Reproduction", "authors": ["Michael C.

The growing clinical awareness of obesity as a major health risk in developed societies dovetailed perfectly with any of a number of roles that leptin might play in this abenant physiological condition. Almost unnoticed amidst the excitement generated by early leptin publications was the suggestion that the \"fat hormone\" might also regulate a wide range of systems and events important to reproduction, including pubertal development, gonadal endocrinology, fettility, and pregnancy. Recognizing this potential, a relatively small cadre of researchers began to examine leptin specifically as a reproductive hormone, thus creating a new and fertile field of investigation. Interest in this area has since gained momentum and an increased number of participants have now made significant contributions to our understanding of many leptin-related mechanisms that are relevant to reproductive biology. Leptin and Reproduction is the first major volume to specifically address leptin as a reproductive hormone and closely examines the advances made in the short time since this field of interest developed. Preeminent researchers ti'om many of the subdisciplines working within this area present a welcomed compendium of the wealth of related literature and voice novel interpretations of cun'ent advances.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461501572"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461501571"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-CXbgBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Leptin_and_Reproduction-sample-pdf.acsm?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CXbgBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "NfL4BwAAQBAJ", "etag": "A0DpG++nVYQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NfL4BwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Vanishing Animals", "authors": ["Andy Warhol", "Kurt Benirschke"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "Especially for this book, Andy Warhol has created prints (silkscreen over collage) of some of the most endangered animals in the world. Here they are joined with a stimulating text by Dr Kurt Benirschke affording the reader an opportunity to discover the lives and habits of these animals and what the outlook is for their survival. Extinction, the tragic and permanent loss of entire species of animals, should be a concern for everyone This concern and a strong desire to take action toward preventing the loss of more animals has brought about an unusual collaboration between art and science. The result is this beautiful volume in which artist and scientist have joined efforts to inform and inspire others to take action. It is hoped that these fascinating and striking portrayals will stimulate readers to join their own energies and talents to this important fight against the loss of more species. This book brings some of the less well known endangered animals to the reader's attention. These animals deserve just as much attention as the giant panda or the mountain gorilla about which so much has already been said.

During evolution, the senses of fish have adapted to the physical conditions of the environment in which different species live. As a result, the senses of fish exhibit a remarkable diversity that allows different species to deal with the physical constraints imposed by their habitat. In addition, fish have evolved several `new' sensory systems that are unique to the aquatic environment. In this book, examples of adaptation and refinement are given for six sensory systems: The visual system, The auditory system, The olfactory system, The mechanosensory lateral line system, The taste system, The electrosensory system. In each case, the environmental conditions under which a particular group of fish lives are analyzed. This is followed by a description of morphology and physiology of the sensory system and by an evaluation of its perceptional capabilities. Finally, the sensory adaptations to the particular conditions that prevail in the habitat of a species are highlighted. The various examples from different groups of fish presented in this book demonstrate the impressive capability of fish sensory systems to effectively overcome physical problems imposed by the environment.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400710603"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400710607"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 377, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-84DpCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Senses_of_Fish-sample-pdf.acsm?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=84DpCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "mNtuU10Ra8wC", "etag": "dswSCDiGDto", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mNtuU10Ra8wC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Predation in Vertebrate Communities", "subtitle": "The Bialowieza Primeval Forest as a Case Study", "authors": ["Bogumila Jedrzejewska", "Wlodzimierz Jedrzejewski"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "1998-07-20", "description": "Predation, one of the most dramatic interactions in animals' lives, has long fascinated ecologists.

Examples are: the visualization of functionally identified brain areas or neurons by activity staining or intracellular dye-iontophoresis; the resolution of synaptic connections between physiologically identified nerve cells; and the biochemical identification of specific neurons (their peptides and transmitters) by histo- and immunocytochemistry. I personally view the nervous system as an organ whose parts, continuously exchanging messages, arrive at their decisions by the cooperative phenome non of consensus and debate. This view is, admittedly, based on my own ex perience of looking at myriads of nerve cells and their connections rather than studying animal behaviour or theorizing. Numerous structural studies have demonstrated that interneurons in the brain must receive hundreds of thousands of synapses. Many neurons receive inputs from several different sensory areas: each input conveys a message about the external world and possibly also about past events which are stored within the central nervous system. Whether an interneuron responds to a certain combination of inputs may be, literally, a matter of debate whose outcome is decided at the post synaptic membrane. A nerve cell responding to an overriding command is possibly a rare event.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642821158"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642821154"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 428, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-CYvuCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Functional_Neuroanatomy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CYvuCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "gJUn4RTVZBkC", "etag": "CIcc6g8RqiY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gJUn4RTVZBkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "All Apes Great and Small", "subtitle": "Volume 1: African Apes", "authors": ["Birut\u00e9 M.F.

Tragically, the millennia since that time have seen so many species driven to extinction by human impacts, and the European bison has only narrowly avoided the same fate.

From an early stage in the restitution of the European bison, husband-and-wife team Ma\u0142gorzata Krasi\u0144ska and Zbigniew A.

It describes many problems faced by animals \u2013 those we use for food, for pleasure or in research, and those simply but harshly affected by shrinking habitats in the face of the ever-growing human population. And yet it is not a depressing read. It focuses not only on the difficulties that animals face, but on their capacity for free-choice, for joy and excitement, and on the possible ways in which the planet can be shared between species if only we take the time and trouble to think more carefully about the impact of our actions. Clive Phillips moved from the United Kingdom to take up a Foundation Chair in Animal Welfare at the University of Queensland, becoming Australia\u2019s first Professor of Animal Welfare in 2003. This cultural leap, combined with his travels in countries like Malaysia and Borneo, permits him the unique and broad perspective that forms the backbone of this book. Eschewing the normal territory patrolled by the animal scientist (explaining the physiological basis of the stress response or causation of abnormal behaviour), Clive ventures into jungles and deserts, city centres and tribal homelands, and presents a book that remarkably and successfully combines travel-diary, nature notes, social and cultural history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402092190"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1402092199"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 220, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eq28F0MMrhIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eq28F0MMrhIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eq28F0MMrhIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eq28F0MMrhIC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eq28F0MMrhIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eq28F0MMrhIC&rdid=book-eq28F0MMrhIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Welfare_of_Animals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eq28F0MMrhIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eq28F0MMrhIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "JB_pBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "dikdMGAycuY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JB_pBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Biology of Paramecium", "authors": ["R.

Since then and after an extensive search, I have accumulated some 3800 additional titles from the world's literature on Paramecium. After certain titles that largely represented abstracts and preliminary reports that were followed by full research papers were eliminated, approximately 4400 full titles from the 1600s to the present were selected for inclusion in this edition. Most of the titles in the Bibliography are the more recent ones beginning with 1953. I consider the Bibliography an important part of the book: A good title of a paper in a journal is a minature abstract of its contents. Thus, the reader who may be interested in obtaining additional information not found in the book may refer directly to the original source. A cursory examination of the Bibliography will reveal that parame cium research has extended into all branches of biology, including bio chemistry and biophysics. Like other areas of science, paramecium research has become highly specialized and fragmented. I have attempted to organize and present the basic information in one book.

We were dis cussing the structure of this book and of insect physiology books, in general, when Prof. Remmert asked me \" . . . and what about books on spider physio logy?\" Silence. Then I started to explain \"oh yes, there is a congress pro ceedings volume on this topic and there is a group with excellent publica tions on another topic . . . \", but I felt that this answer was weak. One can no longer buy the proceedings volume in a bookshop and to read a series of publications on a given topic one must search in a library for a dozen journals. Why is there not a single book on spider physiology comparable with the many books on insect physiology? Are spiders a scientific ivory tower, far from public interest and commercial importance? I do not think so, although spiders are one of the many \"forgotten\" animal groups which always grew in the shadow of the insects. There are research groups working on spider physiology, there are fascinating phenomena in this animal group and there are plenty of exciting results.

Each organ system is described in a general and comparative chapter, which is followed by shorter special chapters for the carnivores, pig, ruminants, and horse. In agreement with the original authors, substantive changes were made in several instances to take into account the results of recent research and to eliminate conflicts between views commonly held by German anatomists and those outside of Europe, but foremost to profit by the advances in Nomina anatomica veterinaria* (NAV), a uniform international nomenclature, which came into existence while this translation was in progress. This nomenclature lists a single, usually descriptive term for homologous structures in all domestic mammals, and wherever possible for the same structure in man; and thus has the potential of simplifying student instruction and promoting interdisciplinary understanding. The work of the International Committee on Veterinary Anatomical Nomenclature in many instances included re-evaluations of existing anatomical concepts; and it was these that necessitated most of the changes in the present work.

They are mammals, just like us, but still so different. The book covers bats from Latin American Maya temples to Swedish potato cellars; from the plains of Kenya to the Taiwanese mountains. We perceive their shadows flitting by in the summer nights, hear their mating calls in the darkness of autumn and see their silhouettes in the dim street light. The bats live in our houses and forage in our gardens and parks. But who are they and how do they lead their lives? The text and exquisite photos give an unsurpassed insight into the world of sounds and smells that bats encounter each night. We are told about how their senses, way beyond our human perception abilities, shape their lives. We get to know more about their habits, their long evolution and their cohabitation with humans, and how important they are to the environment. You will never again feel lonely in the darkness of the night.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319665382"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319665383"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 168, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3363, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3363, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UaRaDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3363000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3363000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bats-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UaRaDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "RrsJbgGtuPMC", "etag": "vasVf+lXGN4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RrsJbgGtuPMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Fauna and Flora of Palestine", "authors": ["Henry Baker Tristram"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2013-05-06", "description": "Originally published in 1884, this catalogue is one of the first zoological studies of the flora and fauna of Palestine.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781108042048"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "110804204X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 520, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RrsJbgGtuPMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RrsJbgGtuPMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RrsJbgGtuPMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RrsJbgGtuPMC&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fauna_and_Flora_of_Palestine.html?hl=&id=RrsJbgGtuPMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RrsJbgGtuPMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "k4yx7Kd9WXMC", "etag": "Ufhqp/4JPsU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/k4yx7Kd9WXMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biology and Conservation of Horseshoe Crabs", "authors": ["John T.

Since that time, almost 900 papers have been published on its theme. The first symposium was vital as it was the starting point for new research lines whose goal was to design and develop technological systems with properties approaching optimal biological systems. There have been highly significant developments since then in all domains related to biological sonar systems and in their appli cations to the engineering field. The time had therefore come for a multidisciplinary integration of the information gathered, not only on the evolution of systems used in animal echolocation, but on systems theory, behavior and neurobiology, signal-to-noise ratio, masking, signal processing, and measures observed in certain species against animal sonar systems. Modern electronics technology and systems theory which have been developed only since 1974 now allow designing sophisticated sonar and radar systems applying principles derived from biological systems. At the time of the Frascati meeting, integrated circuits and technol ogies exploiting computer science were not well enough developed to yield advantages now possible through use of real-time analysis, leading to, among other things, a definition of target temporal char acteristics, as biological sonar systems are able to do. All of these new technical developments necessitate close co operation between engineers and biologists within the framework of new experiments which have been designed, particularly in the past five years.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468472547"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468472542"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 1135, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=112&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-buLgBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Animal_Sonar_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=buLgBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "loDnCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "F6rFCLnOl2g", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/loDnCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Population Biology of Passerine Birds", "subtitle": "An Integrated Approach", "authors": ["Jacques Blondel", "Andrew Gosler", "Jean-Dominique Lebreton", "Robin McCleery"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "Population Biology of Passerine Birds is an up-to-date synthesis of the most recent developments in its field, especially in the framework of modern life history theories.

One important issue addressed at the conference was the mountain environment. A specific feature of high mountains is the so-called alpine zone, i. e. the treeless regions at the uppermost reaches. Though covering only a very small proportion of the land surface, the alpine zone contains a rela tively large number of plants, animals, fungi and microbes which are specifi cally adapted to cold environments. This zone contributes fundamentally to the planet's biodiversity and provides many resources for mountain dwelling as well as lowland people. However, rapid and largely man-made changes are affecting mountain ecosystems, such as soil erosion, losses of habitat and genetic diversity, and climate change, all of which have to be addressed. As stated in the European Community Biodiversity Strategy, \"the global scale of biodiversity reduction or losses and the interdependence of different species and ecosystems across national borders demands concerted international action\". Managing biodiversity in a rational and sustainable way needs basic knowledge on its qualitative and quantitative aspects at local, regional and global scales. This is particularly true for mountains, which are distributed throughout the world and are indeed hot spots of biodiversity in absolute terms as well as relative to the surrounding lowlands.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642189678"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642189679"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 479, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Zoology&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gXnnCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Alpine_Biodiversity_in_Europe-sample-pdf.acsm?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gXnnCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rbzoCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "wbPPKCb7eWI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rbzoCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Eel Biology", "authors": ["K.

Over the years, remarkable progress has been achieved in understanding the mysterious life cycle of eels that has fascinated scientists since the age of Aristotle. The spawning area of the Japanese eel was discovered and the migratory route of its larvae was elucidated. With the development of techniques for artificial induction of gonadal maturation, it became possible to obtain hatched larvae. Larval rearing to the leptocephalus stage, one of the most difficult tasks involved in eel culture, finally was achieved. By presenting these important breakthroughs, Eel Biology will be of great help in the development of effective management strategies for maintaining stable eel populations.
