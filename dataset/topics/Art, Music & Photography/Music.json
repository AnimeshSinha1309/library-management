It begins with a critical assessment of the different ways in which popular music has been studied and the difficulties and debates which surround the analysis of popular culture and popular music. Drawing on the recent work of music scholars and the popular music press, Shuker explores key subjects which shape our experience of music, including music production, the music industry, music policy, fans, audiences and subcultures, the musician as 'star', music journalism, and the reception and consumption of popular music. This fully revised and updated second edition includes: *case studies and lyrics of artists such as Shania Twain, S Club 7, The Spice Girls and Fat Boy Slim * the impact of technologies including on-line delivery and the debates over MP3 and Napster * the rise of DJ culture and the changing idea of the 'musician' * a critique of gender and sexual politics and the discrimination which exists in the music industry * moral panics over popular music including the controversies surrounding artists such as Marilyn Manson and Ice-T * a comprehensive discography, guide to further reading and directory of websites.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781134564798"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1134564791"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.3.3.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hIEJyToJYl0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hIEJyToJYl0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hIEJyToJYl0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hIEJyToJYl0C&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_Popular_Music.html?hl=&id=hIEJyToJYl0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Understanding_Popular_Music-sample-epub.acsm?id=hIEJyToJYl0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Understanding_Popular_Music-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hIEJyToJYl0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hIEJyToJYl0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ZZQRQ4PRYKsC", "etag": "hg60Q9aOgKc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZZQRQ4PRYKsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "78 Blues", "subtitle": "Folksongs and Phonographs in the American South", "authors": ["John Minton"], "publisher": "Univ.

In the postwar period, regional strains recorded on pioneering 78 r.p.m. discs exploded into urban blues and R&B, honky-tonk and western swing, gospel, soul, and rock 'n' roll. These old-time records preserve the work of some of America's greatest musical geniuses such as Jimmie Rodgers, Robert Johnson, Charlie Poole, and Blind Lemon Jefferson. They are also crucial mile markers in the course of American popular music and the growth of the modern recording industry. When these records first circulated, the very notion of recorded music was still a novelty. All music had been created live and tied to particular, intimate occasions. How were listeners to understand an impersonal technology like the phonograph record as a musical event? How could they reconcile firsthand interactions and traditional customs with technological innovations and mass media? The records themselves, several hundred of which are explored fully in this book, offer answers in scores of spoken commentaries and skits, in song lyrics and monologues, or other more subtle means.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1604733276"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781604733273"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZZQRQ4PRYKsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZZQRQ4PRYKsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZZQRQ4PRYKsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZZQRQ4PRYKsC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZZQRQ4PRYKsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2642.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2642.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZZQRQ4PRYKsC&rdid=book-ZZQRQ4PRYKsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2642300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2642300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZZQRQ4PRYKsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0lhuDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "sLzHtKuNmTc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0lhuDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Our Hearts Invented a Place", "subtitle": "Can Kibbutzim Survive in Today's Israel?", "authors": ["Jo-Ann Mort", "Gary Brenner"], "publisher": "Cornell University Press", "publishedDate": "2018-09-05", "description": "\"We thought we were living in a society of the future, showing how people can live together in a way that the human being is not a product of society where you have to put somebody down so that you are up.... Suddenly we [find] that people want to be more like outside, and we are disappointed.\" \"When people say to me, 'We're so sorry to see what's going on in the kibbutzim because we are losing the most important thing that happened to the State of Israel,' I say to them, 'Listen....' The government lost interest in the kibbutz movement, and we had to find another way. The State of Israel slowly but surely became a normal state, and the pioneers finished their job. We are living in a new era. We have to make the adjustment.\"\u2014from Our Hearts Invented a Place One of the grand social experiments of modern time, the Israeli kibbutz is today in a state of flux. Created initially to advance Zionism, support national security, and forge a new socialist, communal model, the kibbutzim no longer serve a clear purpose and are struggling financially. In Our Hearts Invented a Place, Jo-Ann Mort and Gary Brenner describe how life on the kibbutz is changing as members seek to adapt to contemporary realities and prepare themselves for the future. Throughout, the authors allow the members' often-impassioned voices\u2014some disillusioned, some optimistic, some pragmatic\u2014to be heard. \"The founders [of the kibbutz] had a dream,\" an Israeli told the authors in one of many interviews they conducted between 2000 and 2002, \"[which] they fulfilled... a hundred times.\" The current generation, he explains, must alter that dream in order for it to survive. After tracing the formidable challenges facing the kibbutzim today, Mort and Brenner compare three distinct models of change as exemplified by three different communities. The first, Gesher Haziv, decided to pursue privatization. The second, Hatzor, is diversifying its economy while creating an extensive social safety net and a system of private wages with progressive taxation. In the third instance, Gan Shmuel is attempting to hold on to the traditional kibbutz model. In closing, the authors address the new-style urban kibbutz. Their book will provide readers with a deeper understanding of the kibbutz\u2014and of Israel itself\u2014during an era of dramatic social, economic, and political change.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781501729003"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1501729004"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 232, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0lhuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0lhuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0lhuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0lhuDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Our_Hearts_Invented_a_Place.html?hl=&id=0lhuDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0lhuDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "-1l6AwAAQBAJ", "etag": "W+j+Z5VXNyI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/-1l6AwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Strictly Classics, Book 1", "subtitle": "Violin", "authors": ["John O'Reilly"], "publisher": "Alfred Music", "publishedDate": "2005-05-03", "description": "This flexible new collection of string ensembles will inspire chamber music performance while introducing beginners to some of the greatest classic themes ever written.

It traces the development of ancient melodic notation from reconstructed origins, through various adaptations necessitated by changing musical styles and newly invented instruments, to its final canonical form. It thus emerges how closely ancient harmonic theory depended on the culturally dominant instruments, the lyre and the aulos. These threads are followed down to late antiquity, when details recorded by Ptolemy permit an exceptionally clear view. Dr Hagel discusses the textual and pictorial evidence, introducing mathematical approaches wherever feasible, but also contributes to the interpretation of instruments in the archaeological record and occasionally is able to outline the general features of instruments not directly attested.

The book considers sounds and music as experienced in such diverse settings as shop floors, laboratories, clinics, design studios, homes, and clubs, across an impressively broad range of historical periods and national and cultural contexts.Science has traditionally been understood as a visual matter, a study which has historically been undertaken with optical technologies such as slides, graphs, and telescopes. This book questions that notion powerfully by showing how listening has contributed to scientific practice. Sounds have always been a part of human experience, shaping and transforming the world in which we live in ways that often go unnoticed. Sounds and music, the authors argue, are embedded in the fabric of everyday life, art, commerce, and politics in ways which impact our perception of the world. Through an extraordinarily diverse set of case studies, authors illustrate how sounds -- from the sounds of industrialization, to the sounds of automobiles, to sounds in underwater music and hip-hop, to the sounds of nanotechnology -- give rise to new forms listening practices. In addition, the book discusses the rise of new public problems such as noise pollution, hearing loss, and the \"end\" of the amateur musician that stem from the spread and appropriation of new sound- and music-related technologies, analog and digital, in many domains of life.Rich in vivid and detailed examples and compelling case studies, and featuring a companion website of listening samples, this remarkable volume boldly challenges readers to rethink the way they hear and understand the world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780195388947"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0195388941"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 593, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Sound_Studies.html?hl=&id=KuRfLG0IedYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "XQMHSlRipBEC", "etag": "8xk0kEiDIxo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/XQMHSlRipBEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Sound Tracks", "subtitle": "Popular Music, Identity, and Place", "authors": ["John Connell", "Chris Gibson", "Professor John Connell"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "Sound Tracks traces the ways in which music has informed complex globalisations, the role of companies and technology in diffusion, innovation and commercialism and the wider significance of cultural industries.

In addition they recorded versions of some of their biggest hits in Swedish, German, French, and Spanish; performed a number of songs in concert that were never released on record; and recorded a number of songs that didn't see the light of day at the time, but have been released from the archive the decades since the group 'took a break'; at the end of 1982. Everyone remembers ABBA's biggest hits - songs like 'Waterloo', 'Mamma Mia', 'Fernando', 'Dancing Queen', 'Take A Chance On Me', 'Chiquitita', and 'The Winner Takes It All' - but there are many gems to be found on the eight studio albums and 21 singles released during the group's lifetime. 'ABBA: Song by Song'; is a look at every single song by the Swedish supergroup, written by a life-long ABBA fan.

An artist who helped define a period in popular culture, Johnny Marr tells his story in a memoir as vivid and arresting as his music. The Smiths, the band with the signature sound he cofounded, remains one of the most beloved bands ever, and have a profound influence on a number of acts that followed\u2014from the Stone Roses, Suede, Blur, and Radiohead to Oasis, The Libertines, and Arctic Monkeys. Marr recalls his childhood growing up in the northern working-class city of Manchester, in a house filled with music. He takes us back to the summer of 1982 when, at eighteen, he sought out one Stephen Morrissey to form a new band they called The Smiths. Marr invites fans on stage, on the road, and in the studio for the five years The Smiths were together and how after a rapid ascent, the working-class teenage rock star enjoyed and battled with the perks of success until ideological differences, combined with his much publicized strained relationships with fellow band mates, caused him to leave in 1987. Marr\u2019s \u201cescape\u201d as he calls it, ensured the beginning of the end for one of the most influential groups of a generation. But The Smiths\u2019 end was only the beginning for Marr. The bona-fide guitar hero continues to experiment and evolve in his solo career to this day, playing with Paul McCartney, Pretenders, Modest Mouse, Oasis and collaborating today\u2019s most creative and renowned artists. Rising above and beyond the personal struggles and bitter feuds, Marr delivers the story of his music and his band, sharing the real insights of a man who has made music his life, and finally giving fans what they\u2019ve truly been waiting for.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062438720"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062438727"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.5.4.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJSTCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJSTCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MJSTCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MJSTCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Set_the_Boy_Free.html?hl=&id=MJSTCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Set_the_Boy_Free-sample-epub.acsm?id=MJSTCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MJSTCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cuFu7ipCl5kC", "etag": "0NEPpAD2L1k", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cuFu7ipCl5kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "African Polyphony and Polyrhythm", "subtitle": "Musical Structure and Methodology", "authors": ["Simha Arom", "Martin Thom", "Barbara Tuckett", "Raymond Boyd"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2004-12-02", "description": "An original approach to the understanding of the complete and sophisticated patterns of polyphony and polyrhythm of African music.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521616018"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521616010"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 668, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cuFu7ipCl5kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cuFu7ipCl5kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cuFu7ipCl5kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cuFu7ipCl5kC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Polyphony_and_Polyrhythm.html?hl=&id=cuFu7ipCl5kC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cuFu7ipCl5kC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "dPArKKU3pkgC", "etag": "S0E+wVeN9Fc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/dPArKKU3pkgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Losing My Cool", "subtitle": "Love, Literature, and a Black Man's Escape from the Crowd", "authors": ["Thomas Chatterton Williams"], "publisher": "Penguin", "publishedDate": "2010-04-29", "description": "A pitch-perfect account of how hip-hop culture drew in the author and how his father drew him out again-with love, perseverance, and fifteen thousand books. Into Williams's childhood home-a one-story ranch house-his father crammed more books than the local library could hold. \"Pappy\" used some of these volumes to run an academic prep service; the rest he used in his unending pursuit of wisdom. His son's pursuits were quite different-\"money, hoes, and clothes.\" The teenage Williams wore Medusa- faced Versace sunglasses and a hefty gold medallion, dumbed down and thugged up his speech, and did whatever else he could to fit into the intoxicating hip-hop culture that surrounded him. Like all his friends, he knew exactly where he was the day Biggie Smalls died, he could recite the lyrics to any Nas or Tupac song, and he kept his woman in line, with force if necessary. But Pappy, who grew up in the segregated South and hid in closets so he could read Aesop and Plato, had a different destiny in mind for his son. For years, Williams managed to juggle two disparate lifestyles- \"keeping it real\" in his friends' eyes and studying for the SATs under his father's strict tutelage. As college approached and the stakes of the thug lifestyle escalated, the revolving door between Williams's street life and home life threatened to spin out of control. Ultimately, Williams would have to decide between hip-hop and his future. Would he choose \"street dreams\" or a radically different dream- the one Martin Luther King spoke of or the one Pappy held out to him now? Williams is the first of his generation to measure the seductive power of hip-hop against its restrictive worldview, which ultimately leaves those who live it powerless. Losing My Cool portrays the allure and the danger of hip-hop culture like no book has before. Even more remarkably, Williams evokes the subtle salvation that literature offers and recounts with breathtaking clarity a burgeoning bond between father and son.

Learn to use inexpensive and readily available parts to obtain state-of-the-art performance in all the vital parameters of noise, distortion, crosstalk and so on. Focusing mainly on preamplifiers and mixers this practical handbook gives you an extensive repertoire of circuits that can be put together to make almost any type of audio system. A resource packed full of valuable information, with virtually every page revealing nuggets of specialized knowledge never before published. Essential points of theory that bear on practical performance are lucidly and thoroughly explained, with the mathematics kept to an essential minimum. Douglas' background in design for manufacture ensures he keeps a wary eye on the cost of things. Includes a chapter on power-supplies, full of practical ways to keep both the ripple and the cost down, showing how to power everything. Douglas wears his learning lightly, and this book features the engaging prose style familiar to readers of his other books The Audio Power Amplifier Design Handbook and Self on Audio.

Taking the form of an \"oral\" history, this books contains over 130 interviews, along with essential background information from acclaimed music writer Greg Prato. The early '90s grunge movement may have last only a few years, but it spawned some of the greatest rock music of all time: Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden. This book contains the first-ever interview in which Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder was willing to discuss the group's history in great detail; Alice in Chains' band members and Layne Staley's mom on Staley's drug addiction and death; insights into the Riot Grrrl movement and oft-overlooked but highly influential Seattle bands like Mother Love Bone/Andy Wood, the Melvins, Screaming Trees, and Mudhoney; and much more. Grunge Is Dead digs deeper than the average grunge history, starting in the early '60s, and explaining the chain of events that gave way to the grunge movement. The end result is a book that includes a wealth of previously untold stories and insight for the longtime fan, as well as its renowned story for the newcomer.

Contestation is understood as a discourse shaped by the assumptions and practices of artists, producers, the media and audiences, for whom it makes sense to reject politically reactionary ideas and the dominant taste for commercial pop. Placing music in its economic, historical and ideological context, however, reveals the fragility and instability of these oppositions. The book firstly concentrates on music production in France, the relationships between independent labels, major companies and the state's cultural policies. This section provides the material background for understanding the development of rock alternatif, France's self-styled 'subversive' genre of the 1980s, and explains the specificity of a 'protest' music culture in late-twentieth-century France, in relation to the genre's tradition in the West. The second part looks at representations of a 'protest' identity in relation to discourses of national identity, focusing on two 1990s sub-genres. The first, chanson n\u00e9o-r\u00e9aliste, contests modernity through the use of acoustic instruments, but its nostalgic 'protest' raises questions about the artists' real engagement with the present. The second, rock m\u00e9tis, borrows from North African and Latino rhythms and challenges the 'neutral' Frenchness of the Republic, while advocating multiculturalism in problematic ways. A discussion of Manu Chao's career, a French artist who has achieved success abroad, also allows an exploration of the relationship between transnationalism and anti-globalization politics. Finally, the book examines the audiences of French 'protest' music and considers festivals as places of 'non-mainstream' identity negotiation. Based on first-hand interviews, this section highlights the vocabulary of emotions that audiences use to make sense of an 'alternative' performance, unveiling the contradictions that underpin their self-definition as participants in a 'protest' culture. The book contributes to debates on the cultural production of 'resistance' and the representation of post-colonial identities, uncovering the social constructedness of the discourse of 'protest' in France. It pays attention to its nation-specific character while offering a wider reflection on the fluidity of 'subversive' identities, with potential applications across a range of Western music practices.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781409493891"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "140949389X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 204, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.5.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Protest_Music_in_France.html?hl=&id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protest_Music_in_France-sample-epub.acsm?id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protest_Music_in_France-sample-pdf.acsm?id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wt2hAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "1veFDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "W4GayqWAmQE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1veFDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ennio Morricone", "subtitle": "In His Own Words", "authors": ["Alessandro De Rosa"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2019-02-01", "description": "Master composer Ennio Morricone's scores go hand-in-hand with the idea of the Western film. Often considered the world's greatest living film composer, and most widely known for his innovative scores to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and the other Sergio Leone's movies, The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and more recently, The Hateful Eight, Morricone has spent the past 60 years reinventing the sound of cinema. In Ennio Morricone: In His Own Words, composers Ennio Morricone and Alessandro De Rosa present a years-long discussion of life, music, and the marvelous and unpredictable ways that the two come into contact with and influence each other. The result is what Morricone himself defines: \"beyond a shadow of a doubt the best book ever written about me, the most authentic, the most detailed and well curated. The truest.\" Opening for the first time the door of his creative laboratory, Morricone offers an exhaustive and rich account of his life, from his early years of study to genre-defining collaborations with the most important Italian and international directors, including Leone, Bertolucci, Pasolini, Argento, Tornatore, Malick, Carpenter, Stone, Nichols, De Palma, Beatty, Levinson, Almod\u00f3var, Polanski and Tarantino. In the process, Morricone unveils the curious relationship that links music and images in cinema, as well as the creative urgency at the foundation of his experimentations with \"absolute music\". Throughout these conversations with De Rosa, Morricone dispenses invaluable insights not only on composing but also on the broader process of adaptation and what it means to be human. As he reminds us, \"Coming into contact with memories doesn't only entail the melancholy of something that slips away with time, but also looking forward, understanding who I am now. And who knows what else may still happen.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190681029"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190681020"}], "readingModes": {"text":

music as these have been shaped not only by hearing but also by seeing music in performance. His purview is the northern European bourgeoisie, principally in England and the Low Countries, from 1600 to 1900. And his particular interest is the relation of music to the human body. He argues that musical practices, invariably linked to the body, are inseparable from the prevailing discourses of power, knowledge, identity, desire, and sexuality. With the support of 100 illustrations, Leppert addresses music and the production of racism, the hoarding of musical sound in a culture of scarcity, musical consumption and the policing of gender, the domestic piano and misogyny, music and male anxiety, and the social silencing of music. His unexpected yoking of musicology and art history, in particular his original insights into the relationships between music, visual representation, and the history of the body, make exciting reading for scholars, students, and all those interested in society and the arts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0520917170"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780520917170"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 345, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrJb4caOn9QC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3254.36, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3254.36, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&rdid=book-rrJb4caOn9QC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3254360000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3254360000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Sight_of_Sound-sample-epub.acsm?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Sight_of_Sound-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rrJb4caOn9QC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "5izKDAAAQBAJ", "etag": "oj38qIyzBuI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5izKDAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Entertaining Lisbon", "subtitle": "Music, Theater, and Modern Life in the Late 19th Century", "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o Silva"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2016-10-03", "description": "During the decades leading up to 1910, Portugal saw vast material improvements under the guise of modernization while in the midst of a significant political transformation - the establishment of the Portuguese First Republic. Urban planning, everyday life, and innovation merged in a rapidly changing Lisbon. Leisure activities for the citizens of the First Republic began to include new forms of musical theater, including operetta and the revue theater. These theatrical forms became an important site for the display of modernity, and the representation of a new national identity. Author Jo\u00e3o Silva argues that the rise of these genres is inextricably bound to the complex process through which the idea of Portugal was presented, naturalized, and commodified as a modern nation-state. Entertaining Lisbon studies popular entertainment in Portugal and its connections with modern life and nation-building, showing that the promotion of the nation through entertainment permeated the market for cultural goods. Exploring the Portuguese entertainment market as a reflection of ongoing negotiations between local, national, and transnational influences on identity, Silva intertwines representations of gender, class, ethnicity, and technology with theatrical repertoires, street sounds, and domestic music making. An essential work on Portuguese music in the English language, Entertaining Lisbon is a critical study for scholars and students of musicology interested in Portugal, and popular and theatrical musics, as well as historical ethnomusicologists, cultural historians, and urban planning researchers interested in the development of material culture.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780190215705"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0190215704"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fados"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5izKDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5izKDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5izKDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5izKDAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Entertaining_Lisbon.html?hl=&id=5izKDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5izKDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "APmUFlgm0R4C", "etag": "JskMAHWFofs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/APmUFlgm0R4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Listening to the Future", "subtitle": "The Time of Progressive Rock, 1968-1978", "authors": ["Bill Martin"], "publisher": "Open Court Publishing", "publishedDate": "1998", "description": "Looks at the progressive rock music of the early 1970's, including King Crimson, Yes, Jethro Tull, and Emerson, Lake Nd Palmer, as well as lesser known bands", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "081269368X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780812693683"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 356, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Listening_to_the_Future.html?hl=&id=APmUFlgm0R4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_DGKDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "dkKUgg3Oj9w", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_DGKDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Perfect Sound Whatever", "subtitle": "THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER", "authors": ["James Acaster"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2019-08-22", "description": "*The Sunday Times Bestseller* The brand new memoir from James Acaster: cult comedian, bestselling author of Classic Scrapes, undercover cop, receiver of cabbages. PERFECT SOUND WHATEVER is a love letter to the healing power of music, and how one man's obsessive quest saw him defeat the bullshit of one year with the beauty of another. Because that one man is James Acaster, it also includes tales of befouling himself in a Los Angeles steakhouse, stealing a cookie from Clint Eastwood, and giving drunk, unsolicited pep talks to urinating strangers. January, 2017 James Acaster wakes up heartbroken and alone in New York, his relationship over, a day of disastrous meetings leading him to wonder if comedy is really what he wants to be doing any more. A constant comfort in James's life has been music, but he's not listened to anything new for a very long time. Idly browsing 'best of the year' lists, it dawns on him that 2016 may have been a grim year for a lot of reasons, but that it seemed to be an iconic year for music. And so begins a life-changing musical odyssey, as James finds himself desperately seeking solace in the music of 2016, setting himself the task of only listening to music released that year, ending up with 500 albums in his collection. Looking back on this year-long obsession, parallels begin to grow between the music and James's own life: his relationship history, the highs and lows of human connection, residual Christian guilt, and mental health issues that have been bubbling under the surface for years. Some albums are life-changing masterpieces, others are 'Howdilly Doodilly' by Okilly Dokilly, a metalcore album devoted to The Simpsons' character Ned Flanders, but all of them play a part the year that helped James Acaster get his life back on track.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781472260321"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1472260325"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1392.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 696.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_DGKDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1392400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 696200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Perfect_Sound_Whatever-sample-epub.acsm?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_DGKDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "17q4AgAAQBAJ", "etag": "hCDt3VTR6N4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/17q4AgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Domenico Scarlatti: 30 Sonatas", "subtitle": "", "authors": ["DOMENICO SCARLATTI"], "publisher": "Mel Bay Publications", "publishedDate": "2012-07-12", "description": "An exact contemporary of Bach and Handel, Domenico Scarlatti was already a celebrated composer in Italy by the time he moved to Portugal.

Covering both experimental and theoretical perspectives, each of the 11 sections is edited by an internationally recognised authority in the area. The first ten parts present chapters that focus on specific areas of music psychology: the origins and functions of music; music perception, responses to music; music and the brain; musical development; learning musical skills; musical performance; composition and improvisation; the role of music in everyday life; and music therapy. In each part authors critically review the literature, highlight current issues and explore possibilities for the future. The final part examines how, in recent years, the study of music psychology has broadened to include a range of other disciplines. It considers the way that research has developed in relation to technological advances, and points the direction for further development in the field.

Kod\u00e1ly in the Kindergarten Classroom is the first comprehensive handbook to update and apply the Kod\u00e1ly concepts to teaching music in early childhood classrooms. Kod\u00e1ly in the Kindergarten Classroom provides teachers with a step-by-step road map for developing children's performance, creative movement, and literacy skills in an organic and thoughtful manner. Through six years of field-testing with music kindergarten teachers in the United States, Great Britain, and Hungary (the home country of Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly), authors Miche\u00e1l Houlahan and Philip Tacka have developed a methodology specifically for 21st century classrooms. Houlahan and Tacka use the latest research findings in cognition and perception to create a system not only appropriate for kindergarteners' particular developmental stages but also one which integrates vertically between kindergarten and elementary music classes. The methods outlined in this volume encourage greater musical ability and creativity in children by teaching kindergarteners to sing, move, play instruments, and develop music literacy skills. In addition, Kod\u00e1ly in the Kindergarten Classroom promotes critical thinking, problem solving, and collaboration skills. Although the book uses the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy, its methodology has also been tested by teachers certified in Orff and Dalcroze, and has proven an essential guide for teachers no matter what their personal philosophy and specific training might be. Over 100 children's books are incorporated into Kod\u00e1ly in the Kindergarten Classroom, as well as 35 detailed lesson plans that demonstrate how music and literacy curriculum goals are transformed into tangible musical objectives. Scholarly yet practical and accessible, this volume is sure to be an essential guide for kindergarten and early childhood music teachers everywhere.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199396498"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199396493"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 576, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2hV0BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2hV0BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2hV0BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2hV0BgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Kodaly_in_the_Kindergarten_Classroom.html?hl=&id=2hV0BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2hV0BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "UwrtfNYIylQC", "etag": "hza6iWlxgWE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/UwrtfNYIylQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Poetics of Music in the Form of Six Lessons", "authors": ["Igor Stravinsky"], "publisher": "Harvard University Press", "publishedDate": "1947", "description": "The distinguished composer discusses the phenomenon of music, its composition and performance, music typology, and the avatars of Russian music", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0674678567"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780674678569"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 142, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UwrtfNYIylQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UwrtfNYIylQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UwrtfNYIylQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UwrtfNYIylQC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Poetics_of_Music_in_the_Form_of_Six_Less.html?hl=&id=UwrtfNYIylQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Poetics_of_Music_in_the_Form_of_Six_Less-sample-epub.acsm?id=UwrtfNYIylQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UwrtfNYIylQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "MQzvqUGhNxAC", "etag": "B9j6uGMq84o", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MQzvqUGhNxAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Defining Russia Musically", "subtitle": "Historical and Hermeneutical Essays", "authors": ["Richard Taruskin"], "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "publishedDate": "2000", "description": "with an air of alterity--sensed, exploited, bemoaned, reveled in, traded on, and defended against both from within and from without.\" The author's goal is to explore this assumption of otherness in an all-encompassing work that re-creates the cultural contexts of the folksong anthologies of the 1700s, the operas, symphonies, and ballets of the 1800s, the modernist masterpieces of the 1900s, and the hugely fraught but ambiguous products of the Soviet period.

It is through lyric diction that singers are able to communicate the wishes and desires of the poet, as well as the composer. Far beyond memorizing the rules of pronunciation, the study of diction involves learning to perceive speech patterns in different languages, practicing their precise articulation, recognizing this in one's own speech and singing, as well as in that of others, and developing an awareness of the refined, delicate movements of the articulators and their subsequent effect on singing tone. Amanda Johnston takes a modernized approach to the study of lyric diction in English and German Diction for Singers. Utilizing the latest adaptation of the Neue Rechtschreibung (2009), Johnston makes German increasingly accessible through the recognition that English and German are related languages, and thus have many things in common with regard to lyric diction. This comprehensive resource includes a thorough analysis of the German and English languages, as well as lists, tables, charts, musical examples, and even tongue twisters. Specific topics addressed include the German schwa, the use of the curly-tail J in German, the treatment of R in both languages, and the correct formation of the elusive open U and the extended Epsilon. Lyric diction is a mandatory subject area for all prospective opera singers and music students enrolled in an academic institution. This book is designed for both undergraduate and graduate courses in German and English lyric diction and is an invaluable resource for classical singers, vocal coaches, and voice teachers alike.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461658405"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461658403"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8OUqUdZsSLoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8OUqUdZsSLoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8OUqUdZsSLoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=53&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8OUqUdZsSLoC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/English_and_German_Diction_for_Singers.html?hl=&id=8OUqUdZsSLoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/English_and_German_Diction_for_Singers-sample-epub.acsm?id=8OUqUdZsSLoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/English_and_German_Diction_for_Singers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8OUqUdZsSLoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8OUqUdZsSLoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "v5XCDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "aNcMnqI0vbY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/v5XCDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "More Myself", "subtitle": "A Journey", "authors": ["Alicia Keys"], "publisher": "Pan Macmillan", "publishedDate": "2020-03-31", "description": "As one of the most celebrated musicians of our time, Alicia Keys has enraptured the nation with her heartfelt lyrics, extraordinary vocal range, and soul-stirring piano compositions. Yet away from the spotlight, Alicia has grappled with private heartache over the challenging and complex relationship with her father, the people-pleasing nature that characterized her early career, the loss of privacy surrounding her romantic relationships, and the oppressive expectations of female perfection. Since her rise to fame, Alicia\u2019s public persona has belied a deep personal truth: she has spent years not fully recognizing or honoring her own worth. After withholding parts of herself for so long, she is at last exploring the questions that live at the heart of her story: Who am I, really? And once I discover that truth, how can I become brave enough to embrace it? More Myself is part autobiography, part narrative documentary. Alicia\u2019s journey is revealed not only through her own candid recounting, but also through vivid recollections from those who have walked alongside her. The result is a 360-degree perspective on Alicia\u2019s path: from her girlhood in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Harlem, to the process of self-discovery she\u2019s still navigating. In More Myself, Alicia shares her quest for truth: about herself, her past, and her shift from sacrificing her spirit to celebrating her worth. With the raw honesty that epitomizes Alicia\u2019s artistry, More Myself is at once a riveting account and a clarion call to readers: to define themselves in a world that rarely encourages a true and unique identity.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781529046052"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "152904605X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=54&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 842.86, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 421.43, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-v5XCDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 842860000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 421430000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/More_Myself-sample-epub.acsm?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=v5XCDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "PFJO1lGcNLgC", "etag": "ZCkuTgVWxqA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/PFJO1lGcNLgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Saxophone For Dummies", "authors": ["Denis G\u00e4bel", "Michael Villmow"], "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11", "description": "The fast and easy way to play this popular woodwindinstrument Saxophone For Dummies offers the ideal introduction tothis popular and versatile instrument, whether you lack any musicalexperience or are picking up the sax again after a hiatus.

The youngest daughter of one of the most famous American ballad-singing families, the Ritchie family of Perry County, Kentucky, Jean carries on her family's legacy as a singer of folk songs and traditional ballads. The music found here tells the story of the \"\"Singing Ritchie Family.\"\" Built upon a foundation of balladry inherited from old-world Scotland, the family's repertoire was certainly eclectic but not haphazard. The Child ballads, lyric folksongs, play party or frolic songs, Old Regular Baptist lined hymns, Native American ballads, \"hant\" songs, and carols brought together in this collection were assembled by family members who actively sought out fragments of tunes and completed them by adding or embellishing verses and melodies. This new edition has faithfully retained all seventy-seven line scores of the songs and added four new ones, Loving Hannah, Lovin' Henry, Her Mantle So Green, and The Reckless and Rambling Boy. The original headnotes and photographs tell the history of the song as well as how it became a part of the family's life.

Throughout his career, Sebastian Bach has sold over twenty million records both as the lead singer of Skid Row and as a solo artist. He is particularly known for the hit singles I Remember You, Youth Gone Wild, & 18 & Life, and the albums Skid Row and Slave To The Grind, which became the first ever hard rock album to debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 and landed him on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Bach then went on to become the first rock star to grace the Broadway stage, with starring roles in Jekyll & Hyde, Jesus Christ Superstar and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. He also appeared for seven seasons on the hit television show The Gilmore Girls. In his memoir, Bach recounts lurid tales of excess and debauchery as he toured the world with Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Motley Crue, Soundgarden, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails and Guns N\u2019 Roses. Filled with backstage photos from his own personal collection, 18 And Life on Skid Row is the story of hitting it big at a young age, and of a band that broke up in its prime. It is the story of a man who achieved his wildest dreams, only to lose his family, and then his home.

Through it all, Motown provided the beat. This book tells the story of Motown--as both musical style and entrepreneurial phenomenon--and of its intrinsic relationship to the politics and culture of Motor Town, USA. As Suzanne Smith traces the evolution of Motown from a small record company firmly rooted in Detroit's black community to an international music industry giant, she gives us a clear look at cultural politics at the grassroots level. Here we see Motown's music not as the mere soundtrack for its historical moment but as an active agent in the politics of the time. In this story, Motown Records had a distinct role to play in the city's black community as that community articulated and promoted its own social, cultural, and political agendas. Smith shows how these local agendas, which reflected the unique concerns of African Americans living in the urban North, both responded to and reconfigured the national civil rights campaign. Against a background of events on the national scene--featuring Martin Luther King, Jr., Langston Hughes, Nat King Cole, and Malcolm X--\"Dancing in the Street\" presents a vivid picture of the civil rights movement in Detroit, with Motown at its heart. This is a lively and vital history. It's peopled with a host of major and minor figures in black politics, culture, and the arts, and full of the passions of a momentous era. It offers a critical new perspective on the role of popular culture in the process of political change.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0674043839"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780674043831"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dcavF3kwTSEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dcavF3kwTSEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dcavF3kwTSEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dcavF3kwTSEC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dancing_in_the_Street.html?hl=&id=dcavF3kwTSEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dancing_in_the_Street-sample-pdf.acsm?id=dcavF3kwTSEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dcavF3kwTSEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "SaK8HLZsTFkC", "etag": "6GT2MvB59S0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/SaK8HLZsTFkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "1000 Keyboard Ideas", "authors": ["Ronald Herder"], "publisher": "Shacor, Inc.", "publishedDate": "1990", "description": "The greatest tips and tricks used by professional musicians to create their unique sounds - by the best experts in the field!

Gershwin created some of the most beloved music of the twentieth century and, along with Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and Cole Porter, helped make the golden age of Broadway golden. Howard Pollack draws from a wealth of sketches, manuscripts, letters, interviews, books, articles, recordings, films, and other materials\u2014including a large cache of Gershwin scores discovered in a Warner Brothers warehouse in 1982\u2014to create an expansive chronicle of Gershwin\u2019s meteoric rise to fame. He also traces Gershwin\u2019s powerful presence that, even today, extends from Broadway, jazz clubs, and film scores to symphony halls and opera houses. Pollack\u2019s lively narrative describes Gershwin\u2019s family, childhood, and education; his early career as a pianist; his friendships and romantic life; his relation to various musical trends; his writings on music; his working methods; and his tragic death at the age of 38. Unlike Kern, Berlin, and Porter, who mostly worked within the confines of Broadway and Hollywood, Gershwin actively sought to cross the boundaries between high and low, and wrote works that crossed over into a realm where art music, jazz, and Broadway met and merged. The author surveys Gershwin\u2019s entire oeuvre, from his first surviving compositions to the melodies that his brother and principal collaborator, Ira Gershwin, lyricized after his death. Pollack concludes with an exploration of the performances and critical reception of Gershwin's music over the years, from his time to ours.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0520933141"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780520933149"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 906, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RySwdc151ZoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RySwdc151ZoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RySwdc151ZoC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RySwdc151ZoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4839.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4839.74, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RySwdc151ZoC&rdid=book-RySwdc151ZoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4839740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4839740000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/George_Gershwin-sample-pdf.acsm?id=RySwdc151ZoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RySwdc151ZoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "BONKDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "mQX4n8hoveU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BONKDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Utopia Avenue", "authors": ["David Mitchell"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2020-07-14", "description": "Pre-order the spectacular new novel from the bestselling author of CLOUD ATLAS and THE BONE CLOCKS, 'one of the most brilliantly inventive writers of this, or any country' (Independent). 'The great rock and roll novel - an epic love letter to the greatest music ever made and the book the music has always deserved' Tony Parsons Utopia Avenue might be the most curious British band you've never heard of. Emerging from London's psychedelic scene in 1967, folksinger Elf Holloway, blues bassist Dean Moss, guitar virtuoso Jasper de Zoet and jazz drummer Griff Griffin together created a unique sound, with lyrics that captured their turbulent times. The band produced only two albums in two years, yet their musical legacy lives on. This is the story of Utopia Avenue's brief, blazing journey from Soho clubs and draughty ballrooms to the promised land of America, just when the Summer of Love was receding into something much darker - a multi-faceted tale of dreams, drugs, love, sexuality, madness and grief; of stardom's wobbly ladder and fame's Faustian pact; and of the collision between youthful idealism and jaded reality as the Sixties drew to a close. Above all, this bewitching novel celebrates the power of music to connect across divides, define an era and thrill the soul. Praise for David Mitchell's previous work: 'Open up his head and a whole magical, ecstatic symphony of inventiveness and ideals will fly out.' The Times 'Mitchell's imagination is boundless and absolutely thorough, and he is also very funny.' Sunday Telegraph 'An author of extraordinary ambition and skill.'

Each essay offers critical reflections on a key topic in contemporary music education. The starting point of each essay, and the unifying thread of this collection, is the \"praxial\" philosophy of music education explained in Elliott's Music Matters: A New Philosophy of Music Education (OUP, 1995). This philosophy argues for a socially and artistically grounded concept of music and music education, challenging the field's traditional \"absolutist\" foundations. Praxial Music Education is both a critical companion to Music Matters, and an independent text on contemporary issues in music education. Among the themes discussed are multicultural music education, the nature of musical understanding, early childhood music education, the nature and teaching of music listening, music curriculum development, and musical creativity. Praxial music education is a living theory. This unique collection will not only enrich discussions that already use Music Matters as their core, but will globalize current discussions and applications of the praxial philosophy and emphasize the positive and practical values of collaborative efforts in music education.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780195350142"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0195350146"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.2.4.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1XI_l4DK9NIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1XI_l4DK9NIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1XI_l4DK9NIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1XI_l4DK9NIC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Praxial_Music_Education_Reflections_and.html?hl=&id=1XI_l4DK9NIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Praxial_Music_Education_Reflections_and-sample-epub.acsm?id=1XI_l4DK9NIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Praxial_Music_Education_Reflections_and-sample-pdf.acsm?id=1XI_l4DK9NIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1XI_l4DK9NIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "So4hDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "CjM64dO3GQk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/So4hDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Most Beautiful", "subtitle": "My Life With Prince", "authors": ["Mayte Garcia"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2017-04-06", "description": "In The Most Beautiful, a title inspired by the hit song Prince wrote about their legendary love story, Mayte Garcia for the first time shares the deeply personal story of their relationship and offers a singular perspective on the music icon and their world together: from their unconventional meeting backstage at a concert (and the long-distance romance that followed), to their fairy-tale wedding (and their groundbreaking artistic partnership), to the devastating losses that ultimately dissolved their romantic relationship for good.

Janet Schmalfeldt's ground-breaking account of the development of this Beethoven-Hegelian tradition restores to the term \"form\" some of its philosophical associations in the early nineteenth century, when profound cultural changes were yielding new relationships between composers and their listeners, and when music itself - in particular, instrumental music - became a topic for renewed philosophical investigation. Precedents for Adorno's and Dahlhaus's concept of form as process arise in the Athenaum Fragments of Friedrich Schlegel and in the Encyclopaedia Logic of Hegel. The metaphor common to all these sources is the notion of becoming; it is the idea of form coming into being that this study explores in respectto music by Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Chopin, and Schumann. A critical assessment of Dahlhaus's preoccupation with the opening of Beethoven's \"Tempest\" Sonata serves as the author's starting point for the translation of philosophical ideas into music - analytical terms - ones that encourage listening \"both forward and backward,\" as Adorno has recommended. Thanks to the ever-growing familiarity of late eighteenth-century audiences with formal conventions, composers could increasingly trust that performers and listeners would be responsive to striking formal transformations. The author's analytic method strives to capture the dynamic, quasi-narrative nature of such transformations, rather than only their end results. This experiential approach to the perception of form invites listeners and especially performers to participate in the interpretation of processes by which, for example, a brooding introduction-like opening must inevitably become the essential main theme inSchubert's Sonata, Op. 42, or in which tremendous formal expansions in movements by Mendelssohn offer a dazzling opportunity for multiple retrospective reinterpretations. Above all, In the Process of Becoming proposes new ways of hearing beloved works of the romantic generation as representative of their striving for novel, intensely self-reflective modes of communication.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780195093667"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0195093666"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 333, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=luxpYiInm8YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=luxpYiInm8YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=luxpYiInm8YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=luxpYiInm8YC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/In_the_Process_of_Becoming.html?hl=&id=luxpYiInm8YC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/In_the_Process_of_Becoming-sample-epub.acsm?id=luxpYiInm8YC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=luxpYiInm8YC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "wSYm0cUW6PMC", "etag": "eL30cco9LVc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wSYm0cUW6PMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century", "authors": ["Suzannah Clark", "Alexander Rehding"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2001", "description": "Explores the ways music theory has represented and employed natural order since the scientific revolution.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521771919"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521771917"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 243, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 1, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.1.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wSYm0cUW6PMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wSYm0cUW6PMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wSYm0cUW6PMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wSYm0cUW6PMC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Music_Theory_and_Natural_Order_from_the.html?hl=&id=wSYm0cUW6PMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wSYm0cUW6PMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "fKYgBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "7pUxyIef/Io", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fKYgBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++", "subtitle": "For RackAFX, VST3, and Audio Units", "authors": ["Will Pirkle"], "publisher": "CRC Press", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30", "description": "Bridging the gap from theory to programming, Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++ For RackAFX, VST3 and Audio Units contains complete code for designing and implementing software synthesizers for both Windows and Mac platforms. You will learn synthesizer operation, starting with the underlying theory of each synthesizer component, and moving on to the theory of how these components combine to form fully working musical instruments that function on a variety of target digital audio workstations (DAWs). Containing some of the latest advances in theory and algorithm development, this book contains information that has never been published in textbook form, including several unique algorithms of the author\u2019s own design. The book is broken into three parts: plug-in programming, theory and design of the central synthesizer components of oscillators, envelope generators, and filters, and the design and implementation of six complete polyphonic software synthesizer musical instruments, which can be played in real time. The instruments implement advanced concepts including a user-programmable modulation matrix. The final chapter shows you the theory and code for a suite of delay effects to augment your synthesizers, introducing you to audio effect processing. The companion website, www.focalpress.com/cw/pirkle, gives you access to free software to guide you through the application of concepts discussed in the book, and code for both Windows and Mac platforms.

Liszt's remarkably peripatetic existence creates manifold challenges for the conscientious scholar, but Walker is more than equal to the task. His narrative is copiously footnoted yet never seems to bog down in minutiae. In fact, quite the opposite: the prose is so lively that the reader is often swept along by the narrative. A particularly fascinating section concerns the infamous Cosima Liszt-Hans von Buelow-Richard Wagner triangle, which is skillfully dissected by Walker to separate legend from accurate history. Liszt emerges as an unmistakably generous and self-effacing man in his later years whose prodigious gifts as a composer and pianist were undimmed until the very end. Walker provides frequent musical examples throughout, and his comments on them are not too technical for the general reader. This three-part work, which represents a 25-year labor of love, is now the definitive work on Liszt in English and belongs in all music collections. - from Library Journal.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801484537"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801484537"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 624, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=beP86q3iO6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=beP86q3iO6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=beP86q3iO6MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=82&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=beP86q3iO6MC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Franz_Liszt_The_final_years_1861_1886.html?hl=&id=beP86q3iO6MC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=beP86q3iO6MC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lOOaCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "rUc1GyjMGs4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lOOaCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "How To Make It in the New Music Business: Practical Tips on Building a Loyal Following and Making a Living as a Musician", "authors": ["Ari Herstand"], "publisher": "Liveright Publishing", "publishedDate": "2016-12-20", "description": "\"Ari is at the front of the front.

Today, odds mean nothing and success is not about lucky breaks. It\u2019s about conquering social media, mastering the art of merchandising and simply working harder and being smarter than everyone else. We are living in the midst of an industry renaissance, one that has left the record companies desperately struggling to maintain their prominence, as a subculture of dedicated, DIY (do-it-yourself) musicians have taken over. These days talent is a given and success has to be earned. In 2008, Ari Herstand boldly turned in his green Starbucks apron to his manager, determined to make a living off his craft as a singer/songwriter. Almost a decade later, he has become a founding member of the new DIY movement and a self-sustaining musician, all without the help of a major label. Now, drawing from years of experience, Herstand has written the definitive guide for other like-minded artists, the ones who want to forge their own path and not follow the traditional markers of success, like record sales, hits on the radio or the amount of your label advance. Incredibly comprehensive and brutally honest throughout, How to Make It in the New Music Business covers every facet of the \"new\" business, including how to: Build a grass-roots fan base\u2014and understand the modern fan Book a profitable tour, and tips for playing live, such as opening vs. headlining etiquette, and putting on a memorable show Become popular on YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud Get songs placed in film and television Earn royalties you didn\u2019t know existed and reach your crowdfunding goals Musicians will not only be introduced to all the tools available today but will be shown how to effectively leverage them to actually make money. More important, they will develop the mindset to be aware of new advancements both online and in the real world and always stay in tune with a constantly evolving landscape. There has never been a better time to be an independent musician. Today, fans can communicate with their idols by simply picking up their phones, artists are able to produce studio-worthy content from their basement and albums are funded not by \"record men\" but by generous, engaged supporters. As result, How to Make It in the New Music Business is a must-have guide for anyone hoping to navigate the increasingly complex yet advantageous landscape that is the modern music industry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781631491511"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1631491512"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Performing Arts"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.12.13.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_To_Make_It_in_the_New_Music_Business.html?hl=&id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_To_Make_It_in_the_New_Music_Business-sample-epub.acsm?id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/How_To_Make_It_in_the_New_Music_Business-sample-pdf.acsm?id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lOOaCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "qUziFN5QeKAC", "etag": "5FAbTnQ65ms", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qUziFN5QeKAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Music and Marx", "subtitle": "Ideas, Practice, Politics", "authors": ["Karl Marx"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "2002", "description": "Music and Marx represents the first time a distinctly diverse set of Marxist-directed approaches to the study of music can be found in a single volume.

This insight raises big questions about the nature of music and the nature of humankind, and ethnomusicologists argue that to properly address these questions, we must study music in all its geographical and historical diversity. In this Very Short Introduction, one of the foremost ethnomusicologists, Timothy Rice, offers a compact and illuminating account of this growing discipline, showing how modern researchers go about studying music from around the world, looking for insights into both music and humanity. The reader discovers that ethnomusicologists today not only examine traditional forms of music-such as Japanese gagaku, Bulgarian folk music, Javanese gamelan, or Native American drumming and singing-but also explore more contemporary musical forms, from rap and reggae to Tex-Mex, Serbian turbofolk, and even the piped-in music at the Mall of America. To investigate these diverse musical forms, Rice shows, ethnomusicologists typically live in a community, participate in and observe and record musical events, interview the musicians, their patrons, and the audience, and learn to sing, play, and dance. It's important to establish rapport with musicians and community members, and obtain the permission of those they will work with closely over the course of many months and years. We see how the researcher analyzes the data to understand how a particular musical tradition works, what is distinctive about it, and how it bears the personal, social, and cultural meanings attributed to it. Rice also discusses how researchers may apply theories from anthropology and other social sciences, to shed further light on the nature of music as a human behavior and cultural practice. About the Series: Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199794584"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199794588"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 160, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 223.98, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 156.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UBPNAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 223980000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 156790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ethnomusicology_A_Very_Short_Introductio-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UBPNAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6H0EJSqXWn0C", "etag": "8dtsqXaL704", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6H0EJSqXWn0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "John W.

Not all of their cultural influence can be traced to long hair and flashy clothing; the Beatles had numerous fresh ideas about melody, harmony, counterpoint, rhythm, form, colors, and textures. Or consider how much new ground was broken by their lyrics alone--both the themes and imagery of the Beatles' poetry are key parts of what made (and still makes) this group so important, so popular, and so imitated. This book is a comprehensive chronological study of every aspect of the Fab Four's musical life--including full examinations of composition, performance practice, recording, and historical context--during their transcendent late period (1966-1970).

James H. Johnson recreates the experience of audiences during these rich decades with brio and wit. Woven into the narrative is an analysis of the political, musical, and aesthetic factors that produced more engaged listening. Johnson shows the gradual pacification of audiences from loud and unruly listeners to the attentive public we know today. Drawing from a wide range of sources\u2014novels, memoirs, police files, personal correspondence, newspaper reviews, architectural plans, and the like\u2014Johnson brings the performances to life: the hubbub of eighteenth-century opera, the exuberance of Revolutionary audiences, Napoleon's musical authoritarianism, the bourgeoisie's polite consideration.

Numerous contextual and theoretical insights make it an essential resource for professional, amateur, and student clarinetists. With engaging prose supported by fact-filled analytical charts, the book offers rich biographical information and informative analyses to help clarinetists gain a more complete understanding of Three Pieces for Clarinet Solo by Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland's Concerto for Clarinet, String Orchestra, Harp, and Piano, Robert Schumann's Fantasy Pieces for Clarinet and Piano, Op. 73. and Time Pieces for Clarinet and Piano, Op. 43. by Robert Muczynski, among many others. With close attention to matters of context, style, and harmonic and formal analysis, Albert Rice explores a significant portion of the repertoire, and offers a faithful and comprehensive guide that includes works by Boulez, Brahms, and Mozart to Hindemith, Poulenc, and Stamitz. Rice includes biographical information on each composer and highlights history's impact on the creation and performance of important works for clarinet. Intended as a starting point for connecting performance studies with scholarship, Rice's analysis will help clarinetists gain a more complete picture of a given work. Its valuable insights make it essential to musicians preparing and presenting programs, and its detailed historical information about the work and composer will encourage readers to explore other works in a similarly analytical way.

Adorno and Arthur C. Danto. Aesthetic theory, she argues, depends on a dynamic philosophy of history centered on tendencies, yearnings, needs, and potentialities. With this in mind, she recasts the theses of Adorno and Danto regarding the death or end of philosophy, art, music, and human experience as arguments for continuation and survival.

Walker sets out to dispel the many myths and legends that continue to surround Chopin. Fryderyk Chopin is an intimate look into a dramatic life; of particular focus are Chopin's childhood and youth in Poland, which are brought into line with Walker's latest scholarly findings, and Chopin's romantic life with George Sand, with whom he lived for nine years. Comprehensive and engaging, and written in highly readable prose, the biography wears its scholarship lightly: this is a book suited as much for the professional pianist as it is for the casual music lover.

I am not a \"rock star,\" nor have I ever been on tour and performed in front of 50,000 screaming fans, but I have played in a band as a singer/guitarist at thousands of weddings and clubs, played at thousands of solo dates as a singer/guitarist (which I still do at the present time of this writing), backed up several stars, written over 100 songs, released 8 albums, signed with 2 independent record labels out of California in my 50's, and I also am currently an independent \"recording artist,\" which to this date has placed me in the \"Top 200 Worldwide Radio Play Charts\" for independent and major", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781937520762"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1937520765"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 71, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B_HtFji2zCEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 322.14, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 225.5, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&rdid=book-B_HtFji2zCEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 322140000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 225500000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Making_Music_Money_Memories-sample-epub.acsm?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Making_Music_Money_Memories-sample-pdf.acsm?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=B_HtFji2zCEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "e03al4R3s04C", "etag": "kCe5jwGD7pk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/e03al4R3s04C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Writings on Music, 1965-2000", "authors": ["Steve Reich"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "publishedDate": "2002-04-11", "description": "In the mid-1960s, Steve Reich radically renewed the musical landscape with a back-to-basics sound that came to be called Minimalism. These early works, characterized by a relentless pulse and static harmony, focused single-mindedly on the process of gradual rhythmic change. Throughout his career, Reich has continued to reinvigorate the music world, drawing from a wide array of classical, popular, sacred, and non-western idioms. His works reflect the steady evolution of an original musical mind. Writings on Music documents the creative journey of this thoughtful, groundbreaking composer. These 64 short pieces include Reich's 1968 essay \"Music as a Gradual Process,\" widely considered one of the most influential pieces of music theory in the second half of the 20th century. Subsequent essays, articles, and interviews treat Reich's early work with tape and phase shifting, showing its development into more recent work with speech melody and instrumental music. Other essays recount his exposure to non-western music -- African drumming, Balinese gamelan, Hebrew cantillation -- and the influence of these musics as structures and not as sounds. The writings include Reich's reactions to and appreciations of the works of his contemporaries (John Cage, Luciano Berio, Morton Feldman, Gyorgy Ligeti) and older influences (Kurt Weill, Schoenberg). Each major work of the composer's career is also explored through notes written for performances and recordings. Paul Hillier, himself a respected figure in the early music and new music worlds, has revisited these texts, working with the author to clarify their central narrative: the aesthetic and intellectual development of an influential composer. For long-time listeners and young musicians recently introduced to his work, this book provides an opportunity to get to know Reich's music in greater depth and perspective.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0195354788"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780195354782"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.5.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e03al4R3s04C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e03al4R3s04C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=e03al4R3s04C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e03al4R3s04C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e03al4R3s04C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 714.3, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 357.15, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e03al4R3s04C&rdid=book-e03al4R3s04C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 714300000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 357150000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Writings_on_Music_1965_2000-sample-epub.acsm?id=e03al4R3s04C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Writings_on_Music_1965_2000-sample-pdf.acsm?id=e03al4R3s04C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=e03al4R3s04C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FjpcUKa0KH4C", "etag": "MXWkbpeDJbA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FjpcUKa0KH4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "African Music", "subtitle": "Traditional and Contemporary", "authors": ["Alexander Akorlie Agordoh"], "publisher": "Nova Publishers", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "It is customary in the Western world for people to use the term 'African music' as if it were a single clearly identifiable phenomenon.

They cover various aspects of Berlioz's life and works and represent an important contribution to Berlioz research. The book includes essays based on documents, both biographical and musical, that give us, among other things, a portrait of the artist as a young man and a revealing view of an important but little-studied work of his maturity. There are readings of Romeo et Juliette and La Damnation de Faust that wrestle anew with the problems of the relationships between literature and music and - as Berlioz's music nearly always requires - with the problems of genre. Two views of Berlioz's Les Nuits d'\u00e9t\u00e9 are presented which ask when and why the work was conceived, and how the work coheres. The practical question of Berlioz's metronome marks are here thoroughly studied for the first time. The volume closes with a novel piece, in dialogue form, by the elder statesman of Berlioz scholars, Jacques Barzun, who treats with exceptional grace the profound issues raised by Berlioz the man and musician.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521028566"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521028561"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 300, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9IMLGQeTmDoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9IMLGQeTmDoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9IMLGQeTmDoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=114&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9IMLGQeTmDoC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Berlioz_Studies.html?hl=&id=9IMLGQeTmDoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9IMLGQeTmDoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lYyZc8LZQoMC", "etag": "2dLtYSFm6yo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lYyZc8LZQoMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Hip Hop's Inheritance", "subtitle": "From the Harlem Renaissance to the Hip Hop Feminist Movement", "authors": ["Reiland Rabaka"], "publisher": "Lexington Books", "publishedDate": "2011-03-31", "description": "Hip Hop's Inheritance arguably offers the first book-length treatment of what hip hop culture has, literally, 'inherited' from the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts movement, the Feminist Art movement, and 1980s and 1990s postmodern aesthetics.

Just after the turn of the century, New Orleanians could often hear Bolden\u2019s powerful horn from the city\u2019s parks and through dance hall windows. Despite his lack of formal training, his unique style\u2014both musical and personal\u2014made him the first \u201cking\u201d of New Orleans jazz and the inspiration for such later jazz greats as King Oliver, Kid Ory, and Louis Armstrong. For years the legend of Buddy Bolden was overshadowed by myths about his music, his reckless lifestyle, and his mental instability. In Search of Buddy Bolden overlays the myths with the substance of reality. Interviews with those who knew Bolden and an extensive array of primary sources enliven and inform Donald M. Marquis\u2019s absorbing portrait of the brief but brilliant career of the first man of jazz.

While emphasizing stylistic analysis and historical development, he also treats the diverse popular musics as sites for the negotiation and mediation of the dialectics of nationalism and acculturation, tradition and modernity, urban and rural aesthetics, and grassroots spontaneity and corporate or bureaucratic manipulation. --From publisher's description.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0195063341"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780195063349"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 287, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Music&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&dq=subject:Music&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Popular_Musics_of_the_Non_Western_World.html?hl=&id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Popular_Musics_of_the_Non_Western_World-sample-epub.acsm?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xHziAwAAQBAJ", "etag": "oLoT+3GLuRQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xHziAwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Complete Recorded Works in Transcription", "authors": ["Sam Morgan's Jazz Band"], "publisher": "A-R Editions, Inc.", "publishedDate": "2012-01-01", "description": "Book URL: https://www.areditions.com/rr/rra/a073.html This edition consists of musical transcriptions of all eight recordings of Sam Morgan\u00bfs Jazz Band, made in New Orleans in 1927.

It is a loosely integrated, purely linear ensemble mass, a collective projecting of melodic lines close to the unassimilated heterophonic singing of the Black Primitive Baptist and Sanctified Churches. This proto jazz style was being rapidly eclipsed in the 1920s by more flamboyant and technically brilliant forms of New Orleans jazz being recorded by Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and Jelly Roll Morton.
