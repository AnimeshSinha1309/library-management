It is the chemistry of radioactive elements such as the actinides, radium and radon together with the chemistry associated with equipment (such as nuclear reactors) which are designed to perform nuclear processes. This includes the corrosion of surfaces and the behaviour under conditions of both normal and abnormal operation (such as during an accident). An important area is the behaviour of objects and materials after being placed into a waste store or otherwise composed of the study of the chemical effects resulting from the absorption of radiation within living animals, plants, and other materials. The radiation chemistry controls much of radiation biology as radiation has an effect on living things at the molecular scale, to explain it another way the radiation alters the biochemicals within an organism, the alteration of the biomolecules then changes the chemistry which occurs within the organism, this change in biochemistry then can lead to a biological outcome. As a result nuclear chemistry greatly assists the understanding of medical treatments (such as cancer radiotherapy) and has enabled these treatments to improve.the study of the production and use of radioactive sources for a range of processes. These include radiotherapy in medical applications; the use of radioactive tracers within industry, science and the environment; and the use of radiation to modify materials such as polymers, the study and use of nuclear processes in non-radioactive areas of human activity.

This volume is comprised of six chapters and begins by discussing the origin of the atomic theory, focusing on the role of John Dalton, Avogadro's hypothesis, and the introduction to the laws of chemical combination. The chapters that follow look at the work of the early scientists that led to the development of the periodic table of elements; the use of the Avogadro number to determine the actual masses of atoms and molecules; and the structure of the atom. The essential results of the simple wave mechanical treatment are summarized in the next chapter. This book concludes by considering developments in the determination of atomic weights. Some brief notes on the character and personality of the great scientists who are mentioned throughout the text are included.

Choppin"], "publishedDate": "1995", "description": "Nuclear chemistry comprises isotope chemistry, radiochemistry, radiation chemistry and nuclear reaction chemistry, along with applications. These interrelated fields are all covered in this textbook for chemists and chemical engineers. This new edition of the standard work 'Nuclear Chemistry' has been completely rewritten and restructured to suit teaching and learning needs in a wide range of chemistry courses, such as basic courses in radiochemistry, or more advanced nuclear chemistry courses. The book is divided into sections that closely fit teaching demands. The first chapter gives a broad introduction and background to the subject, and the second chapter covers stable isotopes. Chapters 3 to 9 comprise what is generally regarded as 'radiochemistry'. Chapters 10 to 17 offer a course in nuclear reaction chemistry. Chapter 18 deals with biological radiation effects for the chemist. The last four chapters give a guide to nuclear energy: energy production, fuel cycle, waste management, the largest applied field of nuclear chemistry. Over 200 exercises, with model answers, remain largely unchanged from the first edition, so teachers working from the earlier text should find only advantages in switching to this new restructured course book on all aspects of nuclear chemistry. 'The book fully meets the authors objectives, it is well written in a logical, objective, thought-provoking and quite easily readable style. It should appeal to the serious student of radio- and nuclear chemistry at either undergraduate or postgraduate level, as well as to readers with a more general interest in nuclear science and its impact on the environment.' - Applied Radiation and Isotopes, July 1995 'This book is an excellent, readable account of a significant part of the scientific achievements of more than half this century. The authors have dedicated the book to Nobel Laureate Glenn T. Seaborg and its scholarship makes it a fitting tribute.' - Radiological Protection Bulletin, December 1995", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "UCSD:31822020469888"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 707, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nuclear chemistry"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pANDAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pANDAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pANDAQAAIAAJ&q=Nuclear+chemistry&dq=Nuclear+chemistry&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pANDAQAAIAAJ&dq=Nuclear+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Radiochemistry_and_Nuclear_Chemistry.html?hl=&id=pANDAQAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pANDAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This new edition of the standard work &#39;Nuclear Chemistry&#39; has been completely rewritten and restructured to suit teaching and learning needs in a wide range of chemistry courses, such as basic courses in radiochemistry, or more advanced ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8LO9Cl12ARAC", "etag": "VJoDtMqaZyg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8LO9Cl12ARAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Principles of American Nuclear Chemistry", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["Thomas McMahon"], "publisher": "University of Chicago Press", "publishedDate": "2010-08-15", "description": "What was life like for the scientists working at Los Alamos?

Lewis", "Albert D. Windhorst", "Brian M. Zeglis"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2019-04-02", "description": "This book is a comprehensive guide to radiopharmaceutical chemistry. The stunning clinical successes of nuclear imaging and targeted radiotherapy have resulted in rapid growth in the field of radiopharmaceutical chemistry, an essential component of nuclear medicine and radiology. However, at this point, interest in the field outpaces the academic and educational infrastructure needed to train radiopharmaceutical chemists. For example, the vast majority of texts that address radiopharmaceutical chemistry do so only peripherally, focusing instead on nuclear chemistry (i.e. nuclear reactions in reactors), heavy element radiochemistry (i.e. the decomposition of radioactive waste), or solely on the clinical applications of radiopharmaceuticals (e.g. the use of PET tracers in oncology). This text fills that gap by focusing on the chemistry of radiopharmaceuticals, with key coverage of how that knowledge translates to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for the clinic. The text is divided into three overarching sections: First Principles, Radiochemistry, and Special Topics. The first is a general overview covering fundamental and broad issues like \u201cThe Production of Radionuclides\u201d and \u201cBasics of Radiochemistry\u201d. The second section is the main focus of the book. In this section, each chapter\u2019s author will delve much deeper into the subject matter, covering both well established and state-of-the-art techniques in radiopharmaceutical chemistry.

Assuring a Future U.S.-Based Nuclear and Radiochemistry Expertise examines supply and demand for expertise in nuclear chemistry nuclear science, and radiochemistry in the United States and presents possible approaches for ensuring adequate availability of these skills, including necessary science and technology training platforms. Considering a range of reasonable scenarios looking to the future, none of these areas are likely to experience a decrease in demand for expertise. However, many in the current workforce are approaching retirement age and the number of students opting for careers in nuclear and radiochemistry has decreased dramatically over the past few decades. In order to avoid a gap in these critical areas, increases in student interest in these careers, in the research and educational capacity of universities and colleges, and sector specific on-the-job training will be needed.

Other chapters consider Dalton's conception of an atom as a hard dense sphere. This book discusses as well the significant results of the simple wave mechanical treatment. The final chapter deals with the determination of the Avogadro's number, which enabled the actual masses of atoms and molecules to be determined.

Topics covered range from wave mechanics and chemical bonding to molecular spectroscopy and photochemistry; ideal and nonideal gases; the three laws of thermodynamics; thermochemistry; and solutions of nonelectrolytes. The kinetics of gas-phase reactions; colloids and macromolecules; and nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry are also discussed. This edition is comprised of 22 chapters; the first of which introduces the reader to the behavior of ideal and nonideal gases, with particular emphasis on the van der Waals equation. The discussion then turns to the kinetic molecular theory of gases and the application of the Boltzmann principle to the treatment of molar polarization; dipole and magnetic moments; the phenomenology of light absorption; and classical and statistical thermodynamics. The chapters that follow focus on the traditional sequence of chemical and phase equilibria, electrochemistry, and chemical kinetics in gas phase and solution phase. This book also considers wave mechanics and its applications; molecular spectroscopy and photochemistry; and the excited state, and then concludes with an analysis of crystal structure, colloid and polymer chemistry, and radio and nuclear chemistry.

This first book on the subject gives a thorough description of the various aspects that affect the development of the topic and details the interdisciplinary applications. The book starts with a section dedicated to the basic theories of long-lived spin order and then proceeds with a description of the state-of-the-art experimental techniques developed to manipulate singlet order.

Hospital resource utilization must be a consideration. Even the pathologist performing autopsies needs adequate preparation. It is with these considerations in mind that the Handbook of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Agent Exposures was created. Taking a concise yet comprehensive, clinical approach to the treatment of these exposures, the authors provide concise information on radiation substances, biological agents, chemical toxins, laboratory tests, and antidotes. The book includes essays on topics such as Field Identification and Decontamination of Toxins, Bioterrorism and the Skin, and Mass Exposures Involving the Pediatric Population.

Meitner was a colleague and friend of many giants of 20th century physics: Max Planck, her Berlin mentor, Einstein, von Laue, Marie Curie, Chadwick, Pauli and Bohr. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Vienna, a pioneer in the research of radioactive processes and, together with her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, an interpreter of the process of nuclear fission in 1938. Yet at the end of World War II, her colleague of thirty years, radiochemist Otto Hahn alone was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of nuclear fission \u2014 a discovery based on years of research in which Meitner was directly involved before her secret 1938 escape from Nazi Germany to Sweden. \u201cA story of one of the half dozen most remarkable women of the 20th century.\u201d \u2014 John Archibald Wheeler, Princeton University \u201cPatricia Rife\u2019s biography truly brings Meitner to life, both as a scientist and as a woman... Rife weaves Meitner\u2019s personal struggles into the social and political fabric of her times. For example, the story of Meitner\u2019s early career is told against the backdrop of the development of the new physics, with plentiful illumination of the limited prospects for women scientists in the German-speaking world during the early twentieth century. When Meitner's story enters the Nazi era \u2014 including her escape from Germany \u2014 it is as riveting as the best novel.\u201d \u2014 Catherine Westfall,Technology and Culture \u201cA well-written, thorough, readable and engrossing work.\u201d \u2014 Gary Goldstein, Peace and Change: a Journal of Peace Research \u201cRife has produced an exciting book, which reads like a novel and she gives justice to Meitner\u2019s life full of science and human stories... [The] book is a beautiful tribute to an outstanding scientist; it has a lot to teach us about our world; and it is a great read. I warmly recommend it to everyone interested in science and in history.\u201d \u2014 Structural Chemistry \u201cLise Meitner comes to life as author Rife skillfully weaves social, political, and scientific events into a well-researched and documented work. Lists of Meitner\u2019s awards and publications and an extensive bibliography complete this excellent book.\u201d \u2014 Association of Women in Science Magazine \u201cThe dramatic tale of the discovery of nuclear fission on the eve of WWII... not just a story of ideas... but also of the social and intellectual milieu in which these ideas were developed. It is also the story of how a shy, self-effacing young woman, through talent and hard work, became a world-class scientist... Rife tells this story very well.\u201d \u2014 The Antioch Review \u201cThe particular merit of Rife\u2019s biography of Austrian physicist Meitner is that it places her life and work within the historical context... It is comprehensive, generally clearly written... and appropriate for undergraduate students. Just enough science is included as to make clear the significance of her work...

Both have occurred for this book during the past 7 years since its second edition. The growth and development in nuclear pharmacy and radiopharmaceutical chemistry along with the continued success of the book have convinced us to update the book; hence this third edition. This book is a ramification of my nuclear pharmacy courses offered to pharmacy students specializing in nuclear pharmacy, nuclear medicine resi dents, and nuclear medicine technology students. The book is written in an integrated form from the basic concept of atomic structure to the practical clinical uses of radiopharmaceuticals. It serves both as a textbook on nu clear pharmacy for pharmacy students and nuclear medicine technologists, and as a useful reference book for many professionals related to nuclear medicine, such as nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists. The book contains 12 chapters. Each chapter is written as comprehen sively as possible based on my personal experience and understanding. At the end of each chapter, a section of pertinent questions and problems and so me suggested reading materials are included. I have made justifiably many additions and deletions as weIl as some reorganization in this edition. Chapter 3 is entirely dedicated to instru ments for radiation detection and measurement, including brief description of gas detectors, gamma-detecting instruments, and tomographic scanners.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781475740271"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1475740271"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 331, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nuclear+chemistry&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-MxysBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Fundamentals_of_Nuclear_Pharmacy-sample-epub.acsm?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Fundamentals_of_Nuclear_Pharmacy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MxysBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A new edition of a book is warranted when the book is successful and there are many new developments in the related discipline.

As an introductory text on NBC CBRN weapons and agents, this book leads the reader from the scientific basics to the current threats and strategies to prepare against them. After an introductory part on the history of NBC CBRN weapons and their international control, the three classes of nuclear/radiological, biological, and chemical weapons are introduced, focusing on agents and delivery vehicles. Current methods for the rapid detection of NBC CBRN agents are introduced, and the principles of physical protection of humans and structures are explained. The final parts addresses more general issues of risk management, preparedness and response management, as the set of tools that authorities and civil services will be needed in a future CBRN scenario as well as the likely future scenarios that authorities and civil services will be faced with in the coming years.

Besides providing a theoretical description of the physical phenomena, a large part of the book is devoted to applications in the medical and biological field, particularly in haematology, forensic medicine and environmental science. Analysis of the elemental composition of human tissues and cells and in particular trace elements has attracted increasing interest over the last few years, due to the increase in knowledge on the role of some elements and the possible correlations between abnormal concentrations of one or more trace elements and pathological conditions. This has stimulated the development of analytical techniques which allow the detection of trace elements simultaneously and at very low concentrations. Particularly in methods involving nuclear principles or nuclear apparatus, many techniques have been largely and successfully developed in recent years and applied in the medical field. This volume reviews methods such as the possibility of carrying out rapid multi-element analysis of trace elements on biomedical samples, in vitro and in vivo, by XRF-analysis; the ability of the PIXE-microprobe to analyze in detail and to map trace elements in fragments of biomedical samples or inside the cells; the potentiality of in vivo nuclear activation analysis for diagnostic purposes. Finally, techniques are described such as radiation scattering (elastic and inelastic scattering) and attenuation measurements which will undoubtedly see great development in the immediate future.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0080875564"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780080875569"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 403, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.6.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nuclear+chemistry&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eVFspUR1e_0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22648.92, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22648.92, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&rdid=book-eVFspUR1e_0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22648920000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22648920000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nuclear_Analytical_Techniques_in_Medicin-sample-epub.acsm?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Nuclear_Analytical_Techniques_in_Medicin-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eVFspUR1e_0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book will acquaint the interested physician or physicist with the fundamental principles and the instrumentation relevant to analytical techniques based on atomic and nuclear physics, as well as present and future biomedical ..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Jv2PDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "OTUi7pXO5Oo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Jv2PDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Radon", "authors": ["Feriz Adrovic"], "publisher": "BoD \u2013 Books on Demand", "publishedDate": "2017-11-29", "description": "In the book Radon, some segments of modern research from a wide range of issues related to radioactive gas radon are presented.

As a result, basic research on fullerenes has generated new knowledge as published in thousands of journal papers. The nuclear and radiation approaches, however, have been somewhat neglected in books dedicated to fullerene sciences, although these approaches have generated very interesting knowledge on the structure and composition of these new all-carbon molecules. This monograph intends to bridge this gap by dealing with the various aspects of nuclear sciences as applied to the generation of new knowledge in fullerene sciences. Ten chapters appear in this volume and were chosen to present a panoramic view and to provide theoretical perspectives, research methods, and experimental results on the topic. This book will serve both as an introduction to the subfield and as an aid to setting an agenda for scientists interested in this area of research.

Since the 1990's when the first structures were determined by means of X ray diffraction, the number of NR structures has increased considerably. Moreover several 'omics' projects (genomics, pharmcogenomics and proteomics) have opened up great opportunities for the discovery of new targets, the characterization of abnormal protein patterns, the selection of \"tailored\" drugs and the evaluation of drug efficacy even with a lack of structural data. Furthermore, structure-based drug design, computational methods for in silico screening and nanobiotechnology- based tools are simplifying this time-consuming and money-intensive research of lead compounds and, possibly, new drugs. Biological interactions such as those that occur between a protein and ligand are concerted events where flexible molecules interact. Thus understanding flexibility of large molecules or biological complexes is of primary importance to help define the right model to approximate the reality for drug discovery, virtual screening, food safety analysis, etc. NRs are known as flexible targets, with many structural similarities, in particular for their Ligand Binding Domain: these similarities could be assumed to share behavioural qualities that belong to this class of compounds. Thus to supply a possible, complete and exhaustive answer to questions about the behaviour of NRs, their interactions with new potential drugs, endocrine disruptors such as animal and human food toxins, food additives or industry residuals, it is mandatory to approach the problem from a different point of view: a molecular modelling approach, steered synthesis, and in vitro and in vivo tests, etc. The aim of this book is to provide a state of the art review on investigations into Nuclear Receptors.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781849735353"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1849735352"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 300, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nuclear+chemistry&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15120.36, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15120.36, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UHMoDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15120360000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15120360000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Computational_Approaches_to_Nuclear_Rece-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UHMoDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The aim of this book is to provide a state of the art review on investigations into Nuclear Receptors.

This book comprises eight chapters, and begins with a focus on nuclear spin-lattice relaxation. The following chapters then discuss mechanisms of spin-lattice relaxation; the nuclear overhauser effect in rigid molecules; the effects of internal motions; experimental methods; transient methods; the effects of chemical exchange; and applications of the nuclear overhauser effect, with a review of available literature.

This book reviews the chemistry of inorganic substances as the science of matter, the units of measure used, atoms, atomic structure, thermochemistry, nuclear chemistry, molecules, and ions in action. This text also describes the chemical bonds, the representative elements, the changes of state, water and the hydrosphere (which also covers water pollution and water purification). Water purification occurs in nature through the usual water cycle and by the action of microorganisms. The air flushes dissolved gases and volatile pollutants; when water seeps through the soil, it filters solids as they settle in the bottom of placid lakes.

The chapters review the current status of the field and present the future opportunities in utilizing radiation chemical techniques. This will be of interest to chemists in general and in particular to radiation chemists, chemical kineticists, photochemists, physical-organic chemists and spectroscopists. In view of the diverse nature of the field, the book is a multi-authored effort by several experts in their particular areas of research. Six main areas, both basic and applied, were identified and the book is organized around them. The topics were selected in terms of their relative importance and the contribution of radiation chemistry to the general areas of chemistry, biology and physics. The topics covered are as diverse as gas phase radiation chemistry, the use of radiation chemical techniques, the treatment of water pollutants, the chemical basis of radiation biology, and muonium chemistry.

Each review within the volume critically surveys one aspect of that topic and places it within the context of the volume as a whole. The most significant developments of the last 5 to 10 years are presented using selected examples to illustrate the principles discussed. The coverage is not intended to be an exhaustive summary of the field or include large quantities of data, but should rather be conceptual, concentrating on the methodological thinking that will allow the non-specialist reader to understand the information presented. Contributions also offer an outlook on potential future developments in the field.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319541457"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319541455"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 297, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nuclear+chemistry&hl=&cd=111&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 23600, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rjFIDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 23600000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Applications_of_Radiation_Chemistry_in_t-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rjFIDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The series Topics in Current Chemistry Collections presents critical reviews from the journal Topics in Current Chemistry organized in topical volumes."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "q14rhaV_o1MC", "etag": "9wLu+lkYj3I", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/q14rhaV_o1MC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Technological Innovations in Sensing and Detection of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear Threats and Ecological Terrorism", "authors": ["Ashok Vaseashta", "Eric Braman", "Philip Susmann"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-01-05", "description": "This book arises from the NATO Advanced Study Institute \u201cTechnological Innovations in Detection and Sensing of CBRN Agents and Ecological Terrorism\u201d held in Chisinau, Republic of Moldova in June 2010.
