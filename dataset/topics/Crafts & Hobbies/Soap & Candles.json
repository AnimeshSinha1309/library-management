It is written from the perspective of a Cosmetic Formulator on the production of the popular cosmetic base known as, Melt and Pour Soap. Whether you are a crafter, hobbyist or business owner this book has everything that you need. This book give you guidance on how, as a small home based business, you can follow the regulations, labeling laws and industry standards for selling soap and cosmetics. My entire journey into the cosmetic industry started with Melt and Pour Soap shortly after I discovered aromatherapy. The roots of our business, Essential Wholesale, all started in December of 1998. Over the years we moved from our home kitchenette to a 600 square foot space, to a 2500 square foot building, to a 10,000 square foot space in a bigger building, and from there we have expanded into 30,000 square feet of that same building. In 2011 our business will be moving to an even larger 58,000 square foot building. As our business expanded we began to focus on natural cosmetics and personal care products. However, I never lost my curiosity and fascination with Melt and Pour Soap. Our relationship with Melt and Pour Soap changed over the years. At first we sold retail customized Melt and Pour Soaps. We then bought and sold the company Critter Soaps. Later we sold thousands of pounds worth of wholesale Melt and Pour Soap base and eventually discontinued selling Melt and Pour Soap because the price kept rising. At the time Melt and Pour Soap was the only cosmetic base we sold that we didn't manufacture ourselves. It simply didn't make sense to wholesale someone else's base when our business model had changed to selling only the bases we manufactured ourselves. It was at this point in our business that I decided it was time to formulate our own Melt and Pour Soap ourselves. It didn't take long to have working formulas, but at that moment we were using up every inch of space in our 30,000 square foot building. We were bursting at the seams and couldn't accommodate the manufacturing and cooling of the Melt and Pour Soap Base in bulk. Our space was so tight we couldn't possibly cool an 8,000 lb batch of Melt and Pour Soap base into multiple 1 lb, 20 lb and 40 lb blocks to sell in bulk. But we got continued requests to manufacture and sell Melt and Pour Soap base. My solution is this book. I decided to share these basic recipes with you to give you the freedom to make your own Melt and Pour base in the quantities that work best for your business. These recipes will teach you the foundational information that you need and give you tips on how to customize your base.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0615481116"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780615481111"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 107, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Crafts & Hobbies"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5PqGZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5PqGZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5PqGZwEACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5PqGZwEACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Make_Melt_and_Pour_Soap_Base_from.html?hl=&id=5PqGZwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5PqGZwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VAVIzAEACAAJ", "etag": "mV4okNVEmh0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VAVIzAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Easy Soaps", "subtitle": "Learn How to Make Soap with Different Beautiful Bath and Laundry Soaps to Make Yourself (100 Easy Soap Recipes)", "authors": ["Carrie Anderson"], "publisher": "Independently Published", "publishedDate": "2019-11-28", "description": "EASY SOAPS Learn How to Make Soap with Different Beautiful Bath and Laundry Soaps to Make Yourself 100 Easy Soap Recipes! with full images of the recipes Know how to make different varieties of soaps, with over 100 quick and easy recipes to make!

There are only three essential ingredients required to create these soaps: water, olive oil, and caustic soda. Olive oil is the primary ingredient enjoying the highest rating as its properties are well known throughout the world. Olive oil is the most beneficial oil to your health, and in cosmetics it has been used since ancient times for its virtues for glowing hair and skin. Rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins it has the added benefit of being available virtually everywhere. Once these three key ingredients are in place, there are a number of wonderful extra ingredients that will customize and create a personal soap. These ingredients include beeswax, cocoa butter, clay, kaolin, seaweed, goats milk and egg yolks, and others. Some ingredients will give the soap hardness (beeswax) or softness (honey) or more foam (cocoa butter) for greater cleansing ability. Since using soap is such a sensory experience, there is a comprehensive section on essential oils which create that air of perpetual breeze of a good soap. A comprehensive section on these essential oils, their history and therapeutic uses provide all the information needed to create the perfect scent. The recipes feature essential oils of the highest purity which are added to the soap right before it is placed in molds. Easy step-by-step preparation techniques produce luxurious soaps such as: Sandalwood Soap, Kiwi Soap, Chocolate Soap, Wheat Germ Soap, Green Tea Soap, Cedar Soap, Echinacea Soap, Lavender Soap, Marshmallow Soap, Lemon Soap, Rose Hip Soap, Marigold Soap, Coconut Soap, Vanilla Soap, Seaweed Soap, Oat Soap, Clay Soap, Mung Bean Soap, After Eight Soap, Beach Sand Soap. This fascinating history of soap and its ingredients with therapeutic recommendations is informative and fun to read. The comprehensive recipes with preparation, utensil and ingredient tips guide the reader to create better-than-store-bought quality soaps made at home.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10",

A city kid, Katie Normet discovered a fascination for large animals early in her life, one that led her to study animal sciences at one of Canada's most distinguished agricultural colleges. While there, Normet rubbed shoulders with fellow classmates from farming backgrounds and caught another bug: the urge to make a living raising animals. Today, she and her family run River's Edge Dairy in Central Ontario, where Katie oversees a herd of some 75 goats which produce more than 50,000 liters of milk a year. Much of this milk is transformed into delicious yogurt, cheeses and unique goat-butter tarts, as well as soaps and moisturizing creams, which Normet sells directly from the farm and at local markets. Raising and Keeping Dairy Goats is Normet's account of the daily challenges and rewards of life as a goat farmer, from her experience rehabilitating a farm from the ground up to learning firsthand the ins and outs of acquiring and caring for goats. Normet's central piece of advice runs through her book like a commandment: Know your goat. Keeping eyes on each goat and noting even subtle changes in behavior and demeanor are key to managing a problem quickly and keeping your goat healthy. Normet explores all the big-picture issues in goat husbandry, including: Purchasing Housing Feeding Breeding Kidding Milking Identifying and treating diseases and ailments. There are also chapters on cheese making and soap making with tips and recipes. While the author doesn't gloss over the responsibilities of early-morning milkings and late-night kidding dramas, she deftly communicates the innate appeal of one of nature's most charming and charismatic domesticated animals. For Normet, every inconvenience is a blessing in disguise, and whether readers are preparing to launch their own commercial enterprise or simply interested in providing goat milk for their family, her story will serve as a reliable guide.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1770859799"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781770859791"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2GviAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2GviAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2GviAQAACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2GviAQAACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Raising_and_Keeping_Dairy_Goats.html?hl=&id=2GviAQAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2GviAQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FPTItAEACAAJ", "etag": "/xvlM4bNhbY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FPTItAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Diy Natural Melt and Pour Soap Crafting", "subtitle": "Ultimate Guide to Making & Selling Colorful Natural Soaps", "authors": ["Molly Barrett"], "publisher": "Createspace Independent Publishing Platform", "publishedDate": "2017-10-13", "description": "DIY Natural Melt and Pour Soap Crafting Ultimate Guide to Making & Selling Colorful Natural Soaps Paraben, Sulfate and Triclosan are some of the ingredients in commercial soap that I never questioned until I began making soap at home. That's when my curiosity got the best of me. After finding just these three, I wanted to call a truce to look for dangerous additives in what I used (and worse yet, my children used) to clean. That's when I thought I found the fourth one. Fragrance! How in the world could something that sounds as harmless as fragrance possibly damage your skin? How wrong I was. The definition of fragrance was a far cry in meaning than the one on the soap label. I began making soap because it was a fun hobby I could share with my children. I continued because it morphed into a successful small business. But I'm now compelled to continue knowing that I'm contributing to the health of my family. Before we get into the actual soap making, I do share my findings about just these four potentially harmful ingredients found in too many soaps and body washes. I am sure you will be shocked to read it. But let's move on and talk about what more is in this book. I wanted to arrange the chapters in a logical order. So you are not confused as I was when I first started. I start off with what and how commercial soap can harm you and your family, I dug deep and found out the truth. Then I explain all three soap making process and why Melt and Pour method is the best and easiest to use. Next, I show you what supplies and equipment you will need and their approximate cost. In the next chapter I guide you through a step by step soap making process (chapter 4). After that we discuss everything under the sun about molds you can use and all of their different variations and types (chapter 5). Chapter 6 is all about adding colors and how to use the color wheel. Next up is essential oils which give your soap its scent and a great natural healing power (Chapter 7). After that it is all about my favorite recipes (chapter 8), next I share 15 soap coloring tricks that may truly surprise you, yes they are that good really! (chapter 9). And lastly, in chapter 10, it is all about how to start, run and grow your soap business right from home. After reading the book, you will become a master on how to make homemade soap using melt pour soap making method. You will also learn about all soap making supplies, my favorite soap making recipes and most importantly you will know the difference between store bought commercial soap vs. all natural and organic soap made right at home.

Making soap is not a rocket science, with just a handful of ingredients you can make a variety of soaps right at home. But there is no such book that shows you how to make your homemade soap dazzle with vibrant colors and has truly sensual aroma. Soap that is like no other handmade soaps, soap that stands out among every other soap not only for their rich and lush color but for their aromatic scent that is as natural and healing as pure essential oil. Yes! In this book, my primary goal is to show you the ways you can make your home creations vibrantly colorful and uniquely aromatic that all your senses would wake up and salute your creativity. Most importantly, your creations will stand out among all the other home-based soap makers, and everyone will be able to identify your unique blend of color and aroma. Anyone can learn and make some soaps at home in just a few hours, but if you are planning to sell your soap at the local craft store or make gift baskets or even trying to build a brand around it, don't you want your creation to be unique that when people see them, smell them they will know right away that is yours and yours only? Think about a brand such as Armani or Angel, when you smell their perfume; you may identify them right away by their name. Similarly, when you see a Burberry scarf or a handbag, you will know right away that it is a Burberry right? How? Because they have something unique about their look or aroma. In soap making, we are lucky; we don't have to pick one or the other, we can have both aroma and color to make our own soaps uniquely distinguish and different from the rest. Once you achieve that uniqueness, you just created a brand all for yourself. Adding color or adding scents to your soap is an art and in this book, I show you how to be that artist. It is again not a rocket science, as long as you understand the basics of color wheels and the essential oil and how they act and react with each other, you will become the master soap crafter. This Book is Divided into Three Parts. In Part -1: I start with the basics of soap making using the 3 most popular methods. I show you the ingredients and the equipment you will need to get started and lastly I shared a few basic soap making recipes. In Part -2: I show you how to add rich and lush colors to your soap. This part is where the fun starts. Pay attention to the color wheel images so you can visualize various colors. You will learn how to add color from all natural herbs, plants, and other naturally sourced ingredients. This is also where you will learn, how to mix and match colors and how to create various color combinations. In Part -3: In this last part, my goal is to show you how to make your soap smell heavenly. We will do it all with all natural and therapeutic healing essential oil and other natural herbs only, no artificial stuff here. This is the section where you will learn what goes into what and what does not. Once you understand the basics, then you can create your own unique scent that is identifiable as yours only.

Ittner clarifies the answer in her introductory chapter, explaining that she intended to \"avoid all animal and petroleum-based products, syntheticcolorants and fragrances.\" That said, the rest is amazingly easy.

Sample recipes include Blue Agave Soap, Wild Rosehips Soap, Double Mint Sage Soap and Dead Sea Mud Spa Bar. The recipes are in tune with today's trends--such as vegan options, shampoo and shaving bars, seasonal soaps such as Pumpkin Spice Soap and soaps highlighting popular ingredients such as goat's milk and sea salt--while still retaining a rustic, old-fashioned feel. Many soapers like to adapt recipes adding their own twist, but the chemistry involved can be a challenge. In addition to the recipes, Jan removes the mystery and shares her expertise, gathered from years of natural soapmaking, on valuable topics such as using plant colorants and herbs, substituting oils, resizing a recipe, making hot versus cold process soap and troubleshooting common issues.

Although written for the beginning soapmaker, even the most seasoned soaper will find inspiration in the rituals and procedures of making magickal soap.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1564146480"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781564146489"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 189, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Body, Mind & Spirit"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6JZ3swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6JZ3swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6JZ3swEACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&cd=62&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6JZ3swEACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Soapmaking.html?hl=&id=6JZ3swEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6JZ3swEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "0KIIAAAAIAAJ", "etag": "W2riHjokYJY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0KIIAAAAIAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Practical Treatise on the Manufacture of Soap and Candles ...", "authors": ["William Theodore Brannt"], "publishedDate": "1888", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "NYPL:33433066402458"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 677, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Candles"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.5.5.0.full.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FREE", "isEbook": true, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&rdid=book-0KIIAAAAIAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api"}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "ALL_PAGES", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": true, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false, "downloadLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Practical_Treatise_on_the_Manufacture.epub?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&hl=&output=epub&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "downloadLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Practical_Treatise_on_the_Manufacture.pdf?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&hl=&output=pdf&sig=ACfU3U0KK2dDoZw3MIRG6-yeLzyq-_Vn1w&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0KIIAAAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "FULL_PUBLIC_DOMAIN", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "XBulpwAACAAJ", "etag": "KMjAayxtyDM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/XBulpwAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "DIY Kitchen Chemistry", "subtitle": "Simple Homemade Bath and Body Projects", "authors": ["Kayla Fioravanti"], "publisher": "Selah Press, LLC", "publishedDate": "2011-12-01", "description": "DIY Kitchen Chemistry is filled with simple to follow do-it-yourself bath and body product recipes.

ASK ON HER WEB SITE, AND YOU'LL NORMALLY HEAR BACK WITHIN HOURS! Soapmakers may love to add a variety of materials to soap, but they find that some cause more trouble than others. In the heat of the chemical reaction, an ingredient might discolor, or lose its scent, or develop a bad smell. Or it might cause problems during soapmaking, giving off noxious fumes, or making the soap harden so fast that there's no time to pour it in the mold. Help has arrived. Anne L. Watson extends the low-temp techniques from her book \"Milk Soapmaking\" to making soap from a variety of special ingredients, including cucumber, citrus, pine tar, beer, and wine. Soaps that have long challenged home soapmakers will now pose no problem at all. ///////////////////////////////////////////////// Anne L. Watson is the first author to have introduced modern techniques of home soapmaking and lotionmaking to book readers.

History is rich with progressive victories over dirt, from the aqueducts and sewers of the Roman Empire to Sir Joseph Bazalgette's triumphant 'Main Drainage of London' in the mid-nineteenth century, which still functions today. Yet our relationship with dirt is complex and ambivalent. Dirt is waste, excrement, rubbish - but what then is soil? Is cleanliness next to godliness - or sterility? And in a throwaway society, does the battle against dirt depend on an exploited and half-seen underclass of cleaners? Published to coincide with a major new exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London in March 2011, and lavishly illustrated with images from the Wellcome's archives, this provocative book features specially commissioned essays and a short graphic novel section on the significance and implications of dirt from the microbial level through to the environmental.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "184668479X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781846684791"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O_tNSwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O_tNSwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=O_tNSwAACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=O_tNSwAACAAJ&dq=subject:Soap&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dirt.html?hl=&id=O_tNSwAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=O_tNSwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "vf__wAEACAAJ", "etag": "6zsCcQDzE2M", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/vf__wAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Girl's World Book of Bath and Beauty", "subtitle": "Fresh Ideas and Fun Recipes for Hair, Skin, Nails and More", "authors": ["Allison Chandler Smith"], "publisher": "Lark Books (NC)", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "Girls will love these goodies that soothe body and skin, and make them feel oh-so-pretty, like after a day at Mom\u2019s spa!
