Timothy"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2018-12-07", "description": "The Routledge Handbook on Tourism in the Middle East and North Africa examines the importance of tourism as a historical, economic, social, environmental, religious and political force in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). It highlights the ecological and resource challenges related to water, desert environments, climate change and oil. It provides an in-depth analysis of the geopolitical conditions that have long determined the patterns of tourism demand and supply throughout the region and how these play out in the everyday lives of residents and destinations as they attempt to grow tourism or ignore it entirely. While cultural heritage remains the primary tourism asset for the region as a whole, many new types of tourisms are emerging, especially in the Arabian Gulf region, where hyper-development is closely associated with the increasingly prominent role of luxury real estate and shopping, retail, medical tourism, cruises and transit tourism. The growing phenomenon of an expatriate workforce, and how its segregation from the citizenry creates a dual socio-economic system in several countries, is unmatched by other regions of the world. Many indigenous people of MENA keep themselves apart from other dominant groups in the region, although these social boundaries are becoming increasingly blurred as tourism, being one socio-economic force for change, has inspired many nomadic peoples to settle into towns and villages and rely more on tourists for their livelihoods. All of these issues and more shape the foundations of this book. This Handbook is the first of its kind to examine tourism from a broad regional and inclusive perspective, surveying a broad range of social, cultural, heritage, ecological and political matters in a single volume. With a wide range of contributors, many of whom are natives of the Middle East and North Africa, this Handbook is a vital resource for students and scholars interested in Tourism, Middle East Studies and Geography.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781317229230"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1317229231"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 392, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT367&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 21299, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 21299, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XRypDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 21299000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 21299000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Routledge_Handbook_on_Tourism_in_the_Mid-sample-epub.acsm?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Routledge_Handbook_on_Tourism_in_the_Mid-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XRypDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "order of 3\u20136 per cent annually (Airbus 2018; IATA 2016), and the <b>Middle East&#39;s</b> <br>\nheavy reliance on aviation, both in terms of inter-continental and intra-regional <br>\n<b>travel</b>, air <b>travel</b> is therefore central to the arguments presented in this chapter."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HlltDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "dy0AkyFtAH0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HlltDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Lonely Planet Middle East", "authors": ["Lonely Planet", "Anthony Ham", "Paul Clammer", "Mark Elliott", "Jessica Lee", "Virginia Maxwell", "Simon Richmond", "Daniel Robinson", "Anthony Sattin", "Dan Savery Raz"], "publisher": "Lonely Planet", "publishedDate": "2018-09-01", "description": "Lonely Planet: The world\u2019s number one travel guide publisher* Lonely Planet\u2019s Middle East is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

She focuses on the evolution of Orientalism and the reconstruction - through contact with other cultures - of gender and class. Beginning with the eighteenth century Billie Melman describes the many ways in which women looked at oriental people and places and developed a discourse which presented a challenge to hegemonic notions on the exotic and 'different'. Through her examination of the writings of famous feminist writers, travellers, ethnographers, missionaries, archaeologists and Biblical scholars, many of which are studied here for the first time, Billie Melman challenges traditional interpretations of Orientalism, placing gender at the forefront of colonial studies. 'This book provides a real extension to Edward Said's writing not only in the sense of challenging Edward Said's perspective, but also by adding a significant empirical and conceptual element to the discussion on orientalism. Those interested in women's history, in the cultural politics of cross-cultural encounters and in feminist or cultural theory will find much to engage them, inform them and challenge them in Melman's book.' - Joanna De Groot, Times Higher Education Supplement 'Using the perspectives of both gender and class Melman sets an alternative view of the Orient against that of Said... a much less monolithic and much more complex and heterogenous than that of Said' - Francis Robinson, Times Literary Supplement 'Women's Orients is an important contribution to our understanding of Orientalism. Melman's work is characterized by a fruitful bringing together of the skills of the historian with the sensitive reading of the British women writers...' - Catherine Hall, The Feminist Review 'An excellent work...

After marrying the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt in 1869, the pair travelled extensively in the Middle East, developing an especial fondness for the region and its people. In this book, Lisa Lacy explores the life, travels and political ideas of Lady Anne. With a broad knowledge of the Arab world, she challenged prevailing assumptions and, as a result of her aristocratic heritage, exerted strong influence in British political circles. Her extensive journeys in the Mediterranean region, North Africa, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Iraq and Persia formed the basis of her knowledge about the Middle East. She pursued an intimate knowledge of Bedouin life in Arabia, the town culture of Syria and Mesopotamia and the politics of nationalism in Egypt. Her husband, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, gained a reputation as an anti-imperialist political activist.

He doesn\u2019t have a funny beard and he\u2019s never even driven a buggy, but his family hails from the same Mennonite community that Miriam Toews fictionalized in A Complicated Kindness. From childhood through college, Kroeker attended Christian schools where he learned to think critically back to predetermined conclusions. Years later, when his faith begins to unravel, Kroeker stops short of tossing it all aside, choosing instead to leave every unanswered question hanging there on the edge of his mind. He might have gotten away with it, too, except for a drunken resolution that forces the issue of God back into his life. In the fall of 2007, Kroeker decides to ride his motorcycle across Europe and into the theocratic nation of Iran... a nation ruled by God. In the end, Kroeker finds himself on a forbidden visit to the holiest Muslim shrine in all of Iran. Once inside, invisible hands reach into Kroeker\u2019s chest and rip from his heart a sincere prayer, his first in many years. And God hears that prayer. For before Kroeker can escape Mashhad, God steals into his hotel room one night to threaten him with death. At least, that\u2019s one way to look at it. Throughout the narrative, Kroeker swings from dogmatic belief in God to overwhelming doubt before finally deciding that the key to approaching God is humility. He understands that uncertainty is not only an acceptable state of mind when considering the Divine, but it is necessary. He will always fear God. But who knows? Perhaps if he keeps riding, one of these days God will speak clearly.

Michael Hall", "Alan A. Lew"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2009-09-10", "description": "As one of the world\u2019s largest industries, tourism carries with it significant social, environmental, economic and political impacts. Although tourism can provide significant economic benefits for some destinations, the image of tourism as a benign and environmentally friendly industry has often been challenged. There is a clear and growing body of evidence that suggests that the effects of tourism development are far more complex than policy-makers usually suggest and that the impacts of tourism occur not just at the destination but at all stages of a tourist\u2019s trip. Furthermore, tourism does not exist in a vacuum. Broader social and environmental changes also shape the form, growth and experience of tourism development. This text provides a clear, accessible and up-to-date synthesis of tourism\u2019s role in our contemporary world, both as an agent of change, and as a response to it. Tourism-related change is approached from a framework that illustrates the changing environments in which they occur, including the spatial scale of such impacts and the effects of these impacts over time. This framework is then applied to the economic, socio-cultural and physical dimensions of tourism. After examining the different forms of tourism-related impacts, the book then discusses the role of planning as part of an integrated approach to the mitigation of undesirable impacts and the maximization of the desirable benefits of tourism development. Case studies and illustrations from a variety of locations from around the world are used throughout the book to exemplify key themes and issues; additionally figures and tables serve to elucidate statistical data. Understanding and Managing Tourism Impacts illustrates that when well managed tourism can make a positive contribution to destinations. The books use of issues of scale, time and form to illustrate the effects of tourism provide an accessible and significant reminder that tourism\u2019s impacts vary over time and space, affects both the visitor and the host community, and can be unpredictable in its consequences. Chapter objectives, recommended readings, and links to web-based material help students, practitioners and researchers to grasp the broader implications of tourism development in today's world. With tourism increasingly being implicated as a factor in climate and environmental change, and with the benefits and costs of tourism as a form of economic development being examined more closely than ever, this book provides a timely contribution to help clarify the potentials and pitfalls of contemporary tourism.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135983864"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1135983860"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 392, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.3.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=decpXv3720AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=decpXv3720AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=decpXv3720AC&pg=PA102&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=decpXv3720AC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=decpXv3720AC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4931.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4931.22, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=decpXv3720AC&rdid=book-decpXv3720AC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4931220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4931220000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Understanding_and_Managing_Tourism_Impac-sample-epub.acsm?id=decpXv3720AC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Understanding_and_Managing_Tourism_Impac-sample-pdf.acsm?id=decpXv3720AC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=decpXv3720AC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In addition there is the tendency for many Americans not to <b>travel</b> to other <br>\ncountries, with only about 27 per cent of US citizens holding a passport in 2006 (<br>\nLeffel 2006).

It stands to reason that the nation that prided itself on its engineering prowess and had more to gain than any other in the construction of a direct route to India would have played a role in its making. Yet the British shied away from any participation in the international project\u2014only to swoop down on the finished project and claim it as their own when they purchased it in 1875, an event which led directly to Egypt\u2019s colonization in 1882. Murray uncovers the little-known story of Britain\u2019s swing from ambivalence about to acceptance of what would become a potent symbol of Western imperialism. Beginning with the railway mania of the 1840s and concluding with the opening of the new global routes of the 1870s, Murray argues that changes in notions about character, investment, and technology propagated in the novel form over this period enabled Britain to lay claim to the globe. Arguing that literary genre was itself a technology that spread imperialism, Murray shows how roads, canals, and novels together colonized the Middle East.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781135905897"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1135905894"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 212, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Criticism"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pVOTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pVOTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pVOTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA87&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pVOTAgAAQBAJ&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Victorian_Narrative_Technologies_in_the.html?hl=&id=pVOTAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pVOTAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Romance was especially popular among <b>travel</b> writers.

After marrying the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt in 1869, the pair travelled extensively in the Middle East, developing an especial fondness for the region and its people. In this book, Lisa Lacy explores the life, travels and political ideas of Lady Anne. With a broad knowledge of the Arab world, she challenged prevailing assumptions and, as a result of her aristocratic heritage, exerted strong influence in British political circles. Her extensive journeys in the Mediterranean region, North Africa, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Iraq and Persia formed the basis of her knowledge about the Middle East. She pursued an intimate knowledge of Bedouin life in Arabia, the town culture of Syria and Mesopotamia and the politics of nationalism in Egypt. Her husband, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, gained a reputation as an anti-imperialist political activist. Lacy shows that Lady Anne was her husband's partner in marriage, politics and travel and exerted strong influence not only on his ideas, but on the ideas of the British political elite of the era.",

as those by Paul Theroux, Bill Bryson, Bruce Chatwin and Michael Palin, tell us as much about world politics as newspaper articles, policy documents and press releases? Debbie Lisle argues that the formulations of genre, identity, geopolitics and history at work in contemporary travel writing are increasingly at odds with a cosmopolitan and multicultural world in which 'everybody travels'. Despite the forces of globalization, common stereotypes about 'foreignness' continue to shape the experience of modern travel. The Global Politics of Contemporary Travel Writing, first published in 2006, is concerned with the way contemporary travelogues engage with, and try to resolve, familiar struggles about global politics such as the protection of human rights, the promotion of democracy, the management of equality within multiculturalism and the reduction of inequality.

The transformations along these three dimensions density, distance, and division are most noticeable in North America, Western Europe, and Japan, but countries in Asia and Eastern Europe are changing in ways similar in scope and speed. 'World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography' concludes that these spatial transformations are essential, and should be encouraged. The conclusion is not without controversy. Slum-dwellers now number a billion, but the rush to cities continues. Globalization is believed to benefit many, but not the billion people living in lagging areas of developing nations. High poverty and mortality persist among the world's 'bottom billion', while others grow wealthier and live longer lives. Concern for these three billion often comes with the prescription that growth must be made spatially balanced. The WDR has a different message: economic growth is seldom balanced, and efforts to spread it out prematurely will jeopardize progress. The Report: documents how production becomes more concentrated spatially as economies grow. proposes economic integration as the principle for promoting successful spatial transformations. revisits the debates on urbanization, territorial development, and regional integration and shows how today's developers can reshape economic geography.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "082137608X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780821376089"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 300, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC&pg=PA177&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=34&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1760.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1760.79, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC&rdid=book-ZkDE5CxAqHcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1760790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1760790000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "ALL_PAGES", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "An estimated 320 million people meet annually at professional and corporate <br>\nevents after <b>traveling</b> by air. ... sent to stores elsewhere in the world: \u201cPlanes from <br>\nZaragoza, Spain, land in Bahrain with goods for Inditex stores in the <b>Middle East</b>,<br>\n&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "8zY7Pe4jv9AC", "etag": "mIitE1UsTbE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8zY7Pe4jv9AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Aviation and Tourism", "subtitle": "Implications for Leisure Travel", "authors": ["Dr Andreas Papatheodorou", "Professor Peter Forsyth", "Dr Anne Graham"], "publisher": "Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.", "publishedDate": "2012-10-01", "description": "This book deals exclusively with issues related to the relationship between aviation and leisure travel.

Faraway and evermore \u2018exotic\u2019 holidays are becoming widespread and within reach as destinations make their entry into the mass tourism market. Strolls through the bazaars of Istanbul and cruises on the Nile are packaged into the sea, sand and sun culture of traditional forms of organized mass tourism. At the same time new technologies weave the fabric of tourism and everyday life even closer, circulating images, information, and objects between them. Taking off from this observation, Tourism, Performance and the Everyday invites readers to follow the flow\u2019s of tourist desires, objects, meanings, photographs, fears, dreams and memories weaving together the spaces of and between Western Europe, Turkey and Egypt. Tourism, Performance and the Everyday carefully analyzes the cultural and social impacts of mass-tourist experiences of \u2018exotic\u2019 places on the wider aspects of everyday life. It treats mass-tourism as a cultural phenomenon that feeds into the practices and networks of peoples\u2019 everyday lives rather than as an isolated, trivial or \u2018exotic\u2019 event. It traces how these impacts are mediated by various mobilities between home and away through innovate mobile and ethnographic research methods at tourist destinations and the home of tourists. The book contains analysis of diaries, photographs, blogs and photo web sharing sites, participant observation of performing tourists and \u2018home ethnographies\u2019 of the afterlife tourist photographs, souvenirs and memories. In doing this, the book traces out the multiple interconnections and mobilities between everyday spaces and leisure spaces as well as the multiple ways in which the Orient is consumed on holiday and at home.

The 1991 Madrid Peace Conference sought to change this pattern, launching bilateral and multilateral tracks in the Arab-Israeli peace process. As a result, a broad group of Arab states sat down with Israel and began to cooperate on a wide range of regional issues in what became known as the Middle East multilaterals. Yet why did enemies reluctant even to recognize one another choose to cooperate on regional problems? And once this process began, what drove the parties to continue such cooperation or, in some cases, halt their cooperative efforts? Beyond the Handshake addresses these fundamental questions, exploring the origins of the multilaterals and the development of multilateral cooperation in the areas of arms control and regional security, economic development, water management, and the environment. Dalia Dassa Kaye, challenging conventional concepts of cooperation, argues that multilateral cooperation in the Middle East must be appreciated as a process of interaction rather than solely as a set of outcomes. Presenting theoretical insights of value to students of regional and international relations, Beyond the Handshake provides a unique look at the evolving nature of Arab-Israeli relations and exposes the foundation the multilateral peace process laid for future regional cooperation in the Middle East.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231505321"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231505329"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.5.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA282&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=53&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Beyond_the_Handshake.html?hl=&id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Beyond_the_Handshake-sample-epub.acsm?id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Beyond_the_Handshake-sample-pdf.acsm?id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xdI2AAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "See U.S. State Department Fact Sheet, \u201c<b>Middle East</b>-Mediterranean <b>Travel</b> and <br>\n<b>Tourism</b>.\u201d Casablanca Declaration, October 30\u2013November 1, 1994.

This comparative approach allows us to see that writers in all three religious communities used travel writing in the same way, to shape the perceptions of their readers by asserting the author's authority. The central paradox of religious travel writing is that the travel writer reads about a place, usually in a sacred text, decide to supplement the reading with the empirical experience of visiting and describing the place, and the creates his own descriptive text. But in writing this new book, and in letting his readers know his authorial authority, the travel writer himself is daring the reader to challenge the new text. Is a book ever enough?

In texts that vary from travel accounts to sailors' memoirs, complete travelogues, autobiographies, and letters, it looks at British representations of Oman as a place, people, and culture. The study discusses the current Orientalist debate suggesting alternatives to the dilemma of Orientalism. It also outlines the historical Omani-British relations, and examines the travel accounts written by several British merchants and sailors who stopped in Muscat and other Omani coastal cities in the nineteenth century. Another focus is with the works of travellers who penetrated the Interior of Oman such as James Wellsted and Samuel Miles, and the travellers who explored the southern Oman and the Empty Quarter. Finally the book looks at the last generation of British travellers who were in Oman from 1950 to 1970 employed either by oil companies or the Sultan Said bin Taimur.

On these journeys, voyagers not only interacted with foreign cultures\u2014touring Greek civilization, exploring the Middle East and North Africa, and seeing parts of Europe\u2014they also established both philosophical and geographic boundaries between the faithful and the heathen. These voyages thus gave the Islamic world, which at the time extended from the Maghreb to the Indus Valley, a coherent identity. Islam and Travel in the Middle Ages assesses both the religious and philosophical aspects of travel, as well as the economic and cultural conditions that made the rihla possible. Houari Touati tracks the compilers of the hadith who culled oral traditions linked to the prophet, the linguists and lexicologists who journeyed to the desert to learn Bedouin Arabic, the geographers who mapped the Muslim world, and the students who ventured to study with holy men and scholars. Travel, with its costs, discomforts, and dangers, emerges in this study as both a means of spiritual growth and a metaphor for progress.

Peter Swaab sets them alongside a generous selection from Lear's six travel books (including his three Journals of a Landscape Painter), first published between 1841 and 1870, and long out of print.

Catherine Hezser shows that certain segments of ancient Jewish society were quite mobile. Mobility seems to have increased in the later Roman period, when an extensive road system facilitated travel within the province of Syria-Palestine and the neighbouring Middle Eastern regions. Second Temple Judaism was centralized, with Jerusalem as its central space and seat of priestly authority. In post-70 rabbinic Judaism, on the other hand, connections between rabbis could be established through mutual visits and second- and third-degree contacts only. Mobility formed the basis of the establishment of a decentralized rabbinic network in Palestine and Babylonia in late antiquity. Numerous narrative and halakhic traditions indicate the importance of mobility for communication and the exchange of knowledge amongst rabbis. It is argued that the rabbis who were most mobile sat at the nodal points of the rabbinic network and elicited the largest amount of influence. They would have combined business travel with scholarly exchange. Scholars' journeys between Palestine and Babylonia are viewed within the wider context of Rome and Persia's economic and cultural exchange in which Jews, just like Christians, may have played the role of intermediaries.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3161508890"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783161508899"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 529, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c8uZBpWuooQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c8uZBpWuooQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=c8uZBpWuooQC&pg=PA441&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=85&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=c8uZBpWuooQC&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Jewish_Travel_in_Antiquity.html?hl=&id=c8uZBpWuooQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=c8uZBpWuooQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Rabbinic narratives present rabbis as <b>travelling</b> within the Land of Israel and \u2014 <br>\nless often \u2014 to Diaspora locations ... for the entire Roman-Byzantine period <br>\nrabbinic references to <b>travel</b> focus on Roman Palestine and the Near and <b>Middle</b> <br>\n<b>East</b>,&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9rWSAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "JbFmb2ivR3E", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9rWSAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Travel Writing, Form, and Empire", "subtitle": "The Poetics and Politics of Mobility", "authors": ["Julia Kuehn", "Paul Smethurst"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2008-11-19", "description": "This collection of essays is an important contribution to travel writing studies -- looking beyond the explicitly political questions of postcolonial and gender discourses, it considers the form, poetics, institutions and reception of travel writing in the history of empire and its aftermath. Starting from the premise that travel writing studies has received much of its impetus and theoretical input from the sometimes overgeneralized precepts of postcolonial studies and gender studies, this collection aims to explore more widely and more locally the expression of imperialist discourse in travel writing, and also to locate within contemporary travel writing attempts to evade or re-engage with the power politics of such discourse.

A multimodal analysis is used to consider a variety of texts including novels, brochures, blogs, websites, radio commercials, videos, postcards and authentic tourist pictures and their meaning-making dynamics within the tourism discourse. The book looks at the ways in which these different texts have influenced how tourists and travellers have been viewed over time and how we envision ourselves as tourists or travellers. It puts forward multimodal analysis as the best framework for exploring the semiotic potential of these texts. Including examples from the UK, Malta, Canada, New Zealand, India, Jamaica and South Africa, this volume will be useful for researchers and students in tourism studies, communication and media studies and applied linguistics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781845414290"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1845414292"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 200, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.5.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT17&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2490.28, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2490.28, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gBHsAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2490280000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2490280000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Reading_Tourism_Texts-sample-epub.acsm?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Reading_Tourism_Texts-sample-pdf.acsm?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gBHsAgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "other holidaymakers as &#39;tourists&#39; and <b>travel</b> texts define similar texts as &#39;tourist&#39; <br>\npublications. ...

In Greece, I enjoyed our trek up the Acropolis and the view of Athens on that clear and sunny day was beautiful. The Parthenon was graceful even as the workmen were repairing cracks and weathered places in preparation for the upcoming summer Olympics. It was stimulating to be on a cruise with Karen Armstrong in Greece. She gave lectures about the monotheistic religions as we visited a number of sacred sites.

The changes in law and the culture had been made only a few years before the Parliament of the World\u2019s Religions held its convocation there. Former President Nelson Mandela addressed us. Perhaps the greatest treat for me was the visit to the Soviet Union in 1989 just two months before the Berlin wall came down and the world rejoiced in the televised performance of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony conducted by Leonard Bernstein.

Often, the difference between a successful organisation and one that fails is that organisation's level of cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence has never been more important as businesses globalise, especially in parts of the world that are very different to markets in the West.

The War Against the Terror Masters examines the two sides of the war: the rise of the international terror network, and the past and current efforts of our intelligence services to destroy the terror masters in the U.S. and overseas. Ledeen's new book also visits every country in the Near East and describes the terrorist cancers in each. Among many revelations that will attract wide attention: *How the terror network survived the loss of its main sponsor, the Soviet Union. *How the FBI learned from a KGB defector--twenty years before Osama's bin Laden's murderous assault--of the existance of Arab terrorist sleeper networks inside the United States. *How moralistic guidelines straight-jacketed the FBI from even collecting a file of newspaper clippings on known terror groups operating in America. *How the internal culture of the CIA, and severe limitations on its ability to operate, blinded us to the growth of terror networks.

This book provides a detailed examination of their rights as minorities within this region, and their changing status throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The rights of minorities in the Middle East are subject to a range of legal frameworks, having developed in part from Islamic law, and in recent years subject to international human rights law and institutional frameworks. The book examines the context in which minority rights operate within this conflicted region, investigating how minorities engage with (or are excluded from) various sites of power and how state practice in dealing with minorities (often ostensibly based on Islamic authority) intersects with and informs modern constitutionalism and international law. The book identifies who exactly can be classed as a minority group, analysing in detail the different religious and ethnic minorities across the region. The book also pays special attention to the plight of minorities who are spread between various states, often as the result of conflict. It assesses the applicable domestic legislative instruments within the three countries investigated as case studies: Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, and highlights key domestic remedies that could serve as models for ensuring greater social cohesion and greater inclusion of minorities in the political life of these countries.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780191668883"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0191668885"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 456, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "3.5.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&pg=PT118&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9VHRny2tWgcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2942.63, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2942.63, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&rdid=book-9VHRny2tWgcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2942630000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2942630000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Minority_Rights_in_the_Middle_East-sample-epub.acsm?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Minority_Rights_in_the_Middle_East-sample-pdf.acsm?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9VHRny2tWgcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "There remain restrictions on <b>travel</b> as &#39;the Government suspended its policy of <br>\nallowing Yemeniorigin Israeli passport holders to <b>travel</b> to Yemen on <br>\nlaissezpasser documents&#39;,51 though no such restrictions exist for Yemeni, Israeli, <br>\nand other&nbsp;..."}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "nsMUikB80wYC", "etag": "7V7t33DkG6s", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nsMUikB80wYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Sex, Tourism and the Postcolonial Encounter", "subtitle": "Landscapes of Longing in Egypt", "authors": ["Jessica Jacobs"], "publisher": "Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.", "publishedDate": "2012-11-28", "description": "Illustrated by revealing interviews with women and men in the tourist resorts in the Sinai, Egypt, this book is ostensibly about western women who sleep with 'native' men while on holiday. Broadening the scope of issues involved, it examines the link between these holiday romances and a much wider romanticism of place and people \u2013 of the landscapes of paradise, deserts and the lure of the Bedouin sheikh \u2013 that are used to sell these destinations. It argues that the romantic stereotyping and deliberate positioning of 'Third World' resorts as places that somehow exist outside of the modernities the women come from is inextricably bound up in the relationships. Similarly, for the local man the tourist resort is perceived as a place other than his own cultural space and time and represents a modernity that is otherwise only found in the 'West'. The relationships that ensue can therefore only occur because the tourist resort acts as an intermediate space. In analyzing the interaction of these men and women within the context of modernity, the book provides insights into gender issues to do with globalization, travel and sexuality, as well as opening up the debate on sex tourism and showing this to be a lot more ambiguous and complicated than it might at first appear.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781409488798"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1409488799"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 154, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nsMUikB80wYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nsMUikB80wYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nsMUikB80wYC&pg=PA21&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nsMUikB80wYC&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sex_Tourism_and_the_Postcolonial_Encount.html?hl=&id=nsMUikB80wYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sex_Tourism_and_the_Postcolonial_Encount-sample-epub.acsm?id=nsMUikB80wYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sex_Tourism_and_the_Postcolonial_Encount-sample-pdf.acsm?id=nsMUikB80wYC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nsMUikB80wYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "As we have seen in the previous chapter, the ethnic encounter is a crucial <br>\ncomponent of contemporary <b>tourism</b> to the <b>Middle East</b>, particularly among <br>\nadventure <b>travel</b> tour companies and backpacker <b>tourism</b>.

The first comprehensive investigation of Jewish travel writing from this era, this study engages with questions raised by postcolonial studies and contributes to the debate over the nature and history of Orientalism as defined by Edward Said. Examining two dozen Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic travel accounts from the mid-twelfth to the early sixteenth centuries, Martin Jacobs asks whether Jewish travelers shared Western perceptions of the Islamic world with their Christian counterparts. Most Jews who detailed their journeys during this period hailed from Christian lands and many sailed to the Eastern Mediterranean aboard Christian-owned vessels. Yet Jacobs finds that their descriptions of the Near East subvert or reorient a decidedly Christian vision of the region. The accounts from the crusader era, in particular, are often critical of the Christian church and present glowing portraits of Muslim-Jewish relations. By contrast, some of the later travelers discussed in the book express condescending attitudes toward Islam, Muslims, and Near Eastern Jews. Placing shifting perspectives on the Muslim world in their historical, social, and literary contexts, Jacobs interprets these texts as mirrors of changing Jewish self-perceptions.

However, despite the fact that cross-border travel implies certain citizenship rights as well as the material capacity to travel, the manifold intersections between tourism and citizenship have not received the attention they deserve in the literature. This book endeavours to fill this gap by being the first to fully examine the role of tourism in wider society through a critically-informed sociological reflection on the unfolding relationships between international tourism and distinct renderings of citizenship, with particular emphasis on the ideological and political alignments between the freedom of movement and the right to travel. The text weaves its analysis of citizenship and travel in the context of addressing large-scale societal transformations engendered by globalization, neoliberalism and the geopolitical realignments between states, as well as comprehending the internal reconfiguring of the relationship between citizens and states themselves. By doing so, it focuses on key themes including: tourism and social citizenship rights; race, culture and minority rights; states, markets and the freedom of movement; tourism, peace and geo-politics; consumerism and class; and, ethical tourism, global citizenship and cosmopolitanism. The book concludes that the advancement of genuinely democratic and just forms of tourism must be commensurate with demands for distributive justice and a democratic politics of mobility encompassing all of humanity. This timely and significant contribution to the sociology and politics of international tourism through the lens of citizenship is a must read for students and scholars in both in the fields of tourism and social science.

These trafficked sex slaves form the backbone of one of the world's most profitable illicit enterprises and generate huge profits for their exploiters, for unlike narcotics, which must be grown, harvested, refined, and packaged, sex slaves require no such \"processing,\" and can be repeatedly \"consumed.\" Kara first encountered the horrors of slavery in a Bosnian refugee camp in 1995. Subsequently, in the first journey of its kind, he traveled across four continents to investigate these crimes and take stock of their devastating human toll. Kara made several trips to India, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Albania, Moldova, Mexico, and the United States. He witnessed firsthand the sale of human beings into slavery, interviewed over four hundred slaves, and confronted some of those who trafficked and exploited them. In this book, Kara provides a riveting account of his journey into this unconscionable industry, sharing the moving stories of its victims and revealing the shocking conditions of their exploitation. He draws on his background in finance, economics, and law to provide the first ever business analysis of contemporary slavery worldwide, focusing on its most profitable and barbaric form: sex trafficking. Kara describes the local factors and global economic forces that gave rise to this and other forms of modern slavery over the past two decades and quantifies, for the first time, the size, growth, and profitability of each industry. Finally, he identifies the sectors of the sex trafficking industry that would be hardest hit by specifically designed interventions and recommends the specific legal, tactical, and policy measures that would target these vulnerable sectors and help to abolish this form of slavery, once and for all. The author will donate a portion of the proceeds of this book to the anti-slavery organization, Free the Slaves.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231511391"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231511396"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "2.9.9.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&pg=PA109&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=107&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sex_Trafficking.html?hl=&id=SH1sBUTysPMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sex_Trafficking-sample-epub.acsm?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Sex_Trafficking-sample-pdf.acsm?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SH1sBUTysPMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "... increase in advertisements for <b>travel</b> to the <b>Middle East</b> and North Africa, <br>\nspecifically the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia.

She soon found herself back in the Middle East travelling through a region in revolt. In A Time of Monsters bears witness to the demands of young people for dignity and justice during the Arab Spring; the inability of sclerotic regimes to reform; the descent of Syria into civil war; the rise of the Islamic State; and the flight of refugees to Europe. With deep empathy for its people and an extensive understanding of the Middle East, Sky makes a complex region more comprehensible. A great storyteller and observational writer, Sky also reveals the ties that bind the Middle East to the West and how blowback from our interventions in the region contributed to the British vote to leave the European Union and to the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1786495627"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781786495624"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Middle East"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=obw0xQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=obw0xQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=obw0xQEACAAJ&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=obw0xQEACAAJ&dq=Middle+East+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/In_a_Time_of_Monsters.html?hl=&id=obw0xQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=obw0xQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A blistering account from the acclaimed author of The Unravelling, which traces the threads of violence that have scorched the Middle East for decades"}}]
