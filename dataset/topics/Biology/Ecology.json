Occupying a crucial place between land and sea, these tidal ecosystems provide a valuable ecological and economic resource as important nursery grounds and breeding sites for many organisms, and as a renewable source of wood and traditional foods and medicines. Perhaps most importantly, they are accumulation sites for sediment, contaminants, carbon and nutrients, and offer significant protection against coastal erosion. This book presents a functional overview of mangrove forest ecosystems; how they live and grow at the edge of tropical seas, how they play a critical role along most of the world\u2019s tropical coasts, and how their future might look in a world affected by climate change. Such a process-oriented approach is necessary in order to further understand the role of these dynamic forests in ecosystem function, and as a first step towards developing adequate strategies for their conservation and sustainable use and management. The book will provide a valuable resource for researchers in mangrove ecology as well as reference for resource managers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402042713"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "140204271X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tHM54IKQSv4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&rdid=book-tHM54IKQSv4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Energetics_of_Mangrove_Forests-sample-epub.acsm?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Energetics_of_Mangrove_Forests-sample-pdf.acsm?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "qtJp7aAZV_oC", "etag": "seyV37qJSSo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qtJp7aAZV_oC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "This Sacred Earth", "subtitle": "Religion, Nature, Environment", "authors": ["Roger S.

As such, we have made no attempt to address those aspects of theoretical ecology that are concerned with how animals might choose their resources if they acted in an optimal manner. The book is based on the concept of a resource selection function (RSF), where this is a function of characteristics measured on resourceunits such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used. We argue that this concept leads to a unified theory for the analysis and interpretation of data on resource selection and can replace many ad hoc statistical methods that have been used in the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306481512"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306481510"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rBXnBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Resource_Selection_by_Animals-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QUpIAAAAQBAJ", "etag": "GmCQ2GcsAbI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QUpIAAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Science for Agriculture and Rural Development in Low-income Countries", "authors": ["Reimund Roetter", "Herman van Keulen", "Marijke Kuiper", "J.

Some new material has been added, particularly where it has been possible to update data, and there has been some change of emphasis in places, in order to reflect changing world conditions. The book retains its original purpose, however, of introducing systems thinking as applied to agriculture. I am grateful to Angela Hoxey for help in preparing this edition, especially in relation to the preparation of tables and figures. C. R. W. SPEDDING v Preface to the First Edition The agricultural systems of the world represent a very large subject. Their study involves a great deal of fairly detailed knowledge, as well as a grasp of the structures and functions of the systems themselves. This book has been written as an introduction to such a study and it concentrates on an overall view, rather than on the detail, partly because of the need to relate the latter to some larger picture in order to appreciate the relevance and significance of the detail. This problem-of seeing the relevance of component studies and the significance of physical, biological and economic detail, and indeed principles-is encountered by many agricultural students right at the beginning of their university careers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401164085"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401164088"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 190, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-sEHwCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/An_Introduction_to_Agricultural_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sEHwCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "E7R2q19X3toC", "etag": "K/iJTGexQeY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/E7R2q19X3toC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Population Systems", "subtitle": "A General Introduction", "authors": ["Alan A.

For obvious reasons it has remained a source of fascination and inspiration for people from all walks of life. Almost all the natural resources of the Himalaya have presented a challenge for environmental scientists and planners alike. It is principally because of their numbers, an extensive array of natural characteristics and the complexity of the cultural pattern of the mountains that the Himalayan environment has lured the intelligensia of the world. However, hostile natural environment together with illconceived human activities have added fury to the fire. It is not an exaggeration, therefore, that the environment of our fragile mountain ecosystem in utter disrepair and indeed in very poor state of health. The renewed enthusiasm for man and biosphere and sustainable development had stemmed in no small measure from the tremendous interest in ecology juxtaposed to man s growing awareness of the degraded Himalaya. As the issues and challenges involved in describing mutual conditioning of the environmental cycles and human association in the Himalaya, quantitative and qualitative surveys for whole stretch of the Central Himalaya in question have not been attempted thus far. We have all good reasons to believe that environmental consciousness is extremely necessary in order to restore the balance in ecological components of the Himalaya.

The Biodiversity section emphasises the vast range of life forms in tropical forests and considers the theory and practice of estimating species richness and spatial distribution, while contributions on Forest Dynamics provide a better understanding of the maintenance of this species richness. With an improved background of ideas on rainforest dynamics and biodiversity, better management and conservation strategies are possible, and some of these are explored in the papers on Socioeconomics.

Despite the tremendous role of prokaryotic diversity in the function of the global ecosystem, it remains understudied in comparison to the rest of biological diversity. In this book, the authors argue that understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence, functioning relationships (e.g. nutrient cycling and host fitness), and trophic and non-trophic interactions are helpful in addressing the future challenges in basic and applied research in microbial ecology. The authors also examine the ecological and evolutionary responses of prokaryotes to global change and biodiversity loss. Ecological Diversity of the Microbiome in the Context of Ecology Theory and Climate Change aims to bring prokaryotes into the focus of ecological and evolutionary research, especially in the context of global change.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319116655"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319116657"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 152, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.4.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-8vVNBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Microbiome_Community_Ecology-sample-epub.acsm?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Microbiome_Community_Ecology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8vVNBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tMyiqBwTG3YC", "etag": "9CntNzO9Gm8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tMyiqBwTG3YC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Animals in Traditional Folk Medicine", "subtitle": "Implications for Conservation", "authors": ["R\u00f4mulo Romeu N\u00f3brega Alves", "Ierec\u00ea Lucena Rosa"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-09-19", "description": "People have relied on medicinal products derived from natural sources for millennia, and animals have long been an important part of that repertoire; nearly all cultures, from ancient times to the present, have used animals as a source of medicine. Ingredients derived from wild animals are not only widely used in traditional remedies, but are also increasingly valued as raw materials in the preparation of modern medicines. Regrettably, the unsustainable use of plants and animals in traditional medicine is recognized as a threat to wildlife conservation, as a result of which discussions concerning the links between traditional medicine and biodiversity are becoming increasingly imperative, particularly in view of the fact that folk medicine is the primary source of health care for 80% of the world\u2019s population.

Somers", "Matthew Hayward"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23", "description": "The conflict between increasing human population and biodiversity conservation is one of the IUCN\u2019s key threatening processes. Conservation planning has received a great deal of coverage and research as a way of conserving biodiversity yet, while theoretically successful, it has never been tested. Simple lines on maps to illustrate conservation areas are unlikely to be successful in the light of human encroachment. It may be that some form of overt display is necessary to ensure the protection of reserves. This may be signage, presence of guards/rangers or physical fencing structures. The need for some form of barrier goes beyond restricting human access. The megafauna of Africa pose a genuine threat to human survival. In southern Africa, fences keep animals in and protect the abutting human population. Elsewhere, fencing is not considered important or viable. Where poverty is rife, it won\u2019t take much to tip the balance from beneficial conservation areas to troublesome repositories of crop-raiders, diseases and killers. Conversely, in New Zealand fences are used to keep animals out. Introduced species have decimated New Zealand\u2019s endemic birds, reptiles and invertebrates, and several sites have been entirely encapsulated in mouse-proof fencing to ensure their protection.

Ecology, the science that underpins the technol ogy of conservation, is still too immature to provide all the wisdom that it must. It is arguable that the desire to conserve nature will in itself force the discipline of ecology to identify fundamental prob lems in its scientific goals and methods. In return, ecologists may be able to offer some insights that make conservation more practicable (Harper 1987). The idea that nature (species or communities) is worth preserv ing rests on several fundamental arguments, particularly the argu ment of nostalgia and the argument of human benefit and need. Nostalgia, of course, is a powerful emotion. With some notable ex ceptions, there is usually a feeling of dismay at a change in the sta tus quo, whether it be the loss of a place in the country for walking or rambling, the loss of a painting or architectural monument, or that one will never again have the chance to see a particular species of bird or plant.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468464269"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468464264"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 507, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yRLrBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Conservation_Biology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yRLrBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tLLoCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "T29bCP64foc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tLLoCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Alpine Plant Life", "subtitle": "Functional Plant Ecology of High Mountain Ecosystems", "authors": ["Christian K\u00f6rner"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "Generations of plant scientists have been fascinated by alpine plant lifean ecosystem that experiences dramatic climatic gradients over a very short distance.

Early studies of bryophyte communities have led to detailed investigations into the relationships between the plants and their environment. Ecological papers, the large number of which is evidenced by the length of the bibliographies in the subsequent chapters, have appeared in numerous journals. Yet, apart from review chapters, by H. Gams and P. W. Richards in Manual of Bryology, edited b:; H. Verdoorn in 1932 and chapters in E. V. Watson's Structure and Life of Bryophytes, Prem Puri's Bryophytes - A Broad Perspective and D. H. S. Richardson's The Biology of Mosses, published in 1972,1973 and 1981 respectively, no general accounts of bryophyte ecology have been published. Although the Bryophyta is a relatively small division of plants, with between 14000 and 21000 species the interest that they have aroused is out of all proportion to the size either of the plants or of the division. It is evident, however, that despite their relative insigni ficance they play an important ecological role, especially in extreme environments and, in the case of bryophytes in tropical cloud forests and of Sphagnum, may even be a dominant factor in the ecology of the area concerned.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400958913"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400958919"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 512, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zxHtCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bryophyte_Ecology-sample-epub.acsm?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bryophyte_Ecology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zxHtCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rNp5BgAAQBAJ", "etag": "8LYRIOUxulQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rNp5BgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Code Biology", "subtitle": "A New Science of Life", "authors": ["Marcello Barbieri"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2015-02-02", "description": "This book is the study of all codes of life with the standard methods of science. The genetic code and the codes of culture have been known for a long time and represent the historical foundation of this book. What is really new in this field is the study of all codes that came after the genetic code and before the codes of culture. The existence of these organic codes, however, is not only a major experimental fact. It is one of those facts that have extraordinary theoretical implications. The first is that most events of macroevolution were associated with the origin of new organic codes, and this gives us a completely new reconstruction of the history of life. The second implication is that codes involve meaning and we need therefore to introduce in biology not only the concept of information but also the concept of biological meaning. The third theoretical implication comes from the fact that the organic codes have been highly conserved in evolution, which means that they are the greatest invariants of life. The study of the organic codes, in short, is bringing to light new mechanisms that have operated in the history of life and new fundamental concepts in biology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319145358"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319145355"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 224, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.5.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rNp5BgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Code_Biology-sample-epub.acsm?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Code_Biology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rNp5BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "iWJM1JUEQ3oC", "etag": "GeNaMkQpeCY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iWJM1JUEQ3oC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Honeybees of Africa", "authors": ["H.

Indeed, it might be argued that it is only during the last 5-10 years that it has come to merit being regarded as a true science, rather than a collection of procedures for protecting the environment through management and monitoring of pollutant discharges into the environment. The term 'ecotoxicology' was first coined in the late sixties by Prof. Truhaut, a toxicologist who had the vision to recognize the importance of investigating the fate and effects of chemicals in ecosystems. At that time, ecotoxicology was considered a sub-discipline of medical toxicology. Subsequently, several attempts have been made to portray ecotoxicology in a more realistic light. Notably, both F. Moriarty (1988) and F. Ramade (1987) emphasized in their books the broad basis of ecotoxicology, encompassing chemical and radiation effects on all components of ecosystems. In doing so, they and others have shifted concern from direct chemical toxicity to man, to the far more subtle effects that pollutant chemicals exert on natural biota. Such effects potentially threaten the existence of all life on Earth. Although I have identified the sixties as the era when ecotoxicology was first conceived as a coherent subject area, it is important to acknowledge that studies that would now be regarded as ecotoxicological are much older. Wherever people's ingenuity has led them to change the face of nature significantly, it has not escaped them that a number of biological con sequences, often unfavourable, ensue.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789401123464"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9401123462"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 291, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-6GYyBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Animal_Biomarkers_as_Pollution_Indicator-sample-epub.acsm?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Animal_Biomarkers_as_Pollution_Indicator-sample-pdf.acsm?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6GYyBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VH5IjXFcNP8C", "etag": "1bfCz5TDH10", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VH5IjXFcNP8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Structure and Function of an Alpine Ecosystem", "subtitle": "Niwot Ridge, Colorado", "authors": ["William D.

The contributors to this volume - all with research and campaigning experience in this field - argue that the roots of the crisis of genetic erosion lie in the industrial system of the North. This book also refutes the notion that biodiversity conservation can only be achieved if commercial interests are used to \"value\" genetic resources.The authors argue that Third World peasants and forest dwellers have been the guardians and beneficiaries of the world's biodiversity. They warn of emerging biotechnologies which will erode biodiversity by increasing uniformity in production, and imposing intellectual property rights to turn life forms into private property.This provocative book also provides a critique of the global biodiversity convention which is being negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1856490548"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781856490542"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 123, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3bknBwXwrOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3bknBwXwrOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3bknBwXwrOUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=45&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3bknBwXwrOUC&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Biodiversity.html?hl=&id=3bknBwXwrOUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3bknBwXwrOUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QcstWYIcbHkC", "etag": "F6loJzJJ5vw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QcstWYIcbHkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Monocultures of the Mind", "subtitle": "Perspectives on Biodiversity and Biotechnology", "authors": ["Vandana Shiva"], "publisher": "Palgrave Macmillan", "publishedDate": "1993-06-15", "description": "Vandana Shiva has established herself as a leading independent thinker and voice for the South in that critically important nexus where questions of development strategy, the environment and the posititon of women in society coincide. In this new volume, she brings together her thinking on the protection of biodiversity, the implications of biotechnology, and the consequences for agriculture of the global pre-eminence of Western-style scientific knowledge. In lucid and accessible fashion, she examines the current threats to the planet's biodiversity and the environmental and human consequences of its erosion and replacement by monocultural production. She shows how the new Biodiversity Convention has been gravely undermined by a mixture of diplomatic dilution during the process of negotiation and Northern hi-tech interests making money out of the new biotechnologies. She explains what these technologies involve and gives examples of their impact in practice. She questions their claims to improving natural species for the good of all and highlights the ethical and environmental problems posed. Underlying her arguments is the view that the North's particular approach to scientific understanding has led to a system of monoculture in agriculture - a model that is not being foisted on the South, displacing its societies' ecologically sounder, indigenous and age-old experiences of truly sustainable food cultivation, forest management and animal husbandry. This rapidly accelerating process of technology and system transfer is impoverishing huge numbers of people, disrupting the social systems that provide them with security and dignity, and will ultimately result in a sterile planet in both North and South, In a policy intervention of potentially great significance, she calls instead for a halt, at international as well as local level, to the aid and market incentives to both large-scale destruction of habitats where biodiversity thrives and the introduction of centralised, homogenous systems of cultivation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1856492184"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781856492188"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 184, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Monocultures_of_the_Mind.html?hl=&id=QcstWYIcbHkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "gAzwCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "Lg28VjMnDNM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gAzwCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Course in Mathematical and Statistical Ecology", "authors": ["Anil Gore", "S.A.

This is in spite of the fact that the presence of these stresses of sizeable magnitudes has long been recognized as a primary cause of shakes and splits in logs as well as the warping of lumber sawn in the green condition. The presentation of the subject of growth stresses in trees presents some special problems due to the wide range of specialists who potentially might have an interest in the subject. For example, tree physiologists interested in questions such as the relation of mechanical stress to stem taper and the role of reaction wood and gravity forces in determining tree crown form encounter growth stress models. Silvi culturists interested in the relation ofthinning practices to wood quality find that wood properties are correlated with growth stress levels which are in turn significantly changed by cutting practices. Wood techno logists interested in the relation of residual growth stress gradients in green logs to the dimensional quality of sawn and seasoned lumber are forced to take a more quantitative approach to the effect of growth stresses than might have been the case in the past.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783662025116"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3662025116"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2wT8CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Growth_Stresses_and_Strains_in_Trees-sample-pdf.acsm?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2wT8CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rpza8aMabr4C", "etag": "bS19xAQGpHw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rpza8aMabr4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecology and Man in the Himalayas", "authors": ["A.

Winter survival, in particular, is a highly complex phenomenon, with regards to both stress factors and stress responses. The danger from winter cold is the result not only of its primary effect, i. e. the formation of ice in plant tissues; additional threats are presented by the freezing of water in and on the ground and by the load and duration ofthe snow cover. In recent years, a number of books and reviews on the subject of chilling and frost resistance in plants have appeared: all of these publications, however, concentrate principally on the mechanisms of injury and resistance to freezing at the cellular or molecular level. We are convinced that analysis of the ultrastructural and biochemical alterations in the cell and particularly in the plasma membrane during freezing is the key to understanding the limits of frost resistance and the mechanisms of cold acclimation. This is undoubtedly the immediate task facing those of us engaged in resistance research. It is nevertheless our opinion that, in addition to understanding the basic physiological events, we should be careful not to overlook the importance of the comparative aspects of the freezing processes, the components of stress avoidance and tolerance and the specific levels of resistance.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642717451"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642717454"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 321, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-dQzpCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Frost_Survival_of_Plants-sample-pdf.acsm?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dQzpCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_pIcG_aZGjsC", "etag": "XJaFEEgzqt0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_pIcG_aZGjsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecology of Java & Bali", "authors": ["Anthony J.

The world community considers the situation with the Aral Sea and all changes that occurred in its whereabouts in the recent decades as one of the most serious, if not disastrous anthropogenic environmental crises of the 20th century.

These feedback processes would, somehow, lead the earth as a whole into a new equilibrium. An equilibrium with life within, be it in an entirely changed environment. This is, indeed, let us be earnest: a functioning ecosystem. But what kind of ecosystem? The Gaia-hypothesis triggered a great deal of thought and discussion about what we actually require as an environment. Bio diversity as an abbreviation of biotic diversity has since become the focal point of societal concern. But again, when we think about it, we are not only interested in the sheer number of species on earth. We also have ')ther interests: nearby, in our backyards, in the surrounding countryside, and on the various locations where we would like to spend our holidays. We also want to preserve rare or characteristic species just for their own sake. In fact, we want species in viable populations to be part of communities that are self-maintaining in environments where they belong.

With this legal framework, the possibilities for protection of nature and landscape have now considerably improved in Switzerland. The most important aims of the Federal Law on Water Protection are to safeguard the natural habitats of the native flora and fauna and water as the habitat of aquatic organisms. This includes not only the preservation or restoration of water quality in lakes and rivers, but also, in rivers used for hydroelectricity, irrigation or as industrial or other water supplies, the maintenance of sufficient water to fulfill the minimal requirements for fish. However, good quality water in sufficient quan tities alone is not enough to guarantee the survival of fish.

These tree islands, however, have been one ofits least studied features. Because of their less flood tolerant vegetation, tree islands are one ofthe most sensitive components ofthe Everglades to changes in hydrology, and many tree islands have been lost during periods when water levels have been abnormally high or low. Their sensitivity to water level changes makes tree islands potentially one ofthe best and surest measures ofthe overall hydrologic health of the Everglades. Consequently, the maintenance of healthy, functioning tree islands and the restoration ofthose that have been lost will be an important performance measures that will be used tojudge the success ofthe Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). A symposium, Tree Islands ofthe Everglades, was held on July 14 and 15, 1998 at Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida. It was sponsored by Florida Center for Environmental Studies and the South Florida WaterManagement District. This was the first scientific meeting ever devoted to tree islands. The organizers of this symposium were Drs. Arnold van der Valk, Florida Center for Environmental Studies and Iowa State University, Fred Sklar, South Florida Water Management District, and Wiley Kitchens, United States Geological Survey.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400900011"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400900015"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 541, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=61&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Tree_Islands_of_the_Everglades-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UZ3sCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "u9IxDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "TOQ3tt2FKbA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/u9IxDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Fundamentals of Boundary-Layer Meteorology", "authors": ["Xuhui Lee"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2017-08-18", "description": "This textbook introduces a set of fundamental equations that govern the conservation of mass (dry air, water vapor, trace gas), momentum and energy in the lower atmosphere.

They are dynamic systems, producing limestone at the rate of 400-2,000 tons per hectare per year, and influencing the chemical balance of the world's oceans. Coral reefs have been around since before the prairies or other ecosystems of flowering plants existed, yet they vanish about a million years before other groups of organisms each time there is a global mass extinction. They return after each catastrophe, however, following a long period of absence. Although coral reefs are the most productive communities in the sea, the fisheries of coral reefs are among the most vulnerable to overexploitation. Despite having the power to create the most massive structures in the world made by living creatures (including man), the thin veneer of living tissue of coral reef is particularly sensitive to natural disturbances and effects of human activities. Coral reefs are the first to go during periods of climate change, but they have always come back. This combination of attributes, creative power and fragility, resilience and sensitivity, makes management of coral-reef systems a challenge to science. Over 70% of the coral reefs in the Caribbean and Asian waters have been degraded, and perhaps a third of the 400 species of corals in Japanese waters are in danger of local extinction unless effective coastal management practices are established. This book presents what is known about factors that shift the balance between accretion and erosion, recruitment and mortality, stony corals and filamentous algae, recovery and degradation--the life and death of coral reefs. Insight into the factors controlling the direction of these processes is essential for appropriate management decisions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0412035413"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780412035418"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 536, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hhcUJRSilwsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hhcUJRSilwsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hhcUJRSilwsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=64&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hhcUJRSilwsC&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Life_and_Death_Of_Coral_Reefs.html?hl=&id=hhcUJRSilwsC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Life_and_Death_Of_Coral_Reefs-sample-epub.acsm?id=hhcUJRSilwsC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Life_and_Death_Of_Coral_Reefs-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hhcUJRSilwsC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hhcUJRSilwsC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "2DHHEeWfOFMC", "etag": "Nk4pFtDgV4w", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2DHHEeWfOFMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Redstart", "subtitle": "An Ecological Poetics", "authors": ["Forrest Gander", "John Kinsella"], "publisher": "University of Iowa Press", "publishedDate": "2012-10", "description": "Poets Forrest Gander and John Kinsella offer an experiment, a collaborative volume of prose and poetry that investigates\u2014both thematically and formally\u2014the relationship between nature and culture, language and perception.

A fundamental objective of these books is to help the reader discem and implement man's stewardship of our environment and the world's renewable re sources. For we must strive to understand the relationship between man and nature, act to bring harmony to it, and nurture an environment that is both stable and productive. These objectives have often eluded us because the pursuit of other individual and societal goals has diverted us from a course of living in balance with the environment. At times, therefore, the environmental manager may have to exert restrictive control, which is usually best applied to man, not nature. Attempts to alter or hamess nature have often failed or backfired, as exemplified by the results of imprudent use of herbicides, fertilizers, water, and other agents. Each book in this series will shed light on the fundamental and applied aspects of environmental management.

Nutritional principles have been applied to improving individual health, athletic performance and longevity of humans and of their companion animals, and to maximizing agricultural efficiency by manipulating reproduction or growth of tissues such as muscle, hair or milk in livestock. Comparative nutrition borrows from these tra- tional approaches by applying similar techniques to studies of ecology and physiology of wildlife. Comparative approaches to nutrition integrate several levels of organization because the acquisition and flow of energy and nutrients connect individuals to populations, populations to communities, and communities to ecosystems. Integrative Wildlife Nutrition connects behavioral, morphological and biochemical traits of animals to the life history of species and thus the dynamics of populations. An integrated approach to nutrition provides a practical framework for understanding the interactions between food resources and wildlife popu- tions and for managing the harvest of abundant species and the conservation of threatened populations. This book is for students and professionals in animal physiology and ecology, conservation biology and wildlife management. It is based on our lectures, dem- strations and practical classes taught in the USA, Canada and Australia over the last three decades. Instructors can use Integrative Wildlife Nutrition as a text in wildlife and conservation biology programs, and as a reference source for related courses in wildlife ecology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540878858"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540878858"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 342, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&rdid=book-Ho45Vke8ifQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Integrative_Wildlife_Nutrition-sample-epub.acsm?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Integrative_Wildlife_Nutrition-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ho45Vke8ifQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QHgMqnqaW_YC", "etag": "5wk6+8oXNJI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QHgMqnqaW_YC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Invasive Species and Biodiversity Management", "authors": ["Odd Terje Sandlund", "Peter Johan Schei", "\u00c5slaug Viken"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2001-06-30", "description": "The invasive species problem will become increasingly important in the years to come.

The scope of the congresses was to create a platform for researchers at a time when the science of fire ecology was not yet recognized and established outside of North America and Australia. Whereas comprehensive information on the fire ecology of the northern boreal, the temperate, and the mediter ranean biotas is meanwhile available, it was recognized that conside rable gaps in information exist on the role of fire in tropical und sub tropical ecosystems. Thus it seemed timely to meet the growing scientific interest and public demand for reliable and updated infor mation and to synthesize the available knowledge of tropical fire ecology and the impact of tropical biomass burning on global eco system processes. The Third Symposium on Fire Ecology, again sponsored by the Volkswagen Foundation and held at Freiburg University in May 1989, was convened to prepare this first pantropical and multidisci plinary monograph on fire ecology!. The book, in which 46 scientists cooperated, analyzes those fire-related ecosystem processes which have not yet been described in a synoptic way. Following the editor's concept, duplication at previous efforts in describing tropical vegeta tion patterns and dynamics was avoided.

In four chapters Helgi Arst compares remote sensing data with data collected from similar examination of clean waters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the main radiative and remote sensing characteristics and provides discussion on the properties of optically active substances (OAS) in the water and their variability and concentration, drawing on original data obtained in the Baltic Sea region. Chapter 2 focuses on the investigation of the influence of surface oil slicks on the reflection and absorption of solar radiation for both calm and ruffled sea surfaces. A model is provided for determining the temperature and the reflected component in upwelling rough seas. Chapter 3 provides remote sensing results obtained mainly for the Baltic Sea region, including some lakes. Correlations between the concentrations of OAS, water transparency and total remote sensing reflectance are investigated. Chapter 4 deals with subsurface irradiance and optical classification of turbid waters. This chapter analyses the different criteria of the euphotic depth, drawing on a semi-empirical model for the estimation of underwater light scattering. The conclusion provides discussion on the results obtained.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "354000629X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540006299"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 231, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eY1RdNu8ugkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eY1RdNu8ugkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eY1RdNu8ugkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=75&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eY1RdNu8ugkC&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Optical_Properties_and_Remote_Sensing_of.html?hl=&id=eY1RdNu8ugkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Optical_Properties_and_Remote_Sensing_of-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eY1RdNu8ugkC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eY1RdNu8ugkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lIBUbyRUnaoC", "etag": "h7RJ4Il9jCw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lIBUbyRUnaoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Advances in Stromatolite Geobiology", "authors": ["Joachim Reitner", "Nadia-Val\u00e9rie Qu\u00e9ric", "Gernot Arp"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2010-10-22", "description": "Stromatolites are the most intriguing geobiological structures of the entire earth history since the beginning of the fossil record in the Archaean.

The field work was based primarily in Yellowstone National Park, using a field laboratory we set up in the city of W. Yellowstone, Montana. The laboratory work was carried out from 1965 through 1971 at Indiana University, Bloomington, and subsequently at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Although this research project began small, it quickly ramified in a wide variety of directions. The major thrust was an attempt to understand the ecology and evolutionary relationships of thermophilic microorganisms, but research also was done on biochemical, physiologic, and taxonomic aspects of thermophiles. Four new genera of thermophilic microorganisms have been discovered during the course of this 10-year period, three in my laboratory. In addition, a large amount of new information has been obtained on some thermophilic microorganisms that previously had been known. In later years, a considerable amount of work was done on Yellowstone algal bacterial mats as models for Precambrian stromatolites. In the broadest sense, the work could be considered geomicrobiological, or biogeochemi cal, and despite the extensive laboratory research carried out, the work was always firmly rooted in an attempt to understand thermophilic microorga nisms in their natural environments. Indeed, one of the prime motivations for initiating this work was a view that extreme environments would provide useful models for studying the ecology of microorganisms. As a result of this 10-year research project, I published over 100 papers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461262848"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461262844"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 465, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-y4_bBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Thermophilic_Microorganisms_and_Life_at-sample-pdf.acsm?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=y4_bBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DgVTDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "opPhfpYBXZk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DgVTDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Landscape Ecology for Sustainable Society", "authors": ["Sun-Kee Hong", "Nobukazu Nakagoshi"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2018-04-25", "description": "The research category of the landscape ecology, which researches the structure, functions, and the spatio-temporal changes of the ecological landscapes, has now been contributing to the human life and the shifts of the socio-economic paradigm. Global warming has been influencing the universal life patterns of the mankind which have been maintained in the past several hundreds of years. And it has been having the influences on the international social problems and economic problems. Although the diverse plans for adapting to the climate changes have been the topics of the conservations among the ecologists internationally, it is the reality that the speed of the changes of the environment has been quicker than the time it takes to complete the solutions. In order to maintain the sustainable earth and the sustainable society, the role of the landscape ecology has been coming to the fore. Especially, the theories and the methodologies of the landscape ecology have been applied to the multidisciplinary researches by going beyond the research category of ecology, including the maximization of the efficiencies of the land spaces, the management of the ecological space (habitats) in which the biological diversity can be maintained, the utilization of the resources that are absolutely needed by the human beings (Here, it is compressed to water, energy, and food), etc. and until reaching the human society. It is considered that, to that extent, the utilizations and the applications of the landscape ecology are very much needed for the diagnoses and the evaluations of the global environmental problems which have been proceeded with rapidly in the modernity. This book is not comprised of any general remarks that explain the theories and the methods of the landscape ecology. Already, based on the basic theories of the landscape ecology, the writers have conducted the investigations on the farm villages, the cities, and the coastal ecosystems. And, through the space analyses and interpretations, the structure and functions of the landscapes were analyzed. Of course, in this book, too, the diverse ecosystems and the landscape ecological methodologies regarding the land use have been presented. However, the core of this book focuses more on what role the landscape ecology must play for the materialization of a sustainable society in the future. At the farm villages, the sustainable agriculture will be presented, and, at the cities, the discussions on the green networks and the energies will be proceeded with. Also, regarding the coasts and the seas, a thesis on the safety of the life zones of the residents adjacent to the sea and on the conservation of the island ecosystems will be presented. The sustainable society is a system that is formed by having the sustainable development as a basis. It is considered to be one aspect within a kind of a sustainable process with regard to which the natural world and the human world coexist and are in a symbiotic relationship harmoniously. In order to maintain the biodiversity, the reasonable adjustments of the human activities, like the use of the resources, are absolutely needed. Without the biological resources, the cultural diversity of the human beings, too, cannot exist. Consequentially, recently and internationally, there are a lot of the case examples that express the biocultural diversity by linking the biological diversity with the cultural diversity. In this book, the role of the landscape ecology as an academic link which can connect the two possible, if possible, is highly expected. It is, indeed, the biocultural landscape. It can be said that this concept, also, is the interconnection of the multidisciplinary spaces that must be dealt with in the modern landscape ecology. Through this book, it is intended to present a new directionality which can contribute to the sustainable society at the same time as the organization of the theories and the methods of the landscape ecology.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319743288"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319743287"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 383, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DgVTDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Landscape_Ecology_for_Sustainable_Societ-sample-epub.acsm?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Landscape_Ecology_for_Sustainable_Societ-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DgVTDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TDglzNsa8ZQC", "etag": "C6Cm1TeRPIk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TDglzNsa8ZQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "God is Not 'green'", "subtitle": "A Re-examination of Eco-theology", "authors": ["Adrian Michael Hough"], "publisher": "Gracewing Publishing", "publishedDate": "1997", "description": "A thought-provoking account challenging the idea that Christianity has little to say in the ecological arena.

There is dismay, followed by outcry, and demands to Authority. Authority remembers its experts or appoints some: they ought to know. The experts advise a Cure. The Cure can be almost anything: holy water from Mecca, a Government Commis sion, a culture of bacteria, poison, prayers denunciatory or tactful, a new god, a trap, a Pied Piper. The Cures have only one thing in common: with a little patience they always work. They have never been known entirely to fail. Likewise they have never been known to prevent the next outbreak. For the cycle of abundance and scarcity has a rhythm of its own, and the Cures are applied just when the plague of insects is going to abate through its own loss of momentum. -Abridged, with insects in place of voles, from C. Elton, 1924, Voles, Mice and Lemmings, with permission of Oxford University Press This book is an enquiry into the \"natural rhythms\" of insect abundance in forested ecosystems and into the forces that give rise to these rhythms. Forests form unique environ ments for such studies because one can find them growing under relatively natural (pri meval) conditions as well as under the domination of human actions. Also, the slow growth and turnover rates of forested ecosystems enable us to investigate insect popula tion dynamics in a plant environment that remains relatively constant or changes only slowly, this in contrast to agricultural systems, where change is often drastic and frequent.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781489907899"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1489907890"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 604, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=80&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Jk30BwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Dynamics_of_Forest_Insect_Populations-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Jk30BwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "4v0cTzwIe2gC", "etag": "zTQi5cjtFBc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/4v0cTzwIe2gC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Living Waters", "subtitle": "Reading the Rivers of the Lower Great Lakes", "authors": ["Margaret Wooster"], "publisher": "SUNY Press", "publishedDate": "2009-01-29", "description": "Fascinating stories based on the author\u2019s exploration of eight rivers in New York and Qu\u00e9bec.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0791477045"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780791477045"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 199, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4v0cTzwIe2gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4v0cTzwIe2gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4v0cTzwIe2gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4v0cTzwIe2gC&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Living_Waters.html?hl=&id=4v0cTzwIe2gC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Living_Waters-sample-epub.acsm?id=4v0cTzwIe2gC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Living_Waters-sample-pdf.acsm?id=4v0cTzwIe2gC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4v0cTzwIe2gC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Ky0GaV6xYaoC", "etag": "Zm/oO4uwIy0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Ky0GaV6xYaoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Population and Land Use, Cover Dynamics in the Volta River Basin of Ghana", "subtitle": "1960 -

Generations of researchers have investigated one of the last remaining evolutionary paradoxes: why sex exists at all. Given that sexual reproduction is costly from an evolutionary point of view, one could wonder why not all animals and plants reproduce asexually. Dozens of contemporary hypotheses attempt to explain the prevalence of sex and its advantages and predict the early extinction of fully asexual lineages. The major theme of this book is: what is the fate of animal and plant groups in which sex is lost? Initial chapters discuss theory behind asexual life: what major disadvantages do asexual groups have to face, what are the genetic and ecological consequences and what does this theory predict for more applied aspects of asexual life, for example in agricultural pests, diseases as well as in cultural crops such as grapes. Cases studies in many animals (focusing on both invertebrates and vertebrates) and plants reveal parallel, but also singularly novel adaptations to the absence of meiosis and syngamy. And last but not least, are asexuals really doomed to early extinction or do genuine ancient asexuals exist? This book assembles contributions from the most important research groups dealing with asexual evolution in eukaryotes. It is a milestone in research on parthenogenesis and will be useful to undergraduate as well as graduate students and to senior researchers in all fields of evolutionary biology, as the paradox of sex remains its queen of problems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "904812770X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789048127702"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 615, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=84&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 18054, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 18054, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&rdid=book-GaWD_OtE0AMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18054000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18054000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lost_Sex-sample-epub.acsm?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Lost_Sex-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GaWD_OtE0AMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Fn8Vs3UWP2sC", "etag": "BXIqMIWSiKw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Fn8Vs3UWP2sC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Most Beautiful Roof in the World", "subtitle": "Exploring the Rainforest Canopy", "authors": ["Kathryn Lasky"], "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "publishedDate": "1997", "description": "Describes the work of Meg Lowman in the rainforest canopy, an area unexplored until the last ten years and home to previously unknown species of plants and animals.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0152008977"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780152008970"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 48, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Nonfiction"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fn8Vs3UWP2sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fn8Vs3UWP2sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fn8Vs3UWP2sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=85&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fn8Vs3UWP2sC&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Most_Beautiful_Roof_in_the_World.html?hl=&id=Fn8Vs3UWP2sC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Fn8Vs3UWP2sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CbAbXM20bBcC", "etag": "OJ8DiIHsL2A", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CbAbXM20bBcC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biogeography and Ecology in South-America", "authors": ["E.J.

Most of these discussions deal with decidedly specialist themes and the editors have been particularly concerned to ensure that the authors enjoyed the greatest possible freedom in the preparation of their work in order that different points of view and interpretations, together with some questions of controversy, may be clarified. This also applies, of course, to the several chapters in which general themes (geographical substance, climate, geology, vegetation, amongst others) are discussed. Since the amount of material available is too great to enable one to aspire to a presentation of the complete biogeographical and ecological picture, this procedure seems expedient. However, these two volumes could well be regarded as being a preparatory work for just such a complete description. Each of the separate technical contributions refers to the continent as a whole, in order to characterise it as such from the viewpoint of the specialist. For this reason it was necessary to forgo special discussions of particular regions or types of landscape, although South America of all places is remarkably rich in unique regional phenom- ena, the altiplano of Peru and Bolivia, the relict forests of Fray Jorge, the shrub formations of Tierra del Fuego, the lakes of the High Andes, for example.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9061930715"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789061930716"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 497, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CbAbXM20bBcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CbAbXM20bBcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CbAbXM20bBcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CbAbXM20bBcC&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Biogeography_and_Ecology_in_South_Americ.html?hl=&id=CbAbXM20bBcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Biogeography_and_Ecology_in_South_Americ-sample-pdf.acsm?id=CbAbXM20bBcC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CbAbXM20bBcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "sQ3vCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "Xodul4C2c80", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/sQ3vCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Novel aspects of the biology of Chrysomelidae", "authors": ["Pierre H.

At least 37,000 species of leaf beetles belonging to 19 subfamilies have now been described, and more probably remain to be discovered, especially in the tropics. Many species are familiar agricultural pests. The Colorado potato beetle, the cereal beetle, flea beetle and the corn root worms are but a few of the well known pests. Because of the economic importance and biological diversity, chrysomelids are an important taxonomic group for scientific inquiry. This book is divided into eight parts, entitled palaeontology, larvae and larval biology, trophic selection, genetics and evolution defence mechanisms, anatomy and reproduction, pathogens and natural enemies, and general studies in biology. The biologies of agricultural and forestry pests, Leptinotarsa, Plagiodera, Entomoscelis, Paropsis, Mecistomela and Aspidomorpha are dealt with in detail. Others, such as Timarcha and those in the poorly known Megalopodinae, are covered in Part VIII. In this volume the American, European, Asian and Australian fauna occupy the greatest part.

One species, the rice brown planthopper, is among the most economically important pests in Asia. In past decades, government policies encouraged the control of rice planthoppers with synthetic pesticides, a tactic which promoted insecticide resistance and often led to the pesticide-induced resurgence of pest populations. To deter planthopper outbreaks, a more ecologically sound management strategy is being implemented, one based on a thorough investigation of population dynamics, natural enemies, and the genetics of host plant and insecticide adaptation. In the natural habitats of North America and Europe, scientists have also used planthoppers as model organisms to test ecological and evolutionary theory. The consequence of these diverse studies is an extremely scattered literature on planthoppers that has never been synthesized from an ecological perspective. This volume summarizes what is known about planthopper ecology and biological control. It takes a theoretical approach yet is deeply concerned with the application of theory to the practical problems of pest management.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461523956"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461523958"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 799, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-N7X4BwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Planthoppers-sample-pdf.acsm?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N7X4BwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_jJdDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "zCKoWWXD94Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_jJdDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Practical Ecology", "authors": ["David Slingsby", "Ceridwen Cook"], "publisher": "Macmillan International Higher Education", "publishedDate": "2016-01-07", "description": "This book offers accessible information, practical help and clear guidance on the use of ecological techniques included in all A level biology courses.

Just how long nobody knows for sure but the prehistoric inhabitants of Terra Amata, on the Mediterranean coast near Nice, ate marine intertidal animals at least 300 000 years ago. Similar impressive evidence, going back to at least 100000 years, exists for prehistoric man's consumption of intertidal animals along the South African coast. However, early man's dependence on intertidal resources probably goes back much further in time. During the last 2 million or so years temperate Eurasia experienced some 20 glaciations interspersed by warm equable periods. Different modes of life were open to man in colonizing the northern temperate zone. One was to become a \"big-game\" hunter, specializing, for example, on mammoths, the other to exploit marine intertidal resources. Of the two, probably the shoreline offered an easier environment for an original scavenging food-gatherer.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642782831"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642782833"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 177, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-eLX8CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rocky_Shores_Exploitation_in_Chile_and_S-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eLX8CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "aVjDtSmJqhAC", "etag": "ra0JCH6+1Q4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/aVjDtSmJqhAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Practical Guide to Ecological Modelling", "subtitle": "Using R as a Simulation Platform", "authors": ["Karline Soetaert", "Peter M.

Yet for many ecologists it is still problematic to apply modelling in their research. In our experience, the major problem is at the conceptual level: proper understanding of what a model is, how ecological relations can be translated consistently into mathematical equations, how models are solved, steady states calculated and interpreted. Many textbooks jump over these conceptual hurdles to dive into detailed formulations or the mathematics of solution. This book attempts to fill that gap. It introduces essential concepts for mathematical modelling, explains the mathematics behind the methods, and helps readers to implement models and obtain hands-on experience. Throughout the book, emphasis is laid on how to translate ecological questions into interpretable models in a practical way. The book aims to be an introductory textbook at the undergraduate-graduate level, but will also be useful to seduce experienced ecologists into the world of modelling. The range of ecological models treated is wide, from Lotka-Volterra type of principle-seeking models to environmental or ecosystem models, and including matrix models, lattice models and sequential decision models. All chapters contain a concise introduction into the theory, worked-out examples and exercises. All examples are implemented in the open-source package R, thus taking away problems of software availability for use of the book.

Because of long distance transport to pristine areas of cadmium, lead, copper, and zinc in relatively large quantities, these elements have an extra section on natural ecosystems. A blend of pictorial and tabular data are provided to enhance understanding of the relevant information being conveyed.

The considerable knowledge of what to eat and where it could be found has been passed down since prehistoric times by oral tradition in many societies - in Britain it is still unwise to eat shellfish in months without an 'r' in them. Over the last three hundred years or so we have seen the formalization of science and this of course has touched intertidal ecology. Linnaeus classified specimens collected from the seashore and many common species (Patella vulgata L. , Mytilus edulis L. , Littorina littorea (L. )) bear his imprint because he formally described, named and catalogued them. Early natural historians described zonation patterns in the first part of the 19th century (Audouin and Milne-Edwards, 1832), and the Victorians became avid admirers and collectors of shore animals and plants with the advent of the new fashion of seaside holidays (Gosse, 1856; Kingsley, 1856). As science became professionalized towards the end of the century, marine biologists took advantage of low tides to gain easy access to marine life for taxonomic work and classical studies of functional morphology. The first serious studies of the ecology of the shore were made at this time (e. g.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400914896"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "940091489X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 356, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11764.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-KLltCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11764600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Intertidal_Ecology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KLltCQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y3XtgLKySgYC", "etag": "/GM9UmBpnIg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y3XtgLKySgYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Critique for Ecology", "authors": ["Robert Henry Peters", "Robert H.

It is directed at contemporary ecology, but would apply to any science or indeed any statement that claims to contain information. Application of simple criteria to judge the information in ecological statements reveals deep inadequacies in the science. Furthermore, the complexity of the contemporary field of ecology and the mistraining of a generation of ecologists has obscured its weakness. As a result, many ecologists are unaware of the failings of the science although others are deeply concerned for the future of the field. The author, Professor Peters, argues that a return to simple question of fact, to observations, and to questions of general relevance to science and society can make ecology a useful, practical and informative science.

The author describes major trends in species richness, along with uncertainties in current knowledge. The various possible explanations for past and present species patterns are discussed and explained in an even-handed and accessible way. The implications of global climate change and habitat loss are considered, along with current strategies for preserving what we have. This book examines the state of current understanding of species richness patterns and their explanations. As well as the present day world, it deals with diversification and extinction, in the conservation of species richness, and the difficulties of assessing how many species remain to be discovered. The scientifically compelling subject of vegetation-climate interaction is considered in depth. Written in an accessible style, the author offers an up-to-date, rigorous and yet eminently comprehensible overview of the ecology and biogeography of species richness. He departs from the often heavy approach of earlier texts, without sacrificing rigor and depth of information and analysis. Prefacing with the aims of the book, Chapter 1 opens with an explanation of latitudinal gradients, including a description of major features of the striking gradients in species richness, exceptions to the rule, explanations, major theories and field and experimental tests. The following chapter plumbs the depth of time, including the nature of the fossil record, broad timescale diversity patterns, ecosystem changes during mass extinctions and glaciations and their influence on species richness. Chapters 3 and 4 consider hotspots and local scale patterns in species richness while Chapter 5 looks at the limitations and uncertainties on current estimates of richness, the last frontiers of species diversity and the process of identifying new life forms. The last three chapters cover humans and extinctions in history and prehistory, current habitat and global change, including the greenhouse effect, and the race to preserve what we still have, including parks, gene banks and laws.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540742784"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540742786"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 386, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fPAO6kfbizMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&rdid=book-fPAO6kfbizMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Species_Richness-sample-pdf.acsm?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fPAO6kfbizMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DbHWCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "3qd1AyVMCjE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DbHWCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Boundaries of a Complex World", "authors": ["Andrei Ludu"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2016-03-23", "description": "The central theme of this book is the extent to which the structure of the free dynamical boundaries of a system controls the evolution of the system as a whole. Applying three orthogonal types of thinking - mathematical, constructivist and morphological, it illustrates these concepts using applications to selected problems from the social and life sciences, as well as economics. In a broader context, it introduces and reviews some modern mathematical approaches to the science of complex systems. Standard modeling approaches (based on non-linear differential equations, dynamic systems, graph theory, cellular automata, stochastic processes, or information theory) are suitable for studying local problems. However they cannot simultaneously take into account all the different facets and phenomena of a complex system, and new approaches are required to solve the challenging problem of correlations between phenomena at different levels and hierarchies, their self-organization and memory-evolutive aspects, the growth of additional structures and are ultimately required to explain why and how such complex systems can display both robustness and flexibility.

Further, carrion consumption by scavengers, i.e. scavenging, supports key ecosystem functions and services such as recycling nutrients and energy, disposing of carcasses and regulating disease spread. Yet, unlike dead plant matter, dead animal decomposition has received little attention in the fields of ecology, wildlife conservation and environmental management, and as a result the management of carrion for maintaining biodiversity and functional ecosystems has been limited. This book addresses the main ecological patterns and processes relating to the generation and consumption of carrion both in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It also discusses a number of conservation concerns and associated management issues, particularly regarding the increasing role of human-mediated carrion in ecosystems. Lastly, the book outlines future research lines in carrion ecology and management, and identifies the major challenges for scavengers and scavenging processes in the Anthropocene.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030165017"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030165019"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 281, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-oqCkDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Carrion_Ecology_and_Management-sample-epub.acsm?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Carrion_Ecology_and_Management-sample-pdf.acsm?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oqCkDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "eAfXuTL5XsgC", "etag": "RV1QRLYIiLU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eAfXuTL5XsgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Wild Urban Woodlands", "subtitle": "New Perspectives for Urban Forestry", "authors": ["Ingo Kowarik", "Stefan K\u00f6rner"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2005", "description": "This book provides a first overview of the phemonemon of post-industrial urban wilderness: urban landscapes once shaped by heavy industry that are being re-colonized naturally by forests.

The contents also highlight efforts to conserve and promote traditional forest management practices that balance the environmental, economic and social objectives of forest management.

At first glance it would seem a daring enterprise to deal with the complex processes in society using concepts and methods first developed in physics. But over the past decade it has been shown that there is a large class of phenomena in a variety of fields to which unifying concepts can be applied. This is particulary true of situations in which a system composed of many parts or individuals acquires a new structure on macroscopic scales. Indeed, this is the definition of synergetics which I formulated more than a decade ago, and which formed the basis of my survey on the profound analogies in the behaviour of complex systems, includ ing those of sociology (H. Haken: Synergetics. An Introduction, Volume 1 of this series). As I have pointed out on many occasions, the universal validity of these concepts is neither accidental nor is it caused by a mere extension of physical rules to other fields, but is instead a consequence of deep-rooted struc tural properties of systems of interacting parts which are due to rigorous mathe maticallaws. Generally speaking, concepts and methods originally used in physics can be applied to sociological phenomena in two ways.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642817892"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642817890"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 220, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-dijqCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Concepts_and_Models_of_a_Quantitative_So-sample-pdf.acsm?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dijqCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "H76QTE0FRM0C", "etag": "ZiCwCVWVGUo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/H76QTE0FRM0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "World Development Report 2008 (Overview)", "subtitle": "Agriculture for Development", "publisher": "World Bank Publications", "publishedDate": "2007", "description": "This edition of the Annual World Bank Conference on Development Economics presents selected papers from the ABCDE Meetings, held May 29-30, 2006, in Tokyo, Japan.

The thirty eight authors present current studies on the interrelation of plants-animals. This topic has always fascinated man, as evidenced even by the first chapters of Genesis. The world of aqueous and terrestrial fauna appeared on early earth only after the flora covered the areas with the green pigmentation. Almost all life depends upon sunlight via the photosynthesis of the botanical world. We read abut the harnessing of bee pollination of crops to make it an essential component of modern agriculture endeavor. Some plants seduce insects for pollination by their appearance (e.g., disguised orchids entice visitors); there is the production of sweet nectar as a bribe in flowers to attract bees, butterflies, and honey-sucking birds. A particular outstanding phenomena are the carnivorous plants that have developed trapping and digesting systems of insects and higher animals.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9048193168"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789048193165"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 532, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.10.10.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 19706, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 19706, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&rdid=book-Rl0ER01ZI8cC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19706000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19706000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/All_Flesh_Is_Grass-sample-epub.acsm?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/All_Flesh_Is_Grass-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Rl0ER01ZI8cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DBlH_O4cYXUC", "etag": "c59vkYQQxlE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DBlH_O4cYXUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Red Clover Science", "authors": ["N.L.

Sati, Manoj Tiwari"], "publisher": "Daya Books", "publishedDate": "2008", "description": "Many plants benefit greatly from symbiotic relationship with soil fungi known as mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi live on and in the root systems of plants and provide nutrients to the plant in exchange for carbohydrates exuded by the plants. Some of the ecological uses of mycorrhizae include (i) enchancing plant growth and disease resistance (ii) improving transplant success (iii) building soil structure (iv) reducing fertilizer dependency and (v) accelerating revegetation of degraded lands. While over 80 percent of the terrestrial plants show mycorrhizal association, the depth of its application towards industries seems to be under-exploited. Moreover, severe deforestation and land degradation have removed the host plants from the habitats giving way to loss of diversity of the mycorrhizal fungi. Particularly, this problem is acute in the tropical region of the world, where various naturals calamities such as floods, landslides, fire, etc in addition to the human exploitation of natural resources have degraded the major part of the ecosystems. Although, causes are known, Strategies to rebuild the degraded systems remain bliss. There are many national and international journals that bring out the information about the mycorrhizal fungi and their symbiotic relationship with plants but the recent knowledge is almost in scattered state. This scattered information could be kept in a book to provide up-to-date information about mycorrhizal research especially being done in different corner of India. This book is a very selective monograph on mycorrhizae covering its different aspects. It is excellent collection of 21 articles dealing with different disciplines of mycorrhizae and mycorrhizal research carried out by Indian scientists. In order to consummate the collective ideas on mycorrhizal association, its diversity and applications, a number of themes have been identified for this book, including (i) Biodiversity and Ecological issues on mycorrhizal association (ii) Physiology and molecular biology of plant-mycorrhizal fungal interactions (iii) Potential industrial applications. It is doubtless to say that this book would be very useful to all scientists, teachers, students and readers whosoever in interested on mycology and mycological literature.

As a result, they have come to discover the field's power to illuminate present ecological patterns and processes. Ecologists are now investigating whether phylogenetic diversity is a better measure of ecosystem health than more traditional metrics like species diversity, whether it can predict the future structure and function of communities and ecosystems, and whether conservationists might prioritize it when formulating conservation plans. In Phylogenetic Ecology, Nathan G. Swenson synthesizes this nascent field's major conceptual, methodological, and empirical developments to provide students and practicing ecologists with a foundational overview. Along the way, he highlights those realms of phylogenetic ecology that will likely increase in relevance--such as the burgeoning subfield of phylogenomics--and shows how ecologists might lean on these new perspectives to inform their research programs.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226671505"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "022667150X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RNu0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RNu0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RNu0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RNu0DwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Phylogenetic_Ecology.html?hl=&id=RNu0DwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RNu0DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KFbaBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "w8zzdIJZ+IY", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KFbaBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecoaccidents", "authors": ["John Cairns"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-03-13", "description": "Dr. Hueck explains in the \"History and Development of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop\" some ideas on the genesis of the Workshop. The reader should understand that this volume is a preliminary analysis of a problem that has not received much attention. The case histories, for example, are illustrative because one volume cannot include all histories, or even those in Europe. Consequently, case histories are lacking on many parts of the world, including central Europe and North America, not because these are unimportant or less disastrous ecologically than the case histories covered, but because selecting only a few illustrative cases was possible. The geographic and ecological coverage was originally much broader, but, unfortunately, some participants were unable to attend and this resulted in an even more skewed distribution geographically. However, participants generally agreed that the information necessary to analyze the problem was covered in sufficient depth by those in attendance and that other case histories would have been interesting, but would probably not have caused substantive changes in the conclusions or recommendations. The Workshop organizers did not selectively choose people, companies, or countries to the exclusion of others. The committee selected a broad array of people, countries, and industries, and the participants were those able to corne, prepare a manuscript, and meet the other conditions. Thus, what appears to be a skewed distribution was not planned as such, but was the consequence of people being unable to attend for various reasons.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461594505"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461594502"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 164, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Ecology&hl=&cd=118&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-KFbaBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Ecoaccidents-sample-pdf.acsm?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KFbaBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DQ2RXVQxtk4C", "etag": "KLF1gvnB9bo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DQ2RXVQxtk4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Magic School Bus Hops Home", "subtitle": "A Book about Animal Habitats", "authors": ["Patricia Relf", "Joanna Cole"], "publisher": "Scholastic Inc.", "publishedDate": "1995", "description": "Oh, no!
