The metal adds a third dimension to the planar aromatic compounds and coordination of a metal to an arene thus not only altering the reactivity of ring-carbons and substituents but also makes possible reactions that lead to chiral non-racemic products. This book, organized in nine chapters and written by leading scientists in the field provides the reader with an up-to-date treatise on the subject organized according to reaction type and use. It covers the wide spectrum of arene activation: from the electrophilic activation of h6-bound arene\u00ef\u2fec by p-Lewis acid metal complex fragments, to reactions of nucleophilic h2-coordinated arene complexes. The preparation of complexes is detailed, as are the scope, limitations and challenges of reactions in contemporary p-arene metal chemistry with special attention given to asymmetric transformations. The emphasis of the book is on transformations of interest to organic synthesis and on the use of the complexes as catalysts or as chiral ligands.

Biswas", "H.K.

Knowledge has accumulated on the mecha nisms of the microbial infection of plants, which can lead to either disease or resistance. The mechanisms developed by plants to interact with microbes, whether viruses, bacteria, or fungi, involve events that can lead to symbiotic association or to disease or tumor formation. Cell death caused by pathogen infection has been of great interest for many years because of its association with plant resistance. There appear to be two types of plant cell death associated with pathogen infection, a rapid hypersensitive cell death localized at the site of infection during an incompatible interaction between a resistant plant and an avirulent pathogen, and a slow, normosensitive plant cell death that spreads beyond the site of infection during some compatible interactions involving a susceptible plant and a virulent, necrogenic pathogen. Plants possess a number of defense mechanisms against infection, such as (i) production of phytoalexin, (ii) formation of hydrolases, (iii) accumulation of hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein and lignin deposition, (iv) production of pathogen-related proteins, (v) produc tion of oligosaccharides, jasmonic acid, and various other phenolic substances, and (vi) production of toxin-metabolizing enzymes. Based on these observations, insertion of a single suitable gene in a particular plant has yielded promising results in imparting resistance against specific infection or disease. It appears that a signal received after microbe infection triggers different signal transduction pathways.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306456788"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306456787"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 440, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Plant_Microbe_Interactions.html?hl=&id=Be9fgMzp4WwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Plant_Microbe_Interactions-sample-epub.acsm?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Plant_Microbe_Interactions-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Be9fgMzp4WwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "SuXi2WtHnwQC", "etag": "oBhtD6B+V1c", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/SuXi2WtHnwQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Guide to Protein Isolation", "authors": ["C.

Neverthelens, it is important to strike a level of \"fundamentalness\" appropriate to the task in hand. For example, an in-depth study of the mechanics of motor cars would tell one nothing about the dynamics of traffic. Traffic exists on a different \"level\" - it is dependent upon the existence of motor vehicles but the physics and mathematics of traffic can be adequately addressed by considering motor vehicles as mobile \"blobs\", with no consideration of how they become mobile. To start a discourse on traffic with a consideration of the mechanics of motor vehicles would thus be inappropropriate. In writing this volume, I have wrestled with the question of the appropriate level at which to address the physics underlying many of the techniques used in protein isolation. I have tried to strike a level as would be used by a mechanic (with perhaps a slight leaning towards an engineer) - i.e. a practical level, offering appropriate insight but with minimal mathematics. Some people involved in biochemical research have a minimal grounding in chemistry and physics and so I have tried to keep it as simple as possible.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1402012241"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402012242"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 249, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SuXi2WtHnwQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SuXi2WtHnwQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SuXi2WtHnwQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SuXi2WtHnwQC&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Guide_to_Protein_Isolation.html?hl=&id=SuXi2WtHnwQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Guide_to_Protein_Isolation-sample-pdf.acsm?id=SuXi2WtHnwQC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SuXi2WtHnwQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "68SaDOL58qUC", "etag": "6yLknoJqONw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/68SaDOL58qUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Applications of Gene-Based Technologies for Improving Animal Production and Health in Developing Countries", "authors": ["Harinder P.S.

The first 10 years of the twenty-first century were characterized by rapid advances in our grasp of the functional role of cancer-specific metabolism as well as the underlying molecular pathways.

This single-species model is refined and generalized by examining the mechanisms of population regulation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1402068190"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402068195"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 222, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.6.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E7R2q19X3toC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E7R2q19X3toC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E7R2q19X3toC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E7R2q19X3toC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E7R2q19X3toC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4200.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4200.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E7R2q19X3toC&rdid=book-E7R2q19X3toC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4200800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4200800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Population_Systems-sample-epub.acsm?id=E7R2q19X3toC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Population_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=E7R2q19X3toC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=E7R2q19X3toC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "gSI_AAAAQBAJ", "etag": "QhY/I0uxOKc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gSI_AAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Vesicle Trafficking in Cancer", "authors": ["Yosef Yarden", "Gabi Tarcic"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-04-02", "description": "Endocytosis and vesicular trafficking determine the landscape of the cell\u2019s exterior, namely the density of surface molecules, such as receptors for growth factors and cytokines, adhesion molecules like integrins and cadherins, and a plethora of nutrient carriers. Hence, endocytosis is involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion and migration, as well as metabolism. To exploit these fundamental processes, malignancies subtly and multiply manipulate the endocytosis and the subsequent trafficking of protein cargoes. This is achieved by simultaneously altering the cytoskeleton, vesicle budding, cargo sorting and intracellular degradation. By highlighting the underlying molecular processes and concentrating on specific examples, this book reviews the recent emergence of derailed endocytosis and vesicular trafficking as a landmark of cancer. In-depth understanding of this common feature of tumors might lead the way to drug-induced strategies, able to rectify intracellular trafficking in cancer.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461465287"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461465281"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 393, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 15812, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 15812, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gSI_AAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15812000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 15812000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vesicle_Trafficking_in_Cancer-sample-epub.acsm?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Vesicle_Trafficking_in_Cancer-sample-pdf.acsm?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gSI_AAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DtvcBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "xj3cOCTvWNc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DtvcBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Ecotoxicology", "subtitle": "Pesticides and beneficial organisms", "authors": ["Peter T.

The importance of computational function prediction is increasing because more and more large scale biological data, including genome sequences, protein structures, protein-protein interaction data, microarray expression data, and mass spectrometry data, are awaiting biological interpretation. Traditionally when a genome is sequenced, function annotation of genes is done by homology search methods, such as BLAST or FASTA. However, since these methods are developed before the genomics era, conventional use of them is not necessarily most suitable for analyzing a large scale data. Therefore we observe emerging development of computational gene function prediction methods, which are targeted to analyze large scale data, and also those which use such omics data as additional source of function prediction. In this book, we overview this emerging exciting field. The authors have been selected from 1) those who develop novel purely computational methods 2) those who develop function prediction methods which use omics data 3) those who maintain and update data base of function annotation of particular model organisms (E. coli), which are frequently referred", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400708815"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400708815"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 310, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.7.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdid=book-UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-epub.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "PkEGCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "jqR+tII8I24", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/PkEGCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Food Hydrocolloids", "subtitle": "Structures, Properties, and Functions", "authors": ["K.

Food hydrocolloids have been widely used for controlling in various food products their viscoelasticity, emulsification, gelation, dispersion, thickening and many other functions. An international journal, FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS, launched in 1986 has published a number of stimulating papers, and established an active forum for promoting the interaction between academics and industrialists and for combining basic scientific research with industrial development. Although there have been various research groups in many food processing areas in Japan, such as fish paste (kamaboko, surimi), soybean curd (tofu), agar jelly dessert, kuzu starch jelly, kimizu (Japanese style mayonnaise), their activities have been conducted in isolation of one another. The interaction between the various research groups operating in the various sectors has been weak. Symposia on food hydrocolloids have been organised on several occasions in Japan since 1985. Professor Glyn O. Phillips, the Chief Executive Editor of FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS, suggested to us that we should organise an international conference on food hydrocolloids. We discussed it on many occasions, and eventually decided to organise such a meeting, and extended the scope to include recent development in proteinaceous hydrocolloids, and their nutritional aspects, in addition to polysaccharides and emulsions.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461524861"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461524865"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 510, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=27&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-PkEGCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Food_Hydrocolloids-sample-pdf.acsm?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=PkEGCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "ViMXvDzPeKUC", "etag": "L/vZMZopHTg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ViMXvDzPeKUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Self-Assembly Monolayer Structures of Lipids and Macromolecules at Interfaces", "authors": ["K.S.

In most of the books, the objective type questions judge the students on the basis of their ability to memorize, because of the way they are formulated. It is important to be able to remember the year of historical events, the scientists involved and who named what to make one remember the landmark contributions of the people on a particular subject. Along with these kinds of questions, majority of the questions in this book have been designed to assess the candidate's understanding of the subject. It is perhaps for the first time where questions have four to six choice statements, which are to be understood to find the right answer. One has to think and remember what he has learnt to be able to answer these questions. There are some books on objective type questions on the subject of Plant Breeding and a very few on Genetics but there is hardly any book, which deals with Tissue Culture, Biotechnology, Biochemistry or Forestry. All these subjects are related as many postgraduate students of Genetics and Plant Breeding take Biotechnology as a minor subject whereas those of Biotechnology take Biochemistry or Genetics and Plant Breeding as a minor subject. Also, undergraduates in agricultural universities study courses on all these subjects including Forestry", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9788189866884"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "8189866885"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 496, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biochemistry"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.1", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6YwqyOlk4WcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6YwqyOlk4WcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6YwqyOlk4WcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6YwqyOlk4WcC&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Objective_Genetics_Biotechnology_Biochem.html?hl=&id=6YwqyOlk4WcC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6YwqyOlk4WcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "G16vBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "wCVZyW5UOF0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/G16vBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Bioreaction Engineering Principles", "subtitle": "Second Edition", "authors": ["Jens Nielsen", "John Villadsen", "Gunnar Lid\u00e9n"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "This is the second edition of the text \"Bioreaction Engineering Principles\" by Jens Nielsen and John Villadsen, originally published in 1994 by Plenum Press (now part of Kluwer).

A text on bioreactions written in the early 1990's will not reflect the enormous development of experimental as well as theoretical aspects of cellular reactions during the past decade. In the preface to the first edition we admitted to be newcomers in the field. One of us (JV) has had 10 more years of job training in biotechnology, and the younger author (IN) has now received international recognition for his work with the hottest topics of \"modem\" biotechnology. Furthermore we are happy to have induced Gunnar Liden, professor of chemical reaction engineering at our sister university in Lund, Sweden to join us as co-author of the second edition. His contribution, especially on the chemical engineering aspects of \"real\" bioreactors has been of the greatest value. Chapter 8 of the present edition is largely unchanged from the first edition.

The JAK (Janus Kinase) Protein tyrosine kinases are novel phosphotransferases absolutely required for cellular signalling downstream of non-catalytic cytokine receptors (amongst others). These molecules are components in pathways utilising the STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) transcription factors.

At this meeting the recent developments in the field of tryptophan research were presented by leading researchers from all over the world in 81 oral and 48 poster contri butions. Research on tryptophan and its derivatives provides an inexhaustible subject. At the conference we tried to compose a multifacetted picture of the recent investiga tions through contributions from the major disciplines involved. Thus, we tried to strike a balance between basic research topics and clinical, nutritional or industrial applica tions. We offered workshops on tryptophan (in sleep and mood), melatonjn, IDO-acti vation and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) as a platform for intensive discussion for the participants. In these proceedings many contributions are multidisciplinary and have practical or theoretical implications for different research fields. Hence, we have organized this volume in nine main chapters according to basic disciplines and subjects.

Cell biological approaches, advanced genetics, biophysics and biochemistry have greatly contributed to an increase in our knowledge in this field.lt is obvious however, that the three major membrane constituents - lipids, proteins and carbohydrates- are studied, in most cases separately and that a coherent overview of the various aspects of membrane biogenesis is not readily available. The NATO Advanced Study Institute on \"New Perspectives in the Dynamics of Assembly of Biomembranes\" intended to provide such an overview: it was set up to teach students and specialists the achievements obtained in the various research areas and to try and integrate the numerous aspects of membrane assembly into a coherent framework. The articles in here reflect this. Statting with detailed contributions on phospholipid structure, dynamics, organization and biogenesis, an up to date overview of the basic, lipidic backbone of biomembranes is given. Extensive progress is made in the research on membrane protein biosynthesis. In particular the post- and co-translational modification processes of proteins, the mechanisms of protein translocation and the sorting mechanisms which are necessary to direct proteins to their final, intra - or extracellular destination have been characterized in detail. Modern genetic approaches were indispensable in this research area: gene cloning, hybrid protein construction, site directed mutagenesis and sequencing techniques elucidated many functional aspects of specific nucleic acid and amino acid sequences.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642731846"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642731848"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 477, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Membrane_Biogenesis-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Nl3mCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "9lXPYobZkxQC", "etag": "VMlt/XasHW0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9lXPYobZkxQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Innate Immunity of Plants, Animals and Humans", "authors": ["Holger Heine"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2007-12-07", "description": "This book has been cunningly designed to provide an overview of our current knowledge about the innate immune systems of these three types of organisms.

This period has been marked by a volume of new empirical data and advances in theoretical and analytical issues related to DNA. Comparative DNA sequencing, facilitated by the amplification of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has become the tool of choice for molecular systematics. As a result, large portions of the Molecular Systematics of Plants have become outdated. Molecular Systematics of Plants II summarizes these recent achievements in plant molecular systematics. Like its predecessor, this completely revised work illustrates the potential of DNA markers for addressing a wide variety of phylogenetic and evolutionary questions. The volume provides guidance in choosing appropriate techniques, as well as appropriate genes for sequencing, for given levels of systematic inquiry. More than a review of techniques and previous work, Molecular Systematics of Plants II provides a stimulus for developing future research in this rapidly evolving field. Molecular Systematics of Plants II is not only written for systematists (faculty, graduate students, and researchers), but also for evolutionary biologists, botanists, and paleobotanists interested in reviewing current theory and practice in plant molecular systematics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0412111217"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780412111211"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 574, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GHZ2OsKhXD4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GHZ2OsKhXD4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GHZ2OsKhXD4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=53&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GHZ2OsKhXD4C&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Molecular_Systematics_of_Plants_II.html?hl=&id=GHZ2OsKhXD4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Molecular_Systematics_of_Plants_II-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GHZ2OsKhXD4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GHZ2OsKhXD4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AFXaBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "KsJobKK5B1U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AFXaBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Human Apolipoprotein Mutants 2", "subtitle": "From Gene Structure to Phenotypic Expression", "authors": ["Cesare Sirtori"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "The pleasant community of Limone suI Garda provided outstanding hospitality for a second NATO ARW dealing with apolipoprotein variants, which are natures clues for the discovery of the physiological roles of apolipoproteins in lipoprotein metabolism in normal subjects and patients with specific dyslipoproteinemias. Limone, the site of discovery of the first human apolipoprotein mutant, apoA-I-Milano, provided a brilliant sunny spring venue for more than 50 participants from both sides of the ocean. The attendance at the colorful opening ceremony of the ARW was one of the largest on record. Two members of the Italian government, the Secretaries of Health and the Navy, gave the welcoming addresses. Six television networks, two with national audiences, covered the international workshop. The Limone oracles provided a montage of insights gleamed from the eyes of the clinican, the biochemist, and the molecular biologist. The cumulative information on the molecular defects in lipoprotein metabolism reviewed by this diverse group of investigators provided an ever expanding horizon of new knowledge in this fast moving and some times perplexing field. Clinical vignettes were presented on patients from throughout the world including Canada (Connelly), Turkey (Schmitz), and France (Infante) detailing the clinical sequelae of a defect in a specific apolipoprotein.

The motivation that drove us to organize this meeting was the feeling that distinct groups of researchers, active in key areas of modern immunology, sometimes fail to communicate with each other simply because of different traditional affiliations. Yet it is urgent that \"molecular\" and \"cellular\" people cooperate more if immunology is to continue the exportation of new concepts to other disciplines. In fact, the deep meaning of molecule-molecule and cell-cell interaction, the generation of signals and their effective transmission which results in elicitation, control or suppression of responses cannot be unraveled without the experts on antibody structure or complement activation sharing their views with the experts on T cell, B cell and macrophage membrane receptors as well as the experts on factors that carry the information released by these cells. Whether the meeting was scientifically fruitful, the reader can judge after having digested these pages. We, the organizers, are not sure whether the optimal amount\u00b7of interaction had taken place; especially considering how hard it is to overcome the scientist's catch 22: You have to know something quite well before you get really interested in it.

The wide array and incredible variety of environments found across the Arabian peninsula are truly dramatic; tro- cal coastal plains are found bordering up against barren sandy deserts, high mountain plateaus are deeply incised by ancient river courses. As the birthplace of Islam, the recent history of the region is well documented and thoroughly studied. However, legendary explorers such as T.E. Lawrence, Wilfred Thesiger, and St. John Philby discovered hints of a much deeper past during their travels across the subcontinent. Drawn to Arabia by the magnifcent solitude of its vast sand seas, these intrepid adventurers learned from the Bedouin how to penetrate its deserts and returned with stirring accounts of lost civilizations among the wind-swept dunes. We now know that, prior to recorded history, Arabia housed countless peoples living a variety of lifestyles, including some of the world\u2019s earliest pastoralists, c- munities of incipient farmers, fshermen dubbed the \u201cIchthyophagi\u201d by ancient Greek geographers, and Paleolithic big-game hunters who were among the frst humans to depart their ancestral homeland in Africa. In fact, some archaeological investigations indicate that Arabia was inhabited by early hominins extending far back into the Early Pleistocene, perhaps even into the Late Pliocene.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "904812719X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789048127191"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 312, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.6.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&rdid=book-x6o4XLIKN0UC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Evolution_of_Human_Populations_in_Ar-sample-epub.acsm?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Evolution_of_Human_Populations_in_Ar-sample-pdf.acsm?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=x6o4XLIKN0UC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CGjT1zxS9NQC", "etag": "gkWEpk5lcfg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CGjT1zxS9NQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Allosteric Regulatory Enzymes", "authors": ["Thomas W.

The confe rence was organised by the Institute of Anthropology of the Georg August-University in GCittingen. At first glance, it might be surprising that the organizers are anthropolo gists. But this is a result of change of paradigm prehistoric anthropology is facing at the time. For decades, population development and population processes in the past have been looked at in terms of morphology, thus describing the diversity of human populations by the outer appearance of the skeletal findings and by the reconstruction of population structures. The new approach concentrates less on how people in the past looked like, but moreover on what they did and how they lived. Thus, research is based on ecosystem-theories, and it aims on the evaluation of ancient ecological features and past man/environment relationships. Research is encouraged since anthropologists are asked a lot of questions by historians and social scientists, who became more and more interested in the history of every day's life. Prehistoric anthropology today focu ses also on manners, habits, ways of life and environmental constituents as they can be traced from skeletal remains, which represent an important historical source. The ecosystemic approach is promising since the experiences of daily life certainly influence human behaviour, life style and mentality, thus directing reproduction and therefore population development.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642732973"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642732976"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 174, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=63&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-R1zsCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Trace_Elements_in_Environmental_History-sample-pdf.acsm?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=R1zsCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "qds_AAAAQBAJ", "etag": "+GW0DCi2cJU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qds_AAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Molecular Biology of Neuropsychiatric Disorders", "authors": ["Dieter B.

Although nanoparticulate systems are of significant interest in various scientific and technological areas, there is little known about the safety of these nanoscale objects. It has now been established that the surfaces of nanoparticles are immediately covered by biomolecules (e.g. proteins, ions, and enzymes) upon their entrance into a biological medium. This interaction with the biological medium modulates the surface of the nanoparticles, conferring a \u201cbiological identity\u201d to their surfaces (referred to as a \u201ccorona\u201d), which determines the subsequent cellular/tissue responses. The new interface between the nanoparticles and the biological medium/proteins, called \u201cbio-nano interface,\u201d has been very rarely studied in detail to date, though the interest in this topic is rapidly growing. In this book, the importance of the physiochemical characteristics of nanoparticles for the properties of the protein corona is discussed in detail, followed by comprehensive descriptions of the methods for assessing the protein-nanoparticle interactions. The advantages and limitations of available corona evaluation methods (e.g. spectroscopy methods, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and differential centrifugal sedimentation) are examined in detail, followed by a discussion of the possibilities for enhancing the current methods and a call for new techniques. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of protein-nanoparticle interaction phenomena are explored and discussed, with a focus on the biological impacts.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642375552"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642375553"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 86, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=67&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10207, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-7blAAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10207000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Nanoparticle_Interactions-sample-epub.acsm?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Nanoparticle_Interactions-sample-pdf.acsm?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7blAAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Gv3JipuhSdMC", "etag": "0pLCngM3Q6Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Gv3JipuhSdMC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Echinodermata", "authors": ["Valeria Matranga"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2006-03-30", "description": "Members of the phylum Echinodermata are among the most familiar marine invertebrates.

With this book, the editors assert that the density functional (DF) method satisfies these goals and has come into its own as an advanced method of computational chemistry. The wealth of applications presented in the book, ranging from solid state sys tems and polymers to organic and organo-metallic molecules, metallic clus ters, and biological complexes, prove that DF is becoming a widely used computational tool in chemistry. Progress in the methodology and its imple mentation documented by the contributions in this book demonstrate that DF calculations are both accurate and efficient. In fact, the results of DF calculations may pleasantly surprise many chem ists. Even the simplest approximation of DF, the local spin density method (LSD), yields molecular structures typical of ab initio correlated methods. The next level of theory, the nonlocal spin density method, predicts the energies of molecular processes within a few kcallmol or less. Like the Hartree-Fock (HF) and configuration interaction (CI) methods, the DF method is based only on fundamental physical constants. Therefore, it does not require semiempirical parameters and can be applied to any molecular system and to metallic phases. However, DF's greatest advantage is that it can be applied to much larger systems than those approachable by tradition al ab initio methods, especially when compared with correlated ab initio methods.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461231363"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461231361"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 443, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7563.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-vBnSBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7563800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Density_Functional_Methods_in_Chemistry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vBnSBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EWULw650QA8C", "etag": "jdGaYXSC3i8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EWULw650QA8C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biosensors and Their Applications", "authors": ["Victor C.

Investi gators from diverse disciplines find themselves with the unanticipated task of identifying and analyzing a protein and studying its physical properties and biochemical interactions. In most cases, the ultimate goal remains understanding the role(s) that the target protein is playing in cellular physiology. It was my intention that this manual would make the initial steps in the discovery process less time consuming and less intimidating. This book is not meant to be read from cover to cover. The expanded Table of Contents and the index should help locate what you are seeking. My aim was to provide practically oriented information that will assist the experimentalist in benchtop problem solving. The appendices are filled with diverse information gleaned from catalogs, handbooks, and manuals that are presented in a distilled fashion designed to save trips to the library and calls to technical service representatives. The user is encouraged to expand on the tables and charts to fit individual experimental situations. This second edition pays homage to the computer explosion and the various genome projects that have revolutionized how benchtop scientific research is performed.

Efforts have been concentrated on the measurement of the expression of RNA transcripts. In an analogy to the genome, the term \"transcriptome\" was created to refer to the complete set of RNAs in a cell type or tissue in a particular situation. Transcriptomics is the science that studies this issue and it is a branch of functional genomics. Transcriptomics in Heath and Disease provides a comprehensive overview of the science of transcriptomics initially in health, focusing on the concept of the transcriptome and the main methods to evaluate it. The authors discuss the concept and use of gene expression signatures and transcriptional biomarkers in normal development and diseased tissues and organs. As the transcriptome changes depending on the pathology, there is also a focus on the variations in the gene expression in different diseases such as autoimmune, inflammation, cancer and infections. This book should be very useful for researchers in molecular biology focusing on gene expression, human genetics, immunology, and genomics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319119854"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319119850"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 344, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=91&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-u91sBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Transcriptomics_in_Health_and_Disease-sample-epub.acsm?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Transcriptomics_in_Health_and_Disease-sample-pdf.acsm?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=u91sBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VebcBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "uiroEKw8/OA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VebcBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Methods for Protein Analysis", "subtitle": "A Practical Guide for Laboratory Protocols", "authors": ["Robert A.

The last decade has seen a massive advance in understanding the molecular logic of chemosensory information processing, beyond that already achieved in the rst few years following Linda Bucks discovery of odorant receptors. Shortly afterwards, the major principles of olfactory representation had been established in mammals as the one neuron/ one receptor rule and the convergence of neurons, which express the same receptor, onto individual modules in the olfactory bulb. In recent years, such studies have been extended to lower vertebrates, including shes and other phyla, i. e. , arthropods, worms, and insects, showing both the general validity of these concepts and some exceptions to the rule. In parallel, hallmarks of the molecular logic of taste sensation have been deciphered and found to differ in interesting ways from those of smell sensation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540699198"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540699194"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 262, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 18526, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 18526, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&rdid=book-EnmrDv1cMVkC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18526000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 18526000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chemosensory_Systems_in_Mammals_Fishes_a-sample-epub.acsm?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chemosensory_Systems_in_Mammals_Fishes_a-sample-pdf.acsm?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EnmrDv1cMVkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FDz2DQAAQBAJ", "etag": "YP1LCF17j+8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FDz2DQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "From Matter to Life", "subtitle": "Information and Causality", "authors": ["Sara Imari Walker", "Paul C.

Dyslipidemia, are disorders of the metabolism of soluble transporters of lipids in extracellular spaces of the human body (including blood), called lipoproteins. They are major cardiovascular risk factors, causally related with atherosclerosis and are themselves multifactorial diseases, resulting from interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The study of genetic factors has recently taken a new path with the study of DNA as an experimental object. More than fifty genes of lipoprotein metabolism have been identified in both their physiological actions and their contribution to the pathogenesis of human dyslipidemia. The diversity of observations has refined our current knowledge of the control of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in living organisms beyond the limits of the cardiovascular system (e.g., brain, immune system, and development).

Neurological and cardiovascular abnormalities occur in patients with severe genetic hyperhomocysteinemia and lead to premature death due to vascular complications. Although it is considered a non-protein amino acid, studies over the past dozen years have discovered mechanisms by which homocysteine becomes a component of proteins. Homocysteine-containing proteins lose their normal biological function and become auto-immunogenic and pro-thrombotic. In this book, the author, a pioneer and a leading contributor to the field, describes up-to date studies of the biological chemistry of homocysteine-containing proteins, as well as pathological consequences and clinical implications of their formation. This is a comprehensive account of the broad range of basic science and medical implications of homocysteine-containing proteins for health and disease. \u200b", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783709114100"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3709114101"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 166, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=104&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&rdid=book-iqTgV_Imw0UC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Homocysteine_in_Protein_Structure_Functi-sample-epub.acsm?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Homocysteine_in_Protein_Structure_Functi-sample-pdf.acsm?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iqTgV_Imw0UC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Y0YyBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "5oLlfI8jR9o", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y0YyBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Confocal Microscopy for Biologists", "authors": ["Alan R.

Confocal microscopy has now become an important research tool, with a large number of new fluorescent dyes becoming available in the past few years, for probing your pet structure or molecule within fixed or living cell or tissue sampies. Many of the people interested in using confocal microscopy to further their research do not have a background in microscopy or even cell biology and so not only do they find considerable difficulty in obtaining satisfactory results with a confocal microscope, but they may be mislead by how data is being presented. This book is intended to teach you the basic concepts ofmicroscopy, fluorescence, digital imaging and the principles of confocal microscopy so that you may take full advantage ofthe excellent confocal microscopes now available. This book is also an excellent reference source for information related to confocal microscopy for both beginners and the more advanced users. For example, do you need to know the optimal pinhole size for a 63x 1. 4 NA lens? Do you need to know the fluorescence emission spectrum of Alexa 568? Access to the wealth of practical information in this book is made easier by using both the detailed index and the extensive glossary.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306485657"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306485656"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 467, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Confocal_Microscopy_for_Biologists-sample-epub.acsm?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Confocal_Microscopy_for_Biologists-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Y0YyBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "HnnrBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "SqgjBNzfpyM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HnnrBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Acetogenesis", "authors": ["Harold L.

VII. Histochemistry and cytochemistry are essential tools in biomedical research and routine service laboratories. Most texts on histochemistry fall into one of two categories: 1. Encyclopaedic texts covering all or nearly all information available on the whole or selected parts of histochemistry. 2. Reviews or surveys of methods found to be useful by the author(s). While the former category often appeals to the more philosophically inclined reader, direct guidance on the selection of technique may be difficult to find. In contrast, the latter category are often excellent sources for details on how to perform a particular method with a reasonable chance of success. Consideration of the exact mechanism of staining, of possible reasons for failure, and of alternative techniques are, however, frequently lacking. This book is an introduction to the scientific basis of histochemistry and is intended to provide a background for the selection and development of appro priate methods. It is not a \"cook book\" and readers expecting exhaustive methodological descriptions will be disappointed. Although most ofthe contributors to this book would not describe themselves as histochemists, they have all at some time found it essential to develop a basic understanding of histochemistry.

It continues with a second important focus, agroforestry, and describes the use and promise of both legume trees with their rhizobial symbionts and other nitrogen-fixing trees with their actinorhizal colonization. An over-arching theme of all chapters is the interaction of the plants and trees with microbes and this theme allows other aspects of soil microbiology, such as interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the impact of soil-stress factors on biological nitrogen fixation, to be addressed. Furthermore, a link to basic science occurs through the inclusion of chapters describing the biogeochemically important nitrogen cycle and its key relationships among nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification.

In Pesticide Protocols, expert researchers-who have each perfected the techniques they write about-describe in step-by-step detail robust methods for the detection of pesticide compounds or their metabolites, techniques that are highly useful in food, environmental, and biological monitoring, and in studies of exposure via food, water, air, and the skin or lungs. The methods range from gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection and other classic detectors, to capillary electrophoresis and immunochemical or radioimmunoassay techniques. The authors apply these broad-ranging techniques to the analysis of several families of pesticides, to pesticide residues in vegetables, to pesticides in water and air, and to pesticide exposure. The authors have focused on extraction and cleanup procedures in order to develop and optimize more fully automated and miniaturized methods, including solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and on-line tandem liquid chromatography trace enrichment, among others. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Biotechnology series format, each offering step-by-step laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principles behind the technique, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Comprehensive and versatile, Pesticide Protocols offers analysts powerful and highly practical tools for analyzing the presence of pesticides in complex matrices.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781592599295"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "159259929X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 503, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dF7EsvdaTbgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dF7EsvdaTbgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dF7EsvdaTbgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=111&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dF7EsvdaTbgC&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Pesticide_Protocols.html?hl=&id=dF7EsvdaTbgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Pesticide_Protocols-sample-epub.acsm?id=dF7EsvdaTbgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Pesticide_Protocols-sample-pdf.acsm?id=dF7EsvdaTbgC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dF7EsvdaTbgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "P2FqCQAAQBAJ", "etag": "hLaZS2u7S8E", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/P2FqCQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Metal-Oxo and Metal-Peroxo Species in Catalytic Oxidations", "authors": ["B.

Although the primary photochemical reactions of photosynthesis are highly efficient, a small fraction of absorbed photons escapes as Chl fluorescence, and this fraction varies with metabolic state, providing a basis for monitoring quantitatively various processes of photosynthesis. The book explains the mechanisms with which plants defend themselves against environmental stresses (excessive light, extreme temperatures, drought, hyper-osmolarity, heavy metals and UV).

Evans"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-11-11", "description": "By a happy coincidence, the completion of this text coincided with the 200th anniversary of the discovery of gadolinite, the mineral with which the lanthanide story begins. For a group of elements which occur in only trace amounts biologically, and which have no known metabolic role, the lanthanides have spawned a surprisingly large biochemicalliterature. Se rious interest in the biochemical properties ofthese elements can be traced to concerns about the safety of radioactive lanthanides toward the end of World War 11. As recent events at Chernobyl indicate, this concern re mains topical. However, the literature on lanthanide biochemistry pre dates the atomic era, beginning with sporadic, medically motivated studies in the latter part of the 19th century. Much of the present biochemical activity involving the lanthanides centers around their ability to provide 2 important information on the interactions of Ca + with macromolecules and with eukafyotic cells. With the increasing industrial use of the lan thanides, their toxicological properties will need to be examined more closely. Rare earth pneumonoconiosis has already been identified as a disease produced by industrial exposure to lanthanides. Several of the biochemical properties of the lanthanides are of relevance to modern medicine. Already cerium-based ointments are used to treat burn wounds, while paramagnetic lanthanides find application in nuclear magnetic res onance imaging. This book is an attempt to collate and to present in reasonable detail existing knowledge of lanthanide biochemistry before the literature be comes unmanageable.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468487480"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468487485"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 444, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Biochemistry_of_the_Lanthanides-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Jj6eBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xmn7CAAAQBAJ", "etag": "qoHP3W3aj6Y", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xmn7CAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Plant Proteins from European Crops", "subtitle": "Food and Non-Food Applications", "authors": ["Jacques Gueguen", "Yves Popineau"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "Jointly published with INRA, Paris Plant proteins are regarded as versatile, functional ingredients or as active biological compounds, and as essential nutrients in food. Besides food uses, plant proteins are also considered as \"green\" chemical molecules useful in manufacturing non-food industrial products. This new utilization of plant proteins presents a great challenge for agriculture and industry and will also be beneficial for the environment. In this book, numerous scientists working on all aspects of proteins from the major European crops report on the role played by plant proteins in food systems and their effects on human health. In addition, the most recent data on protein-based plastic materials and other non-food products are presented.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783662037201"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3662037203"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 339, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:BioChemistry&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 14278, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 14278, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-xmn7CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 14278000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 14278000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Plant_Proteins_from_European_Crops-sample-pdf.acsm?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xmn7CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
