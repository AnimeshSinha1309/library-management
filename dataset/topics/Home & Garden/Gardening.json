intensive food production in small spaces There are 40 million acres of lawns in North America. In their current form, these unproductive expanses of grass represent a significant financial and environmental cost. However, viewed through a different lens, they can also be seen as a tremendous source of opportunity. Access to land is a major barrier for many people who want to enter the agricultural sector, and urban and suburban yards have huge potential for would-be farmers wanting to become part of this growing movement. The Urban Farmer is a comprehensive, hands-on, practical manual to help you learn the techniques and business strategies you need to make a good living growing high-yield, high-value crops right in your own backyard (or someone else's). Major benefits include: Low capital investment and overhead costs Reduced need for expensive infrastructure Easy access to markets. Growing food in the city means that fresh crops may travel only a few blocks from field to table, making this innovative approach the next logical step in the local food movement. Based on a scalable, easily reproduced business model, The Urban Farmer is your complete guide to minimizing risk and maximizing profit by using intensive production in small leased or borrowed spaces.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781550926019"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1550926012"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2192, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2192, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-PAQkCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2192000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2192000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Urban_Farmer-sample-epub.acsm?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Urban_Farmer-sample-pdf.acsm?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=PAQkCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "4FAyxoRJVJEC", "etag": "Xb+r1OO+mgw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/4FAyxoRJVJEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Green Desire", "subtitle": "Imagining Early Modern English Gardens", "authors": ["Rebecca W. Bushnell"], "publisher": "Cornell University Press", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "For Rebecca Bushnell, English gardening books tell a fascinating tale of the human love for plants and our will to make them do as we wish. These books powerfully evoke the desires of gardeners: they show us gardeners who, like poets, imagine not just what is but what should be. In particular, the earliest English garden books, such as Thomas Hill's The Gardener's Labyrinth or Hugh Platt's Floraes Paradise, mix magical practices with mundane recipes even when the authors insist that they rely completely on their own experience in these matters. Like early modern \"books of secrets,\" early gardening manuals often promise the reader power to alter the essential properties of plants: to make the gillyflower double, to change the lily's hue, or to grow a cherry without a stone. Green Desire describes the innovative design of the old manuals, examining how writers and printers marketed them as fiction as well as practical advice for aspiring gardeners. Along with this attention to the delights of reading, it analyzes the strange dignity and pleasure of garden labor and the division of men's and women's roles in creating garden art. The book ends by recounting the heated debate over how much people could do to create marvels in their own gardens. For writers and readers alike, these green desires inspired dreams of power and self-improvement, fantasies of beauty achieved without work, and hopes for order in an unpredictable world--not so different from the dreams of gardeners today.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0801441439"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780801441431"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 198, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Green_Desire.html?hl=&id=4FAyxoRJVJEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4FAyxoRJVJEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "z_mODwAAQBAJ", "etag": "aNHL19r9ztE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/z_mODwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The World of Ficus Bonsai", "authors": ["Jerry Meislik"], "publisher": "FriesenPress", "publishedDate": "2019-02-22", "description": "Jerry Meislik is a well-known bonsai lecturer, demonstrator, teacher and writer.

This new book is written for the everyday bonsai grower who wishes help in growing, styling and making the best fig bonsai possible from a tree or two and also contains information about figs suitable for the advanced bonsai grower and artist. The book is highly enhanced from the first book as it now contains over 40 Ficus species references that will greatly help the bonsai enthusiast to identify and to grow these specimens. Also included are photos of many Ficus species to aid in identifying the often confusing world of Ficus. There is also a list of Ficus that likely will prove difficult to grow as bonsai.

Ironically, this does such a good job aerating that gardeners spend the rest of the season pulling weeds and replacing the suddenly energized (and easily used up) nutrients. Mother nature, on the other hand, gardens from the top down-layering undisturbed soil with leaves and other organic materials. In following this example and synthesizing the work of other perceptive gardeners, Lee Reich presents a compelling new system called weedless gardening. The Weedless Garden is good for plants and it's good for people. It protects the soil, contributes to plant health, reduces water needs, cuts down on a gardener's labor, encourages earthworms and, of course, mitigates weed problems by keeping the seeds dormant. Four basic tenets form the system's backbone-minimize soil disruption; protect soil surface; avoid soil compaction; use drip irrigation-and the way to get there is simple. For a new bed or established garden, layering is key, and the perfect material to use is also among the most common-newspaper. Add organic mulch and compost on top, and plants are growing in rich, self-generating humus. From vegetable gardening to flower gardens to planting trees, shrubs, and vines, The Weedless Garden works everywhere-allowing the gardener to work quite a bit less.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780761172024"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0761172025"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "3.6.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=21&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 900.28, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 450.14, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3MXMCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 900280000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 450140000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Weedless_Gardening-sample-epub.acsm?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Weedless_Gardening-sample-pdf.acsm?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3MXMCQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VT6r46c89mkC", "etag": "dButDu1iza4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VT6r46c89mkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Gardening Indoors", "subtitle": "The Indoor Gardener's Bible", "authors": ["George F.

But in this groundbreaking new book, Eric Toensmeier argues that agriculture\u2014specifically, the subset of practices known as \u201ccarbon farming\u201d\u2014can, and should be, a linchpin of a global climate solutions platform. Carbon farming is a suite of agricultural practices and crops that sequester carbon in the soil and in aboveground biomass. Combined with a massive reduction in fossil fuel emissions\u2014and in concert with adaptation strategies to our changing environment\u2014 carbon farming has the potential to bring us back from the brink of disaster and return our atmosphere to the \u201cmagic number\u201d of 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide. Toensmeier\u2019s book is the first to bring together these powerful strategies in one place, including in-depth analysis of the available research and, where research is lacking, a discussion of what it will take to get us there. Carbon farming can take many forms. The simplest practices involve modifications to annual crop production. Although many of these modifications have relatively low sequestration potential, they are widely applicable and easily adopted, and thus have excellent potential to mitigate climate change if practiced on a global scale. Likewise, grazing systems such as silvopasture are easily replicable, don\u2019t require significant changes to human diet, and\u2014given the amount of agricultural land worldwide that is devoted to pasture\u2014can be important strategies in the carbon farming arsenal. But by far, agroforestry practices and perennial crops present the best opportunities for sequestration. While many of these systems are challenging to establish and manage, and would require us to change our diets to new and largely unfamiliar perennial crops, they also offer huge potential that has been almost entirely ignored by climate crusaders. Many of these carbon farming practices are already implemented globally on a scale of millions of hectares. These are not minor or marginal efforts, but win-win solutions that provide food, fodder, and feedstocks while fostering community self-reliance, creating jobs, protecting biodiversity, and repairing degraded land\u2014all while sequestering carbon, reducing emissions, and ultimately contributing to a climate that will remain amenable to human civilization. Just as importantly to a livable future, these crops and practices can contribute to broader social goals such as women\u2019s empowerment, food sovereignty, and climate justice. The Carbon Farming Solution does not present a prescription for how cropland should be used and is not, first and foremost, a how-to manual, although following up on references in a given section will frequently provide such information. Instead, The Carbon Farming Solution is\u2014at its root\u2014a toolkit. It is the most complete collection of climate-friendly crops and practices currently available. With this toolkit, farmers, communities, and governments large and small, can successfully launch carbon farming projects with the most appropriate crops and practices to their climate, locale, and socioeconomic needs. Toensmeier\u2019s ultimate goal is to place carbon farming firmly in the center of the climate solutions platform, alongside clean solar and wind energy. With The Carbon Farming Solution, Toensmeier wants to change the discussion, impact policy decisions, and steer mitigation funds to the research, projects, and people around the world who envision a future where agriculture becomes the protagonist in this fraught, urgent, and unprecedented drama of our time. Citizens, farmers, and funders will be inspired to use the tools presented in this important new book to transform degraded lands around the world into productive carbon-storing landscapes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603585729"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603585729"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 512, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4835.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4835.08, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-izTYCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4835080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4835080000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Carbon_Farming_Solution-sample-epub.acsm?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Carbon_Farming_Solution-sample-pdf.acsm?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=izTYCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "98CbDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "LLvrRo73IOA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/98CbDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Uncultivated", "subtitle": "Wild Apples, Real Cider, and the Complicated Art of Making a Living", "authors": ["Andy Brennan"], "publisher": "Chelsea Green Publishing", "publishedDate": "2019-06-17", "description": "Today, food is being reconsidered. It\u2019s a front-and-center topic in everything from politics to art, from science to economics. We know now that leaving food to government and industry specialists was one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest mistakes. The question is where do we go from here. Author Andy Brennan describes uncultivation as a process: It involves exploring the wild; recognizing that much of nature is omitted from our conventional ways of seeing and doing things (our cultivations); and realizing the advantages to embracing what we\u2019ve somehow forgotten or ignored. For most of us this process can be difficult, like swimming against the strong current of our modern culture. The hero of this book is the wild apple. Uncultivated follows Brennan\u2019s twenty-four-year history with naturalized trees and shows how they have guided him toward successes in agriculture, in the art of cider making, and in creating a small-farm business. The book contains useful information relevant to those particular fields, but is designed to connect the wild to a far greater audience, skillfully blending cultural criticism with a food activist\u2019s agenda. Apples rank among the most manipulated crops in the world, because not only do farmers want perfect fruit, they also assume the health of the tree depends on human intervention. Yet wild trees live all around us, and left to their own devices, they achieve different forms of success that modernity fails to apprehend. Andy Brennan learned of the health and taste advantages of such trees, and by emulating nature in his orchard (and in his cider) he has also enjoyed environmental and financial benefits. None of this would be possible by following today\u2019s prevailing winds of apple cultivation. In all fields, our cultural perspective is limited by a parallel proclivity. It\u2019s not just agriculture: we all must fight tendencies toward specialization, efficiency, linear thought, and predetermined growth. We have cultivated those tendencies at the exclusion of nature\u2019s full range. If Uncultivated is about faith in nature, and the power it has to deliver us from our own mistakes, then wild apple trees have already shown us the way.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603588454"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603588450"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Cooking"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1862.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 1862.16, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-98CbDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1862160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1862160000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Uncultivated-sample-epub.acsm?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=98CbDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "JrHHWcKowNkC", "etag": "dsJrXmtJcfA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JrHHWcKowNkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Landscape Estimating and Contract Administration", "authors": ["Stephen Angley", "Edward Horsey", "David Roberts"], "publisher": "Cengage Learning", "publishedDate": "2002", "description": "\"Landscape Estimating and Contract Administration\" can be used for students at technical schools and colleges who are studying landscape design, installation and maintenance.

Trade, travel and tourism are rapidly globalized, and border controls are reduced. This affects natural ecosystems in which aggressive invaders may have disastrous effects. `New' diseases affect human, animal and crop health. The Convention on Biological Diversity presents national authorities with a tall order in coping with this problem. For the first time in one volume, this book presents both ecological, biological and epidemiological aspects of invasive species, as well as the problem of disease organisms for agriculture and human health.

Addressing one of the most repressed subjects in landscape architecture, this book could only have been written by someone who is both an experienced gardener and a landscape architect. With Overgrown, Julian Raxworthy offers a watershed work in the tradition of Ian McHarg, Anne Whiston Spirn, Kevin Lynch, and J. B. Jackson. As a discipline, landscape architecture has distanced itself from gardening, and landscape architects take pains to distinguish themselves from gardeners or landscapers. Landscape architects tend to imagine gardens from the office, representing plants with drawings or other simulations, whereas gardeners work in the dirt, in real time, planting, pruning, and maintaining. In Overgrown, Raxworthy calls for the integration of landscape architecture and gardening. Each has something to offer the other: Landscape architecture can design beautiful spaces, and gardening can enhance and deepen the beauty of garden environments over time. Growth, says Raxworthy, is the medium of garden development; landscape architects should leave the office and go into the garden in order to know growth in an organic, nonsimulated way. Raxworthy proposes a new practice for working with plant material that he terms \u201cthe viridic\u201d (after \u201cthe tectonic\u201d in architecture), from the Latin word for green, with its associations of spring and growth. He builds his argument for the viridic through six generously illustrated case studies of gardens that range from \u201cformal\u201d to \u201cinformal\u201d approaches\u2014from a sixteenth-century French Renaissance water garden to a Scottish poet-scientist's \u201cmarginal\u201d garden, barely differentiated from nature. Raxworthy argues that landscape architectural practice itself needs to be \u201cgardened,\u201d brought back into the field. He offers a \u201cManifesto for the Viridic\u201d that casts designers and plants as vegetal partners in a renewed practice of landscape gardening.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780262038539"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0262038536"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 392, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Architecture"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6o2NDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6o2NDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6o2NDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6o2NDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Overgrown.html?hl=&id=6o2NDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6o2NDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "aAn2XI29yToC", "etag": "x4/qlaZFcpk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/aAn2XI29yToC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Winter Harvest Handbook", "subtitle": "Year Round Vegetable Production Using Deep-Organic Techniques and Unheated Greenhouses", "authors": ["Eliot Coleman"], "publisher": "Chelsea Green Publishing", "publishedDate": "2009-04-15", "description": "Choosing locally grown organic food is a sustainable living trend that\u2019s taken hold throughout North America. Celebrated farming expert Eliot Coleman helped start this movement with The New Organic Grower published 20 years ago. He continues to lead the way, pushing the limits of the harvest season while working his world-renowned organic farm in Harborside, Maine. Now, with his long-awaited new book, The Winter Harvest Handbook, anyone can have access to his hard-won experience. Gardeners and farmers can use the innovative, highly successful methods Coleman describes in this comprehensive handbook to raise crops throughout the coldest of winters. Building on the techniques that hundreds of thousands of farmers and gardeners adopted from The New Organic Grower and Four-Season Harvest, this new book focuses on growing produce of unparalleled freshness and quality in customized unheated or, in some cases, minimally heated, movable plastic greenhouses. Coleman offers clear, concise details on greenhouse construction and maintenance, planting schedules, crop management, harvesting practices, and even marketing methods in this complete, meticulous, and illustrated guide. Readers have access to all the techniques that have proven to produce higher-quality crops on Coleman\u2019s own farm. His painstaking research and experimentation with more than 30 different crops will be valuable to small farmers, homesteaders, and experienced home gardeners who seek to expand their production seasons. A passionate advocate for the revival of small-scale sustainable farming, Coleman provides a practical model for supplying fresh, locally grown produce during the winter season, even in climates where conventional wisdom says it \u201cjust can\u2019t be done.\u201d", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603582100"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "160358210X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 264, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.4.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aAn2XI29yToC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aAn2XI29yToC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aAn2XI29yToC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAn2XI29yToC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAn2XI29yToC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2096.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2096.07, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAn2XI29yToC&rdid=book-aAn2XI29yToC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2096070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2096070000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Winter_Harvest_Handbook-sample-epub.acsm?id=aAn2XI29yToC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Winter_Harvest_Handbook-sample-pdf.acsm?id=aAn2XI29yToC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aAn2XI29yToC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "P2GS1m876L4C", "etag": "O9JEoFVUMdc", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/P2GS1m876L4C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Flower Confidential", "subtitle": "The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful", "authors": ["Amy Stewart"], "publisher": "Algonquin Books", "publishedDate": "2008-03-18", "description": "Award-winning author Amy Stewart takes readers on an around-the-world, behind-the-scenes look at the flower industry and how it has sought\u2014for better or worse\u2014to achieve perfection.

More than just a field guide to wild edibles, it is a global plan for human survival. When Katrina Blair was eleven she had a life-changing experience where wild plants spoke to her, beckoning her to become a champion of their cause. Since then she has spent months on end taking walkabouts in the wild, eating nothing but what she forages, and has become a wild-foods advocate, community activist, gardener, and chef, teaching and presenting internationally about foraging and the healthful lifestyle it promotes. Katrina Blair\u2019s philosophy in The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is sobering, realistic, and ultimately optimistic. If we can open our eyes to see the wisdom found in these weeds right under our noses, instead of trying to eradicate an \u201cinvasive,\u201d we will achieve true food security. The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is about healing ourselves both in body and in spirit, in an age where technology, commodity agriculture, and processed foods dictate the terms of our intelligence. But if we can become familiar with these thirteen edible survival weeds found all over the world, we will never go hungry, and we will become closer to our own wild human instincts\u2014all the while enjoying the freshest, wildest, and most nutritious food there is. For free! The thirteen plants found growing in every region across the world are: dandelion, mallow, purslane, plantain, thistle, amaranth, dock, mustard, grass, chickweed, clover, lambsquarter, and knotweed. These special plants contribute to the regeneration of the earth while supporting the survival of our human species; they grow everywhere where human civilization exists, from the hottest deserts to the Arctic Circle, following the path of human disturbance. Indeed, the more humans disturb the earth and put our food supply at risk, the more these thirteen plants proliferate. It\u2019s a survival plan for the ages. Including over one hundred unique recipes, Katrina Blair\u2019s book teaches us how to prepare these wild plants from root to seed in soups, salads, slaws, crackers, pestos, seed breads, and seed butters; cereals, green powders, sauerkrauts, smoothies, and milks; first-aid concoctions such as tinctures, teas, salves, and soothers; self-care/beauty products including shampoo, mouthwash, toothpaste (and brush), face masks; and a lot more.

Charlotte Mendelson is perhaps unusually passionate about it. For despite her superficially normal existence, despite the fact that she has only six square metres of grotty urban soil and a few pots, she has a secret life. She is an extreme gardener, an obsessive, an addict. And like all addicts, she wants to spread the joy. Her garden may look like a nasty drunk old man's mini-allotment, chaotic, virtually flowerless, with weird recycling and nowhere to sit. When honoured friends are shown it, they tend to laugh. However, it is actually a tiny jungle, a minuscule farm, a wildly uneconomical experiment in intensive edible cultivation, on which she grows a taste of perhaps a hundred kinds of delicious fruits and odd vegetables. It is a source of infinite happiness and deep peace. It looks completely bonkers.

In this one-volume edition, modern readers are introduced to one of the best nature writers of the last century. As we read Peattie's eloquent and entertaining accounts of American trees, we catch glimpses of our country's history and past daily life that no textbook could ever illuminate so vividly. Here you'll learn about everything from how a species was discovered to the part it played in our country\u2019s history. Pioneers often stabled an animal in the hollow heart of an old sycamore, and the whole family might live there until they could build a log cabin. The tuliptree, the tallest native hardwood, is easier to work than most softwood trees; Daniel Boone carved a sixty-foot canoe from one tree to carry his family from Kentucky into Spanish territory. In the days before the Revolution, the British and the colonists waged an undeclared war over New England's white pines, which made the best tall masts for fighting ships. It's fascinating to learn about the commercial uses of various woods -- for paper, fine furniture, fence posts, matchsticks, house framing, airplane wings, and dozens of other preplastic uses. But we cannot read this book without the occasional lump in our throats. The American elm was still alive when Peattie wrote, but as we read his account today we can see what caused its demise. Audubon's portrait of a pair of loving passenger pigeons in an American beech is considered by many to be his greatest painting. It certainly touched the poet in Donald Culross Peattie as he depicted the extinction of the passenger pigeon when the beech forest was destroyed. A Natural History of North American Trees gives us a picture of life in America from its earliest days to the middle of the last century. The information is always interesting, though often heartbreaking. While Peattie looks for the better side of man's nature, he reports sorrowfully on the greed and waste that have doomed so much of America's virgin forest.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781595341679"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1595341676"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 512, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=59&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1008.9, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 504.45, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-t0fpCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1008900000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 504450000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Natural_History_of_North_American_Tree-sample-epub.acsm?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/A_Natural_History_of_North_American_Tree-sample-pdf.acsm?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DB8dCbmgQ74C", "etag": "7fnaF5YnMf4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DB8dCbmgQ74C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Pines of Silvicultural Importance", "publisher": "CABI", "publishedDate": "2002", "description": "Pines are the most economically important group of trees in the world, covering large parts of the Northern Hemisphere and also being of silvicultural significance in many countries in the Southern Hemisphere.

Through multi-functional and integrated farming systems, these tree crops can support environmental and social sustainability by providing food as well as promoting economic growth. Twenty years ago, little was known about the biology, ecology or the social impact of indigenous fruit tress on rural populations.

It is the story of a man travelling round France visiting a few selected French gardens on the way. Owners, intrigues, affairs, marriages, feuds, thwarted ambitions and desires, the largely unnamed ordinary gardeners, wars, plots and natural disasters run through every garden older than a generation or two and fill every corner of the grander historical ones. Families marry. Gardeners are poached. Political allegiances forged and shattered. The human trail crosses from garden to garden. They sit in their surrounding landscape, not as isolated islands but attached umbilically to it, sharing the geology, the weather, food, climate, local folklore, accent and cultural identity. Wines must be drunk and food tasted. Recipes found and compared. The perfect tarte-tartin pursued. None of these things can be ignored or separated from the shape and size of parterre, fountain, herbaceous border or pottager. So this is a book filled with stories and information, some of it about French gardens and gardening, but most of it about what makes France unlike anywhere else. From historical gardens like Versailles,Vaux le Vicomte and Courances to the kitchen gardens of the Michelin chef Alain Passard. There will be grand potagers like Villandry and La Prieure D'Orsan and allotments and back gardens spotted on the way. Monty also celebrates the obvious French associations of food and wine and finds gardens dedicated to vegetables, herbs and fruit.

Imagine how much more self-reliant our communities would be if 30 million acres of lawns were made productive again. Permaculture is a practical way to apply ecological design principles to food, housing, and energy systems; making growing fruits, vegetables and livestock easier and more sustainable. The Permaculture Handbook is a step-by-step, beautifully illustrated guide to creating resilient and prosperous households andneighborhoods, complemented by extensive case studies of three successful farmsteads and market gardens. This comprehensive manual casts garden farming as both an economic opportunity and a strategy for living well with less money. It shows how, by mimicking the intelligence of nature and applying appropriate technologies such as solar and environmental design, permaculture can: Create an abundance of fresh, nourishing local produce Reduce dependence on expensive, polluting fossil fuels Drought-proof our cities and countryside Convert waste into wealth Permaculture is about working with the earth and with each other to repair the damage of industrial overreach and to enrich the living world that sustains us. The Permaculture Handbook is the definitive, practical NorthAmerican guide to this revolutionary practice, and is a must-read for anyone concerned about creating food security, resilience and a legacy of abundance rather than depletion.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781550924855"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1550924850"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 2, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.4.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=76&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3289, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3289, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&rdid=book-M5fZAnAEH7MC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3289000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3289000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Permaculture_Handbook-sample-epub.acsm?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Permaculture_Handbook-sample-pdf.acsm?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=M5fZAnAEH7MC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "qr4sDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Ja5KeL5SASs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qr4sDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "War Gardens", "subtitle": "A Journey Through Conflict in Search of Calm", "authors": ["Lalage Snow"], "publisher": "Hachette UK", "publishedDate": "2018-09-06", "description": "'A remarkable book . . . It's a powerful testament to the healing balm of gardening and the resilience of the human spirit in the direst of circumstances.' Financial Times 'Not a happy book and yet it's magically heartening. It makes a gardener question his or her values.' The Times 'This extraordinary book...warm and engaging...like a photograph magicked to life.' Spectator 'Snow has spent ten years as a photographer and filmmaker covering unrest . . . Throughout that time she has sought comfort in green oases and come to understand \"how vital gardens are 'against a horrid wilderness' of war\". . . There can be few counter-narratives as enchanting and sad as those Snow recounts in War Gardens.' Times Literary Supplement 'For all these victims of war, their gardens are places in which to breathe, providing moments of calm, hope and optimism in a fragile life of horror and uncertainty. For many, it helps them to grieve. Books seldom bring a lump to my throat, but this one did.' Spectator 'What makes War Gardens the most illuminating garden book to be published this year, is the realisation that people's gardens are the antidotes to the horrors of their surroundings.' Country Life A journey through the most unlikely of gardens: the oases of peace people create in the midst of war In this millennium, we have become war weary. From Afghanistan to Iraq, from Ukraine to South Sudan and Syria, from Kashmir to the West Bank, conflict is as contagious and poisonous as Japanese knotweed. Living through it are people just like us with ordinary jobs, ordinary pressures and ordinary lives. Against a new landscape of horror and violence it is up to them to maintain a modicum of normality and colour. For some, gardening is the way to achieve this. Working in the world's most dangerous war zones, freelance war correspondent and photographer Lally Snow has often chanced across a very moving sight, a testimony to the triumph of the human spirit in adversity, a celebration of hope and beauty: a war garden. In Kabul, the royal gardens are tended by a centenarian gardener, though the king is long gone; in Camp Bastion, bored soldiers improvise tiny gardens to give themselves a moment's peace; on both sides of the dividing line in Jerusalem families tend groves of olives and raise beautiful plants from the unforgiving, disputed landscape; in Ukraine, families tend their gardens in the middle of a surreal, frozen war. War Gardens is a surprising, tragic and beautiful journey through the darkest places of the modern world, revealing the ways people make time and space for themselves and for nature even in the middle of destruction. Illustrated with Lally Snow's own award-winning photography, this is a book to treasure.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781787470705"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1787470709"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Travel"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.3.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 483.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 338.66, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qr4sDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 483800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 338660000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/War_Gardens-sample-epub.acsm?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qr4sDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KaRFRO68KLYC", "etag": "7iN7WwhmnTg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KaRFRO68KLYC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Trellises, Arbors & Pergolas", "subtitle": "Ideas and Plans for Garden Structures", "authors": ["Larry Johnston"], "publisher": "Meredith Books", "publishedDate": "2004", "description": "With advice on how to construct more than fifty garden structures, this guide to the architecture of gardening includes complete instructions for building a wide variety of arbors, trellises, fences, and other garden adornments.

In Rodale\u2019s Basic Organic Gardening, general garden-building skills (from \"Do I need to dig?\" to \"Where do I dig?\") and specific techniques (from \"How do I plant a seed?\" to \"How much should I water?\") are presented in growing-season order\u2014from garden planning and planting to growing and harvesting. Many other need-to-know topics like soil, compost, seeds, pest control, and weeds are explained in simple language to ensure success, even on a small scale, on the first try. More than 100 common garden terms are defined, and Smart Starts sidebars offer doable projects to build confidence and enthusiasm for expanding a garden when a gardener is ready. A flower, vegetable, and herb finder highlights easycare plants with good track records. Plus, there are no-dig garden methods, simple garden layouts, and tips and hints inspired by the most popular page views on OrganicGardening.com. With a \"no question is unwelcome\" approach, a troubleshooting section lessens frustrations and encourages experimentation.

Fay shows how to confidently meet, explore, and build relationships with key plant allies to enjoy a more balanced connection with yourself and your environment. Sharing her passion for the plant world, she provides a practical guide to rekindling your connection with nature, opening up to plant consciousness as a way to enrich your path and weave the enchantment of nature back into your own life. She includes more than 40 simple, practical exercises and meditations to guide you on a heart-centered journey of transformation and commune with the environment, the seasons, the cycles of the moon, and the Earth Heart.

southern United States. Out of print for several years, this newly revised and expanded edition now features descriptions of some 1,800 apple varieties that either originated in the South or were widely grown there before 1928. Author Lee Calhoun is one of the foremost figures in apple conservation in America. This masterwork reflects his knowledge and personal experience over more than thirty years, as he sought out and grew hundreds of classic apples, including both legendary varieties (like Nickajack and Magnum Bonum) and little-known ones (like Buff and Cullasaga). Representing our common orchard heritage, many of these apples are today at risk of disappearing from our national table. Illustrated with more than 120 color images of classic apples from the National Agricultural Library\u2019s collection of watercolor paintings, Old Southern Apples is a fascinating and beautiful reference and gift book. In addition to A-to-Z descriptions of apple varieties, both extant and extinct, Calhoun provides a brief history of apple culture in the South, and includes practical information on growing apples and on their traditional uses.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603583121"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603583122"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 5248.93, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 5248.93, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&rdid=book-XCFYuLbMuZQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5248930000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 5248930000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Old_Southern_Apples-sample-epub.acsm?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Old_Southern_Apples-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XCFYuLbMuZQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "jw_RAgAAQBAJ", "etag": "5X8mNCcz4sE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jw_RAgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Japanese Garden Design", "authors": ["Marc P.

The creation of a Japanese garden combines respect for nature with adherence to simple principles of aesthetics and structure. In Japanese Garden Design, landscape architect Marc Peter Keane presents the history and development of the classical metaphors that underlie all Japanese gardens. Keane describes the influences of Confucian, Shinto and Buddhist principles that have linked poetry and philosophy to the tangible metaphor of the garden in Japanese culture. Creative inspiration is found in the prehistoric origin of Japanese concepts of nature; the gardens of Heian aristocrats; the world-renowned Zen garden, or rock garden; the tea garden; courtyard garden; and stroll garden.

Motivated by a hunger for new flavors and working with thirty-six versatile wild plants--some increasingly found in farmers markets--she offers deliciously compelling recipes for everything from cocktails and snacks to appetizers, entr\u00e9es, and desserts, as well as bakes, breads, preserves, sauces, syrups, ferments, spices, and salts. From underexplored native flavors like bayberry and spicebush to accessible ecological threats like Japanese knotweed and mugwort, Viljoen presents hundreds of recipes unprecedented in scope. They range from simple quickweed griddle cakes with American burnweed butter to sophisticated dishes like a souffl\u00e9ed tomato roulade stuffed with garlic mustard, or scallops seared with sweet white clover, cattail pollen, and sweetfern butter. Viljoen makes unfamiliar ingredients familiar by treating each to a thorough culinary examination, allowing readers to grasp every plant's character and inflection. Forage, Harvest, Feast--featuring hundreds of color photographs as well as cultivation tips for plants easily grown at home--is destined to become a standard reference for any cook wanting to transform wildcrafted ingredients into exceptional dishes, spices, and drinks.

The biological world under our toes is often unexplored and unappreciated, yet it teems with life. In one square meter of earth, there lives trillions of bacteria, millions of nematodes, hundreds of thousands of mites, thousands of insects and worms, and hundreds of snails and slugs. But because of their location and size, many of these creatures are as unfamiliar and bizarre to us as anything found at the bottom of the ocean. Lavishly illustrated with nearly three hundred color illustrations and masterfully-rendered black and white drawings throughout, Life in the Soil invites naturalists and gardeners alike to dig in and discover the diverse community of creatures living in the dirt below us. Biologist and acclaimed natural history artist James B. Nardibegins with an introduction to soil ecosystems, revealing the unseen labors of underground organisms maintaining the rich fertility of the earth as they recycle nutrients between the living and mineral worlds. He then introduces readers to a dazzling array of creatures: wolf spiders with glowing red eyes, snails with 120 rows of teeth, and 10,000-year-old fungi, among others. Organized by taxon, Life in the Soil covers everything from slime molds and roundworms to woodlice and dung beetles, as well as vertebrates from salamanders to shrews. The book ultimately explores the crucial role of soil ecosystems in conserving the worlds above and below ground. A unique and illustrative introduction to the many unheralded creatures that inhabit our soils and shape our environment aboveground, Life in the Soil will inform and enrich the naturalist in all of us.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780226568539"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0226568539"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d0MXBkFY07UC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2201.92, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2201.92, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&rdid=book-d0MXBkFY07UC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2201920000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2201920000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Life_in_the_Soil-sample-epub.acsm?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Life_in_the_Soil-sample-pdf.acsm?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=d0MXBkFY07UC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "tVSsDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "8kROKN8HkmQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tVSsDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Farming on the Wild Side", "subtitle": "The Evolution of a Regenerative Organic Farm and Nursery", "authors": ["Nancy J.

In Farming on the Wild Side they explain the philosophical and scientific principles that influenced them as they phased out sheep and potatoes and embraced apples, pears, stone fruits, and a wide variety of uncommon berry crops; turned much of their property into a semi-wild state; and adapted their marketing and sales strategies to the new century. As the Haydens pursued their goals of enhancing biodiversity and regenerating their land, they incorporated agroforestry and permaculture principles into perennial fruit polycultures, a pollinator sanctuary, repurposed greenhouses for growing fruit, h\u00fcgelkultur, and ecological \u201cpest\u201d management. Beyond the practical techniques and tips, this book also inspires readers to develop greater ecological literacy and respect for the mysteries of the global ecosystem.

Participating in the grow-your-own movement is important to both reduce your food miles and control what makes it onto your family\u2019s table. If you\u2019ve hesitated to take part because installing and caring for a traditional vegetable garden doesn\u2019t seem to suit your life or your sense of style, Kitchen Garden Revival is here to show you there\u2019s a better, more beautiful way to grow food. Instead of row after row of cabbage and pepper plants plunked into a patch of dirt in the middle of the yard, kitchen gardens are attractive, highly tailored food gardens consisting of easy-to-maintain raised planting beds laid out in an organized geometric pattern. Offering both four seasons of ornamental interest and plenty of fresh, homegrown fruits, vegetables, and herbs, kitchen gardens are the way to grow your own food in a fashionable, modern, and practical way.

This unique book is truly a work of the heart. Hardly slick, not at all highbrow, Gardening Under the Arch is full of practical, homespun know-how based on the collective wisdom gleaned over years by determined gardeners in the chinook zone. There is knowledge here that can't be found in other books, and there is loads of passion for the love of gardening and all the special moments it brings.

From a cantankerous old pear tree to a strawberry that's too delicate to ship to distant markets, David Buchanan has grown out and evaluated thousands of varieties of fruits, grains, herbs, flowers, and vegetables, capturing not only their flavors, but their fascinating stories and their place in the local harvest. What we grow is just as important as where we grow it, and a resilient food system depends on the ongoing search for regionally adapted varieties. Local food at its best differs in both kind and quality from commodity crops that are shipped around the globe. If everyone were to grow the same apples or tomatoes, for example, then we would miss out on the full palate of tastes available to us, as well as the sense that local food can reflect a particular people, place, and culture. Profiling his own efforts as a young garden-farmer who is still finding his own place in the world (using leased gardens and orchard space), Buchanan also writes about some of the most important people who are working to defend and promote biodiversity and meaning in our food system. From gardeners and cooks to environmentalists and food activists - all of these people are preserving the best of our traditional foods and ensuring that they will be around for future generations to enjoy. Taste, Memory takes readers on a beautifully written personal journey into what food diversity really means, and why it matters now more than ever.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603584401"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603584404"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 224, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=103&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 1256.24, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 628.12, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC&rdid=book-eKpaN_eGTNUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 1256240000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 628120000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Taste_Memory-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eKpaN_eGTNUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "iLUaW0AIpmwC", "etag": "eaogJ4iqlXI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iLUaW0AIpmwC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Backyard Homestead", "subtitle": "Produce all the food you need on just a quarter acre!", "authors": ["Carleen Madigan"], "publisher": "Storey Publishing", "publishedDate": "2009-02-11", "description": "This comprehensive guide to homesteading provides all the information you need to grow and preserve a sustainable harvest of grains and vegetables; raise animals for meat, eggs, and dairy; and keep honey bees for your sweeter days.

low-tech, human-scale, biointensive farming methods Les Jardins de la Grelinette is a micro-farm located in Eastern Quebec, just north of the American border. Growing on just 1.5 acres, owners Jean-Martin and Maude-Helene feed more than 200 families through their thriving CSA and seasonal market stands and supply their signature mesclun salad mix to dozens of local establishments. The secret of their success is the low-tech, high-yield production methods they've developed by focusing on growing better rather than growing bigger, making their operation more lucrative and viable in the process. The Market Gardener is a compendium of La Grelinette's proven horticultural techniques and innovative growing methods. This complete guide is packed with practical information on: Setting-up a micro-farm by designing biologically intensive cropping systems, all with negligible capital outlay; Farming without a tractor and minimizing fossil fuel inputs through the use of the best hand tools, appropriate machinery and minimum tillage practices; Growing mixed vegetables systematically with attention to weed and pest management, crop yields, harvest periods and pricing approaches. Inspired by the French intensive tradition of maraichage and by iconic American vegetable grower Eliot Coleman, author and farmer Jean-Martin shows by example how to start a market garden and make it both very productive and profitable. Making a living wage farming without big capital outlay or acreages may be closer than you think.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781550925555"}, {"type": "ISBN_10",

of the English country house party by the bestselling historian. Croquet. Parlour games. Cocktails. Welcome to a glorious journey through the golden age of the country house party - and you are invited. Our host, celebrated historian Adrian Tinniswood, traces the evolution of this quintessentially British pastime from debauched royal tours to the flamboyant excess of the Bright Young Things. With cameos by the Jazz Age industrialist, the bibulous earl and the off-duty politician - whether in moated manor houses or ornate Palladian villas - Tinniswood gives a vivid insight into weekending etiquette and reveals the hidden lives of celebrity guests, from Nancy Astor to Winston Churchill, in all their drinking, feasting, gambling and fornicating. The result is a deliciously entertaining, star-studded, yet surprisingly moving portrait of a time when social conventions were being radically overhauled through the escapism of a generation haunted by war - and a uniquely fast-living period of English history. Praise for The Long Weekend: 'Delicious, occasionally fantastical, revealing in ways that Downton Abbey never was. It is as if Tinniswood is at the biggest, wildest, most luxuriantly decadent party ever thrown, and he knows everyone.' Observer 'A deliciously jaunty and wonderfully knowledgeable book. Tinniswood displays a terrific insider's grasp of gossip . A meticulous, irresistible story.' Spectator 'Elegant, encyclopedic and entertaining . A confident and skilled historian who understands the mores of his era and wears his learning lightly . Deserves to be on every costume drama producer's bookshelf.'

Over the past decade, landscape architects and garden designers have moved away from the more sedate shades commonly found in traditional gardens and have used plants and hardscape to experiment with explosions of color. From the layered and textural colors of Piet Oudolf to the high contrast colors of Tom Stuart Smith, this increased focus on color is a trademark of today\u2019s leading designers. Contemporary Color in the Landscape explores the whole spectrum of color: how we perceive and respond to color, how to design with color, how to manipulate contrast and create intensity with saturation, how to maximize impact by minimizing color, how to find your own personal color combinations, and how color is viewed in nature. In gorgeous, color-drenched photos Andrew Wilson showcases the work of leading garden designers as inspiring examples of the way color is used. Innovative gardens from all over the world help the reader visualize the core color lessons throughout the book. Supported by more than 300 stunning photographs, Contemporary Color in the Landscape integrates cutting-edge designers, their landscapes, color theory, new design ideas, and gorgeous photography into one inspirational, instructional, and must-have guide for design professionals.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781604693027"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1604693029"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 280, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=12OFIE1TciQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=12OFIE1TciQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=12OFIE1TciQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=12OFIE1TciQC&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Contemporary_Color_in_the_Landscape.html?hl=&id=12OFIE1TciQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Contemporary_Color_in_the_Landscape-sample-epub.acsm?id=12OFIE1TciQC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Contemporary_Color_in_the_Landscape-sample-pdf.acsm?id=12OFIE1TciQC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=12OFIE1TciQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "aTWCDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "MwlqA/CsEX0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/aTWCDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Holistic Home", "subtitle": "Feng Shui for Mind, Body, Spirit, Space", "authors": ["Laura Benko"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2016-01-19", "description": "Rule the world and take control of your emotional and mental health from where you sit, stand, and sleep.

The condition of the mind affects the psychology of how you dwell: subconscious influences, decorating with intention, and allowing your emotional issues and challenges to manifest in your space. The physical aspects of your design space, such as furniture positioning, design elements, sustainability, wellness, and organization, are representative of your relationship with your body. And finally, the spirit refers to all the invisible energies within you and your home\u2014feng shui, atmosphere, and the soul of your home. Years ago, author and holistic feng shui expert Laura Benko was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Around that time, a book serendipitously fell on her head. She took this as a much-needed sign to devote the next decade of her life to research and hundreds of transformative holistic design consultations.

Welch offer a personal, in-depth, and entertaining account of some of the great stories gathered during their years as participants in one of the most important plant-hunting efforts of the twentieth century\u2014the quest to save antique roses that disappeared from the market in a notoriously trend-driven business. By the 1950s, almost exclusively, modern roses (those with one compact bloom at the top of a large stem) were grown for the cut-flower market. The large rounded shrubs and billowy fence climbers known to our grandparents and great-grandparents in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had been reduced to this rather monotonous single style of plant. Yet those roses of old still grew, tough and persistent, in farmyards, cemeteries, vacant lots, and abandoned fields. The rediscovery of these antiques and the subsequent movement to conserve them became the mission of \u201crose rustlers,\u201d dedicated rosarians who studied, sought, cut, and cultivated these hardy survivors. Here, the authors chronicle their own origins, adventures, and discoveries as part of a group dubbed the Texas Rose Rustlers. They present tales of the many efforts that have helped restore lost roses not only to residential gardens, but also to commercial and church landscapes in Texas. Their experiences and friendships with other figures in the heirloom rose world bring an insider\u2019s perspective to the lore of \u201crustling,\u201d the art of propagation, and the continued fascination with the world\u2019s favorite flower.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781623495442"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "162349544X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 248, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Gardening"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.4.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BhRpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BhRpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BhRpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=116&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BhRpDwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rose_Rustlers.html?hl=&id=BhRpDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BhRpDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AO_pYOjrXDAC", "etag": "7WgezRKbwPs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AO_pYOjrXDAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cezanne's Garden", "authors": ["Derek Fell"], "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "The award-winning author of VAN GOGH'S GARDENS returns with a sumptuously illustrated book showcasing the garden and art of one of the most significant painters of the Impressionist Era.

Carving Out a Living on the Land tells the story of how Van Driesche navigated changing life circumstances, took advantage of unexpected opportunities, and leveraged new and old skills to piece together an economically viable living, while at the same time respecting the land\u2019s complex ecological relationships. From spoon carving to scything, coppicing to wreath-making, Carving Out a Living on the Land proves that you don\u2019t need acres of expensive bottomland to start your land-based venture, but rather the creativity and vision to see what might be done with that rocky section or ditch or patch of trees too small to log. You can lease instead of buy; build flexible, temporary structures rather than sink money into permanent ones; and take over an existing operation rather than start from scratch. What matters are your unique circumstances, talents, and interests, which when combined with what the land is capable of producing, can create a fulfilling and meaningful farming life.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603588270"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603588272"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Gardening&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2053.51, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2053.51, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-m6GcDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2053510000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2053510000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Carving_Out_a_Living_on_the_Land-sample-epub.acsm?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=m6GcDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
