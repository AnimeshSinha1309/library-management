Aim of this agent is to interact with the Dialogflow API and be able to at least do the following:

User inputs => "get me a book with this author and this title"
app is able to catch the author and title from the input
app is able to return the book
user is able to hear the answer

## Dev flow

### Entities

We create entities related to all the parameters we want to detect. The eentities can be create via a CSV/JSON file generated by a script or anything. Format of generated file: https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-export
In our case entities can be book titles or genres or authors. 

### Intents

After creating an entity, we create an intent, which is basically the building block of our agent. Read about it at https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/quick/build-agent
We can manually annotate training phrases of an intent with your created entities. notice that Dialogflow provides several inbuilt entities under @sys. namespace. However, they are not very useful since many book author names are non-US and hence won't be recognized nicely.

We have created two separate intents (ask-book and ask-book-unknown-author), one's in which we are sure of the book authors (can be got by scraping the list of top 10000 most popular book authors), and the other in which we have a catch-all condition using @sys.any system entity. So far both of them are working nicely as expected.
To understand more about this architecture, you can refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI0u6xvazAM (he has some nice videos on dialogflow practicals)
Since sys.person entity is not extendable, we have to use our own separate entity of book authors. We will populate it with raw CSV data.
