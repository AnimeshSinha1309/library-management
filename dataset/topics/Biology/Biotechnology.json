The fact that antibodies can also be detected in the yolk of eggs laid by immunised hens, led to the development of the yolk antibody technology as an alternative method less stressful to animals. Hens can be kept under nearly natural conditions and antibodies be isolated from the eggs. Further, the IgY-technology has the advantage that avian antibodies can be produced against several antigens which do not induce a immune response in mammals. Protocols on how to keep and immunise hens and on the extraction, isolation and use of antibodies from yolk are described in detail in this manual. For their work on yolk antibodies the authors received the FISEA (International Foundation for the Substitution of Animal Experimentation, Luxembourg) prize in 1997.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783662044889"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3662044889"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 255, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7858.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7858.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kPL1CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7858800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7858800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Chicken_Egg_Yolk_Antibodies_Production_a-sample-pdf.acsm?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kPL1CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Tm1yDpbMLYsC", "etag": "bUi6qt5xUxI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Tm1yDpbMLYsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Vision 2050", "subtitle": "Roadmap for a Sustainable Earth", "authors": ["Hiroshi Komiyama", "Steven Kraines"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2008-08-07", "description": "Hiroshi Komiyama's \"Vision 2050\" is a plan for paving a road to global sustainability.

At present the focus is, however, on the issues and problems of significance for livestock producers in the developed world. In order to fully realize the benefits of this technology in developing countries, there is a need to identify, characterize and apply appropriate gene-based technologies for these regions. These proceedings present peer reviewed state-of-the-art papers describing the achievements in the areas of animal breeding and genetics, animal nutrition, animal health, and environment, ethics, safety, and regulatory aspects of gene-based technologies; achievements which could be realized using these modern scientific tools to maximise the benefits from the 'livestock revolution' that is taking place; and the constraints in the use of gene-based technologies and their specific research needs. This book will help in bridging the wide gap between developed and developing countries, in the development and use of gene-based technologies, and to elucidate the current and future roles of such technologies in the developing world.

However, not many sources are available for the pharmaceutical develop ment scientist and other personnel responsible for the commercialization of the finished dosage forms of these new biopharmaceuticals and other products from biotechnology. This text will help to fill this gap. Once active biopharmaceutical molecules are candidates for clinical trial investigation and subsequent commercialization, a number of other activities must take place while research and development on these molecules continues.

Upon reaching these goals, we shall have the understanding to direct and the tools required to implement changes that will dramatically improve the quality of life.

However, most GAs employed in practice nowadays are unable to learn genetic linkage and suffer from the linkage problem. The linkage learning genetic algorithm (LLGA) was proposed to tackle the linkage problem with several specially designed mechanisms. While the LLGA performs much better on badly scaled problems than simple GAs, it does not work well on uniformly scaled problems as other competent GAs. Therefore, we need to understand why it is so and need to know how to design a better LLGA or whether there are certain limits of such a linkage learning process. This book aims to gain better understanding of the LLGA in theory and to improve the LLGA's performance in practice. It starts with a survey of the existing genetic linkage learning techniques and describes the steps and approaches taken to tackle the research topics, including using promoters, developing the convergence time model, and adopting subchromosomes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540284591"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540284598"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 120, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=22&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea.html?hl=&id=kKr3rKhPU7oC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea-sample-epub.acsm?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Extending_the_Scalability_of_Linkage_Lea-sample-pdf.acsm?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kKr3rKhPU7oC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "GADE8oatXV0C", "etag": "ZxugQkiavZ8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/GADE8oatXV0C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Tools and Applications of Biochemical Engineering Science", "authors": ["K.

The importance of computational function prediction is increasing because more and more large scale biological data, including genome sequences, protein structures, protein-protein interaction data, microarray expression data, and mass spectrometry data, are awaiting biological interpretation. Traditionally when a genome is sequenced, function annotation of genes is done by homology search methods, such as BLAST or FASTA. However, since these methods are developed before the genomics era, conventional use of them is not necessarily most suitable for analyzing a large scale data. Therefore we observe emerging development of computational gene function prediction methods, which are targeted to analyze large scale data, and also those which use such omics data as additional source of function prediction. In this book, we overview this emerging exciting field. The authors have been selected from 1) those who develop novel purely computational methods 2) those who develop function prediction methods which use omics data 3) those who maintain and update data base of function annotation of particular model organisms (E. coli), which are frequently referred", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9400708815"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789400708815"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 310, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.7.7.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 17346, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdid=book-UPUZy11Y4c8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17346000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-epub.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Protein_Function_Prediction_for_Omics_Er-sample-pdf.acsm?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UPUZy11Y4c8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Hay9Hw1lbLAC", "etag": "2X09czw919U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Hay9Hw1lbLAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biotechnology in India II", "authors": ["Tarun K.

Furthermore, the company optimistically projects the growth to a factor of five fold only if both the industry and the government are able to put in place achievable solutions that must take care of the formida ble obstacles preventing further growth.

Along with these kinds of questions, majority of the questions in this book have been designed to assess the candidate's understanding of the subject.

I was very fortunate to work for the company that begat the biotech industry during its formative years. This experience established a solid foundation from which I could grow in both the science and business of biotechnology. After my fourth year of working on Oyster Point Boulevard, a close friend and colleague left Genentech to join a start-up biotechnology company. Later, he approached me to leave and join him in of all places \u2013 Oklahoma. He persisted for at least a year before I seriously considered his proposal. After listening to their plans, the opportunity suddenly became more and more intriguing. Finally, I took the plunge and joined this ent- preneurial team in cofounding and growing a start-up biotechnology company. Making that fateful decision to leave the security of a larger company was extremely difficult, but it turned out to be the beginning of an entrepreneurial career that forever changed how I viewed the biotechnology industry. Since that time, I have been fortunate to have cofounded two other biotechnology com- nies and even participated in taking one of them public. During my career in these start-ups, I held a variety of positions, from directing the science, operations, regulatory, and marketing components, to subsequently becoming CEO.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1441900640"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781441900647"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 269, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GQe9xozuENUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GQe9xozuENUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GQe9xozuENUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQe9xozuENUC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQe9xozuENUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10997.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQe9xozuENUC&rdid=book-GQe9xozuENUC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10997600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Business_of_Bioscience-sample-epub.acsm?id=GQe9xozuENUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Business_of_Bioscience-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GQe9xozuENUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GQe9xozuENUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cgwf8oUusBQC", "etag": "iCO1uYQ1emo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cgwf8oUusBQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Physiological Engineering Aspects of Penicillium Chrysogenum", "authors": ["Jens Nielsen"], "publisher": "World Scientific", "publishedDate": "1997", "description": "The book gives a review of penicillin production by Penicillium chrysogenum, and also deals with a number of general aspects of fungal cultivations, e.g. primary metabolism of filamentous fungi, morphology, monitoring of fungal cultivations, and bioreactor performance (more than 750 references).The first two chapters give an introduction to the area of penicillin production; with a review of the history and a survey of the present status of this industrially very important process in the first chapter.

To satisfy these needs, the world's farmers must meet the extra requirement every year. The easiest way in which farmers can increase the amount of food they produce is to prevent the loss due to pests. The biological control measures which were once thought to be the safest methods of pest control have, as we now know, not proved successful on a commercial scale. In such a dismal situation the only solution is to use pesticides to save the losses from pests and to increase the crop yield. Apart from agriculture, pesticides have also contributed much to human com fort by controlling the vectors of typhoid, malaria, sleeping sickness, filariasis, dengue hemorrhage fever, plague etc. On the other hand, the indiscriminate use of insecticides and their harmful effects on nontarget organisms has attracted much attention from people in all walks of life, for example, scientists, administrators, the press and the public. The harmful effects of insecticides on higher organisms such as birds, fish and mammals are easy to observe and have received much attention.

This has significantly increased our knowledge of cellular and developmental biology in general and will certainly continue to do so for a long time to come.

A seminal paper by Blakeslee in 1904 provided evidence for self-incompatibility, termed \"heterothallism\", and stimulated interest in studies related to the control of sexual reproduction in fungi by mating-type specificities. Soon to follow was the demonstration that sexually reproducing fungi exhibit Mendelian inheritance and that it was possible to conduct formal genetic analysis with fungi. The names Burgeff, Kniep and Lindegren are all associated with this early period of fungal genetics research. These studies and the discovery of penicillin by Fleming, who shared a Nobel Prize in 1945, provided further impetus for experimental research with fungi. Thus began a period of interest in mutation induction and analysis of mutants for bio chemical traits. Such fundamental research, conducted largely with Neurospora crassa, led to the one gene: one enzyme hypothesis and to a second Nobel Prize for fungal research awarded to Beadle and Tatum in 1958. Fundamental research in biochemical genetics was extended to other fungi, especially to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and by the mid-1960s fungal systems were much favored for studies in eukaryotic molecular biology and were soon able to compete with bacterial systems in the molecular arena.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783662119082"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3662119080"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 435, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=41&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 6726, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DrXrCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 6726000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Growth_Differentiation_and_Sexuality-sample-pdf.acsm?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DrXrCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "MujUlI7X9IUC", "etag": "HxPOLZACO+c", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MujUlI7X9IUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Cell Engineering", "authors": ["Mohamed Al-Rubeai"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2007-11-23", "description": "Integrating advances in molecular biology into bioprocesses presents a continuous challenge to scientists and bioengineers.

Although mice including genetically modified mice offer many possibilities, other non-murine species are absolutely required in some circumstances. Rabbit is one of these species, which has been widely used in biomedical studies. This animal is genetically and physiologically closer to humans including cardiov- cular system and metabolism characteristics. Rabbit is thus more appropriate than mice to study some diseases such as atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism. Because of its larger size, surgery manipulation, bleeding, and turn-over studies are much easier performed in rabbits than in mice. Furthermore, transgenic rabbits can be produced using microinjection and other methods such as lentiviral v- tors. Cloning in rabbits has been proved possible, even though still laborious and time-consuming. Hopefully, functional rabbit ES cell lines will be available in the coming years. Gene deletion or knock-out in rabbits will then become possible.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789048122271"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9048122279"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 136, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=44&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 11776.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&rdid=book-AYCC8FLbX2wC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 11776400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rabbit_Biotechnology-sample-epub.acsm?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Rabbit_Biotechnology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AYCC8FLbX2wC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "yU89JSZsS30C", "etag": "yRj+GJgI8EU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yU89JSZsS30C", "volumeInfo": {"title": "A Revolution in Biotechnology", "authors": ["Jean L.

The book discusses recent advances and challenges in terms of science, technology, innovation, and policy for the development of the field; and how marine biotechnology may provide new solutions to some of the grand challenges faced by our society. Written in an accessible language, the book is also recommended as a reference text for decision-makers in government and non-governmental organizations in their efforts to foster the development of a global blue economy. With less than 5 % of the vast and rich marine environment explored, our seas and oceans represent a virtually unexplored resource for the discovery of novel product, processes, and development of bio-inspired synthetic drugs with biotechnological potential. As such, the marine environment has been considered Earth's last frontier of exploration. Recent advances in molecular techniques are providing the necessary tools to access on a larger scale the still-untapped ocean resources and, consequently, unveil the promise of the blue biotechnology. Governments are recognizing the potential of marine biotechnology to provide solutions to some of the Grand Challenges of the 21st Century such as sustainable energy and food sources, identification of novel drugs for improved health treatments, and providing new industrial materials and processes. For this reason, advances in marine biotechnology may foster the much-needed source of innovation and economic growth in many countries, and pave the way towards the development of a global blue economy, i.e. a new economic model based on the sustainable exploration of our ocean ecosystems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319690759"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319690752"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 616, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0OJaDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Grand_Challenges_in_Marine_Biotechnology-sample-epub.acsm?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Grand_Challenges_in_Marine_Biotechnology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0OJaDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QsLSBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "UCjghfkXdYg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QsLSBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Genetics and Product Formation in Streptomyces", "authors": ["Simon Baumberg", "Hans Kr\u00fcgel", "Dieter Noack"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "The Streptomycetes are industrially widely used microorganisms due to their ability to produce numerous different chemical compounds. These show very varied effects upon other living systems, and result from profound and subtle biochemical and morphological differentiation during the streptomycete life cycle. It is therefore not surprising that research on the genetics of antibiotic biosynthesis and differentiation in this group is currently progressing rapidly in many countries. Intimately connected with the production of antibiotics is resistance to them; analysis of this is giving further information about the origin and evolution of this class of genes and their hypothesized spread among other microorganisms. Another interesting feature of the Streptomyces group is their mycelial growth. Also, their ecologically important utilization of high molecular weight compounds requires enzymes to be transported outside the cell to hydrolyze non-diffusible substrates. Finally, we have as yet limited understanding of the various mechanisms of genome rearrangement observed in some of these species; deletions and/or amplifications of enormous amounts of DNA can occur without seriously affecting the viability of the organism under laboratory conditions. The present volume, which includes contributions addressing the above subjects and others, originates from a meeting on \"Genetics and Product Formation in Streptomyces\" sponsored by the Federation of European Microbiological Societies in Erfurt on May 1-6 1990. Compared to previous ones of this kind held in 1979, 1983 and 1987 in Weimar, one can point to impressive progress in the study and applications of Streptomyces genetics.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468459227"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468459228"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 340, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-QsLSBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Genetics_and_Product_Formation_in_Strept-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QsLSBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Rn9s1wODILkC", "etag": "QH+kKlaknnE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Rn9s1wODILkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Microbial Biotechnology", "subtitle": "Principles and Applications", "authors": ["Lee Yuan Kun"], "publisher": "World Scientific", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "This work focuses on the various applications of microbial-biotechnological principles.

This handbook examines the remediation of MTBE in existing spills: exploring the myths which act as impediments to successful clean-up techniques, and offering effective solutions. Experience in the last decade has shown that prompt source control is key to minimizing impacts and remediation costs. Successful treatment of contamination depends on the selection of the appropriate technology, well done site characterization, sound engineering design and implementation. The focus of this volume is the remediation of MTBE in existing spills.

The technological hurdles will be formi dable but will not limit what happens: once the basic ideas are available, the technology will be developed. The unique part of biotechnology will be to imagine what the possibilities are. There was a discussion in several of the groups on the problems of intro ducing a novel science into a social and economic context. What biotech nologists are learning on this matter is not novel, although that does not make it any less important or difficult. People in the development of elec tronics and computers, in the pharmaceutical industry, and in many other types of industry that have grown from university research have had to face these problems in the past. It is the old situation of having to reinvent the wheel again and again. There is one aspect on which biotechnology seems to have handled this inherent difficulty better than some of our predecessor technologies: the people in the biotechnology companies by and large take a rather academic approach to free communication with one another at meetings such as this and open publication of many of their basic findings in the literature. This seems unique and certainly is different from the experience of the recent Silicone Valley Industry, which in other ways tries to emulate an academic environment, but not in open and free publication.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642705359"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642705359"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 312, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RirwCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Biotechnology_Potentials_and_Limitations-sample-pdf.acsm?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RirwCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "QcstWYIcbHkC", "etag": "Ta8ZcT9Gvuo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QcstWYIcbHkC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Monocultures of the Mind", "subtitle": "Perspectives on Biodiversity and Biotechnology", "authors": ["Vandana Shiva"], "publisher": "Palgrave Macmillan", "publishedDate": "1993-06-15", "description": "Vandana Shiva has established herself as a leading independent thinker and voice for the South in that critically important nexus where questions of development strategy, the environment and the posititon of women in society coincide. In this new volume, she brings together her thinking on the protection of biodiversity, the implications of biotechnology, and the consequences for agriculture of the global pre-eminence of Western-style scientific knowledge. In lucid and accessible fashion, she examines the current threats to the planet's biodiversity and the environmental and human consequences of its erosion and replacement by monocultural production. She shows how the new Biodiversity Convention has been gravely undermined by a mixture of diplomatic dilution during the process of negotiation and Northern hi-tech interests making money out of the new biotechnologies. She explains what these technologies involve and gives examples of their impact in practice. She questions their claims to improving natural species for the good of all and highlights the ethical and environmental problems posed. Underlying her arguments is the view that the North's particular approach to scientific understanding has led to a system of monoculture in agriculture - a model that is not being foisted on the South, displacing its societies' ecologically sounder, indigenous and age-old experiences of truly sustainable food cultivation, forest management and animal husbandry. This rapidly accelerating process of technology and system transfer is impoverishing huge numbers of people, disrupting the social systems that provide them with security and dignity, and will ultimately result in a sterile planet in both North and South, In a policy intervention of potentially great significance, she calls instead for a halt, at international as well as local level, to the aid and market incentives to both large-scale destruction of habitats where biodiversity thrives and the introduction of centralised, homogenous systems of cultivation.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1856492184"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781856492188"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 184, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Monocultures_of_the_Mind.html?hl=&id=QcstWYIcbHkC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QcstWYIcbHkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rVztCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "e5MibrQ9kb8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rVztCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Biophotons", "authors": ["Jiin-Ju Chang", "Joachim Fisch", "Fritz-Albert Popp"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "It is now well established that all living systems emit a weak but permanent photon flux in the visible and ultraviolet range.

By fabricating at the nanoscale, it is possible to exert unprecedented control on drug activity. This textbook will showcase a variety of nanosystems working from their design and construction to their application in the field of drug delivery. The book is intended for graduate students in drug delivery, physical and polymer chemistry, and applied pharmaceutical sciences courses that involve fundamental nanoscience. The purpose of the text is to present physicochemical and biomedical properties of synthetic polymers with an emphasis on their application in polymer therapeutics i.e., pharmaceutical nanosystems, drug delivery and biological performance. There are two main objectives of this text. The first is to provide advanced graduate students with knowledge of the principles of nanosystems and polymer science including synthesis, structure, and characterization of solution and solid state properties. The second is to describe the fundamentals of therapeutic applications of polymers in drug delivery, targeting, response modifiers as well as regulatory issues. The courses, often listed as Advanced Drug Delivery and Applied Pharmaceutics; Polymer Therapeutics; or Nanomedicine, are designed as an overview of the field specifically for graduate students in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Programs. However, the course content may also be of interest for graduate students in related biomedical research programs. These courses generally include a discussion of the major principles of polymer science and fundamental concepts of application of polymers as modern therapeutics. All courses are moving away from the above mentioned course names and going by \u2018pharmaceutical nanoscience or nanosystems\u2019.

In this book, readers will also learn about the challenges of solid state fermentation, including process management, reactor design, scale-up and the formation of process-specific products. Solid fermentation is a traditional cultivation technique of food technology and involves all cultivations of microorganisms on a solid substrate without free liquid phase. In the course of development of Biotechnology it was replaced by liquid cultivation mainly in the western countries. Over the past few years, solid-state fermentation is now becoming more important and has moved more back into focus. Especially, it is suitable for the cultivation of filamentous organisms, like ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, but also for various yeasts and bacteria. The products and applications of solid-state fermentation are as diverse as the microorganisms. They range from enzyme production to the production of antibiotics and pigments to the use in environmental technology and energy production.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030236755"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030236757"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 172, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=83&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 19352, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 19352, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hwSjDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19352000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19352000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Solid_State_Fermentation-sample-epub.acsm?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Solid_State_Fermentation-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hwSjDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "MVw6NSJ6p1sC", "etag": "fSHJ64MmRbk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MVw6NSJ6p1sC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Morphology Genetic Materials Templated from Nature Species", "authors": ["Di Zhang"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2014-07-08", "description": "Morphology Genetic Materials Templated from Nature Species provides a comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of research on bio-inspired functional materials including materials science and engineering aspects of the fabrication, properties, and applications.

In addition to summarizing and detailing developed diagnostic devices, this book will attempt to point out the possible future trends of development for point-of-care diagnostics using both scientifically based research and practical engineering needs with the aim to help novices comprehensively understand the development of point-of-care diagnostics. This includes demonstrating several common but critical principles and mechanisms used in point-of-care diagnostics that address practical needs (e.g., disease or healthcare monitoring) using two well-developed examples so far: 1) blood glucose meters (via electrochemistry); and, 2) pregnancy tests (via lateral flow assay). Readers of this book will come to fully comprehend how to develop point-of-care diagnostics devices, and will be inspired to contribute to a critical global cause \u2013 the development of inexpensive, effective, and portable in vitro diagnostics tools (for any purpose) that can be used either at home or in resource limited areas.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319197371"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319197371"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 106, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7068.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7068.2, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-HD8wCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7068200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7068200000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/In_Vitro_Diagnostic_Devices-sample-epub.acsm?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/In_Vitro_Diagnostic_Devices-sample-pdf.acsm?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HD8wCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "EOXnCwAAQBAJ", "etag": "5WHGeIjPmNI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EOXnCwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Science, the State and the City", "subtitle": "Britain's Struggle to Succeed in Biotechnology", "authors": ["Geoffrey Owen", "Michael M.

The most important application of biotechnology has been in medicine, in the development of new drugs. The central purpose of the book is to explain how firms based in the US took the lead in commercialising the technology, and why it has been so difficult for firms in other countries to match what the leading American companies have achieved. The book looks at the institutions and policies which have underpinned US success in biotechnology. This is the US innovation \"ecosystem,\" and it is made up of several interlocking elements which constitute a powerful competitive advantage for US biotechnology firms. These include, a higher education system which has close links with industry, massive support from the Federal government for biomedical research, and a financial system which is well equipped to support young entrepreneurial firms in a science-based industry. In the light of US experience the book examines in detail the performance of UK biotechnology firms over the past forty years, starting with the creation of the UK's first dedicated biotech firm, Celltech, in 1980. The book shows how the UK made a promising start in the 1980s and 1990s but failed to build on it. Several leading firms failed, and after an initial burst of enthusiasm investors lost confidence in the British biotech sector. It is only the last few years that the sector has staged a revival, attracting fresh investment from the US as well from the UK. The story told in this book, based on extensive interviews with industry participants, investors, and policy makers in the UK, Continental Europe, and the US, sheds new light on one of the central issues facing governments in the advanced industrial countries - how to create and sustain new science-based industries.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780198728009"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "019872800X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EOXnCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EOXnCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EOXnCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EOXnCwAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Science_the_State_and_the_City.html?hl=&id=EOXnCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EOXnCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "_1CDeCrRipEC", "etag": "7pTbuTNJuMg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_1CDeCrRipEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Becoming Biosubjects", "subtitle": "Bodies, Systems, Technologies", "authors": ["Neil Gerlach", "Sheryl N.

The authors argue that the human body is now being understood as something that is fluid and without fixed meaning. This has significant implications both for how we understand ourselves and how we see our relationships with other forms of life. Focusing on four major issues, the authors examine the ways in which genetic technologies are shaping criminal justice practices, how policies on reproductive technologies have shifted in response to biotechnologies, the debates surrounding the patenting of higher life forms, and the Canadian (and global) response to bioterrorism. Regulatory strategies in government and the courts are continually evolving and are affected by changing public perceptions of scientific knowledge. The legal and cultural shifts outlined in Becoming Biosubjects call into question what it means to be a Canadian, a citizen, and a human being.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780802099839"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0802099831"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 216, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Law"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_1CDeCrRipEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_1CDeCrRipEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_1CDeCrRipEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_1CDeCrRipEC&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Biosubjects.html?hl=&id=_1CDeCrRipEC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Becoming_Biosubjects-sample-epub.acsm?id=_1CDeCrRipEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_1CDeCrRipEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "xmn7CAAAQBAJ", "etag": "OjlPME508W8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xmn7CAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Plant Proteins from European Crops", "subtitle": "Food and Non-Food Applications", "authors": ["Jacques Gueguen", "Yves Popineau"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "Jointly published with INRA, Paris Plant proteins are regarded as versatile, functional ingredients or as active biological compounds, and as essential nutrients in food.

Many patients suffering with life-threatening diseases or chronic dysfunctions, which were medically untreatable not long ago, can attest to the wonder these drugs have achieved. Although the ?rst generation of p- tein therapeutics was produced in recombinant Escherichia coli, most recent products use mammalian cells as production hosts. Not long after the ?rst p- duction of recombinant proteins in E. coli, it was realized that the complex tasks of most post-translational modi?cations on proteins could only be ef?ciently carried out in mammalian cells. In the 1990s, we witnessed a rapid expansion of mammalian-cell-derived protein therapeutics, chie?y antibodies. In fact, it has been nearly a decade since the market value of mammalian-cell-derived protein therapeutics surpassed that of those produced from E. coli. A common characteristic of recent antibody products is the relatively large dose required for effective therapy, demanding larger quantities for the treatment of a given disease. This, coupled with the broadening repertoire of protein drugs, has rapidly expanded the quantity needed for clinical applications. The increasing demand for protein therapeutics has not been met exclusively by construction of new manufacturing plants and increasing total volume capacity. More - portantly the productivity of cell culture processes has been driven upward by an order of magnitude in the past decade.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540340072"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540340076"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 168, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-iRm5BQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cell_Culture_Engineering-sample-pdf.acsm?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iRm5BQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LaBU4INBruAC", "etag": "+9fC+okxBPo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LaBU4INBruAC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Alkaloid Synthesis", "authors": ["Hans-Joachim Kn\u00f6lker"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-01-10", "description": "Lycopodium Alkaloids: Isolation and Asymmetric Synthesis, by Mariko Kitajima and Hiromitsu Takayama.- Synthesis of Morphine Alkaloids and Derivatives, by Uwe Rinner and Tomas Hudlicky.- Indole Prenylation in Alkaloid Synthesis, by Thomas Lindel, Nils Marsch and Santosh Kumar Adla.- Marine Pyrroloiminoquinone Alkaloids, by Yasuyuki Kita and Hiromichi Fujioka.- Synthetic Studies on Amaryllidaceae and Other Terrestrially Derived Alkaloids, by Martin G.

The 1970s were also the cradle period of biotechnology, and the years when biotechnical utilization of lignocellulosic waste from agriculture and forestry gained priori ty. This was a logical conclusion since one of nature's most important biologi cal reactions is the conversion of wood and other lignocellulosic materials to carbon dioxide, water and humic substances. However, while biotechnology in other areas like medicine and pharmacology concerned production of expen sive products on a small scale, biotechnical utilization and conversion of ligno cellulosics meant production of inexpensive products on a large scale. Biotechnical utilization of lignocellulosic materials is therefore a very difficult task, and the commercial utilization of this technology has not progressed as rapidly as one would have desired. One reason for this was the lack of basic knowledge of enzyme mechanisms involved in the degradation and conversion of wood, other lignocellulosics and their individual components. There are also risks associated with initiating a technical development before a stable platform of knowledge is available. Several of the projects started with en thusiasm have therefore suffered some loss of interest. Also contributing to this failing interest is the fact that the oil crisis at the time was not a real one. At present, nobody predicts a rapid exhaustion of the oil resources and fuel production from lignocellulosics is no longer a high priority.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642466878"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642466877"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 407, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-urz3CAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Microbial_and_Enzymatic_Degradation_of_W-sample-pdf.acsm?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=urz3CAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "U8htC86rSmUC", "etag": "4i6GZ+BC4xI", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/U8htC86rSmUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms", "subtitle": "Comparative Approaches", "authors": ["Luc Bodiguel", "Michael Cardwell"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press on Demand", "publishedDate": "2010", "description": "The regulation of genetically modified organisms continues to generate controversy.

The authors do not treat society and biotechnology as separate domains, instead they consider technologies as socially constructed. The main focus of this publication is on agro-biotechnologies and the contributors present perspectives for reconstruction both from and in 'the North' and 'the South'. Reconstructing biotechnologies offers a range of critical social analyses confronting the actuality of biotechnology with the potentialities of its social reconstruction. In doing that, the book develops and merges literature from four different disciplines, namely (i) critical theory and its analyses of technology and power, (ii) political economy, critically assessing the interrelationship between economy, politics and technology, (iii) social constructivism, which holds that technology is the product of agency and knowledge systems, and (iv) the analysis of rural society and agrarian technologies in rural sociology. Reconstructing biotechnologies introduces exciting approaches and examples into the social reshaping of biotechnologies. It brings together critical examinations of contemporary biotechnology development and puts forward possible alternatives written by critical scholars. The contributions in this publication are for students and scholars in a wide range of disciplines such as social and political sciences, science and technology studies, and development studies. The editors of the book are associated with the Social Sciences Department of Wageningen University in the Netherlands and the Graduate School of Economics of Kyoto University in Japan.

Research is proceeding at jet speed on renewable energy (energy derived from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, tides, rain, geothermal heat, biomass, hydrogen, etc.) as policy makers, researchers, economists, and world agencies have joined forces in finding alternative sustainable energy solutions to current critical environmental, economic, and social issues. The innovative models, environmentally benign processes, data analytics, etc. employed in renewable energy systems are computationally-intensive, non-linear and complex as well as involve a high degree of uncertainty. Soft computing technologies, such as fuzzy sets and systems, neural science and systems, evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming, and machine learning, are ideal in handling the noise, imprecision, and uncertainty in the data, and yet achieve robust, low-cost solutions. As a result, intelligent and soft computing paradigms are finding increasing applications in the study of renewable energy systems.

The organisms addressed include plants, insects, fungi, bacteria and phages. Bioprospecting has never been more relevant and is of renewed interest, because of the extremely worrying rise in novel, resistant pathogenic microorganisms. The practices in pharmaceutical companies have failed to deliver novel antibiotics to control these infections. We need to look for new sources of drugs from the environment on a massive scale as drug discovery is \u201ctoo important to fail\u201d. Furthermore, the field can add great value to ecosystems in terms of economics, while providing additional reasons for maintaining associated services, such as food provision, benign climate, effective nutrient cycling and cultural practices. Bioprospecting provides another reason why climate change must be reduced in order to preserve relevant environments. Previous bioprospecting projects should be re-visited and established biodiversity centres have a major role. Many different ecosystems exist which contain unique organisms with the potential to supply novel antibiotics, enzymes, food, and cosmetics, or they may simply have aesthetic value. The book stresses the difficulties in obtaining successful products and yet describes why natural products should be investigated over combinatorial chemistry. Personal experience of bioprospecting projects are given significance. Issues such as how to share the benefits equitably with local communities are described and why pharmaceutical companies can be reluctant to be involved. Legal issues are discussed. Finally, there has never been a better time for a new book on bioprospecting, because of the need to preserve ecosystems, and from the emergence of resistant pathogenic microorganisms.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319479354"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319479350"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 303, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-5CG1DQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bioprospecting-sample-epub.acsm?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Bioprospecting-sample-pdf.acsm?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5CG1DQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "JY7CoQEQ2RQC", "etag": "gEiEJ1CwHbw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JY7CoQEQ2RQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Sterile Filtration", "authors": ["Maik W.

A critical assessment of the sustainable fishing methods and the aspect of sustainable aquaculture feed is presented in this volume. A special focus has been given to socio-economic and environmental assessment of aquaculture practices and analysis of carbon footprint under an intensive aquaculture regime. Aquaponics as a niche for sustainable modern aquaculture has been highlighted. The effect of use of pharmaceuticals to prevent fish disease on the surrounding marine environment is an emerging area of concern, and a critical discussion on this aspect is included in the book.

Algae-derived biofuels and bioproducts offer great promise in contributing to U.S. energy security and in mitigating the environmental concerns associated with conventional fuels. Algae\u2019s ability to grow in low quality water/wastewater and to accumulate lipids has encouraged scientists to investigate algae as a medium for wastewater treatment and a potential source of fuel and bioproducts. There are growing demands for biomass-based transportation fuels, including biodiesel, bio-oil, biomethane, biohydrogen, and other high-value products (nutraceuticals, proteins, omega-3 etc.).

Solar pasteurization can be a useful means of producing water at remote, but sunny locations where fuel may not be easily available for boiling water. Membrane desalination will remain as a viable means of drinking water production for individual households to large communities. Various membrane filtration techniques as well as the means to \u201cdemocratize\u201d membrane filtration have been presented. Riverbank filtration is a \u201cnatural\u201d filtration technique where drinking water is produced by placing wells on the banks of rivers.

In exploiting the mind's capacity for instrumental behavior, posthumanists seek to extend human experience by physically projecting the mind outward through the continuity of thought and the material world, as through telepresence and other forms of prosthetic enhancements. Posthumanism envisions a biology/machine symbiosis that will promote this extension, arguably at the expense of the natural tendency of the mind to move toward pure consciousness. As each chapter of this book contends, by forcibly overextending and thus jeopardizing the neurophysiology of consciousness, the posthuman condition could in the long term undermine human nature, defined as the effortless capacity for transcending the mind's conceptual content.Presented here for the first time, the essential argument of this book is more than a warning; it gives a direction: far better to practice patience and develop pure consciousness and evolve into a higher human being than to fall prey to the Faustian temptations of biotechnological power. As argued throughout the book, each person must choose for him or herself between the technological extension of physical experience through mind, body and world on the one hand, and the natural powers of human consciousness on the other as a means to realize their ultimate vision.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9789042019485"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "9042019484"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Art"], "averageRating": 1, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Biotechnology&hl=&cd=111&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZruZstRV4UMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 3021.91, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 3021.91, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&rdid=book-ZruZstRV4UMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3021910000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 3021910000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cyberculture_Cyborgs_and_Science_Fiction-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Cyberculture_Cyborgs_and_Science_Fiction-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZruZstRV4UMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "rVmBAAAAQBAJ", "etag": "rHsnJmEZIWw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rVmBAAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Growth Cultures", "subtitle": "The Global Bioeconomy and Its Bioregions", "authors": ["Philip Cooke", "Professor of Regional Development Philip Cooke"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2013-08-21", "description": "This groundbreaking book is the first comparative analysis of the relative strengths of global bioregions.

The book begins by discussing the philosophical foundations of Humanity 2.0, drawing attention to how recent changes in the conduct of science and its social relations reflect implicit changes in human self-understanding. Here three possible futures of 'being human' are sketched and ideologically interrelated: the ecological, the biomedical and the cybernetic. Then the book moves to Humanity 2.0's emerging political economy, which involves the redefinition of classical political and economic concepts, such as justice and productivity. Next the book turns to Humanity 2.0's 'anthropology', which means the living conditions and aspirations available to this new being. Then Humanity 2.0's ethical horizons are considered, focusing on the normative sensibility of the 'moral entrepreneur', a natural risk-taker whose blurring of traditional intuitions of 'good' and 'evil' may acquire greater significance and legitimacy in the future.

The author considers biodiversity and bioprospecting as a response to food security issues, drug-resistance, nutrition-poor diets and other problems, exploring the prospects of several under-utilized nutrients and bioactive repositories. Readers will discover biochemical makeups, validated health benefits, explanations of underlying mechanisms, hurdles in the path of popularity and promotion strategies. Chapters explore particular plants, seeds and fruits including the strawberry guava, opuntia fruits, the Carissa genus, grape seeds, quinoa and the milk thistle (Silybum), amongst others. They are considered as food sources where possible and from the perspective of the roles they can play in complementary and alternative medicine, such as in wound healing, antimicrobial activity, gastroprotective activity in treatment of cancers and as natural antioxidant sources. This rich compilation holds plausible solutions to a range of current issues and it endorses the much-needed goal of sustainability in terms of diet and drugs.

Also explained are techniques for recovering pressure-loving bacteria, the barophiles (piezophiles), and for whole genome analysis of Bacillus halodurans C-125. Physiological analysis of the pressure effect in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli is used to answer the question of how deep-sea organisms survive under high hydrostatic pressure. These research results are useful in both basic science and industrial applications.

Yet, modern viticulture must face several challenges. Global climate has increased berry sugar content (and alcohol in the wine) whereas phenolic and aromatic ripeness are not always achieved. Water supply is becoming shorter. New varieties better adapted to new climatic conditions might have to be planted, which may affect wine typicity. Phytochemical treatments are more controlled, and the consumer pays increasing attention to environmentally safe practices. New methods reducing pesticide use, but maintaining yield and typicity, must be designed. The present book illustrates the recent progress made in ecophysiology, molecular and cell biology, and pathology of grapevine, as well as in precision viticulture and berry composition. Combination of these new tools with field observations will undoubtly make it easier to face the challenges described above.
