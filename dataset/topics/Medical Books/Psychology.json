Some 40% of the adult population has tried mari juana at least once. It is the third largest agricultural commodity in the nation and a $10 billion industry. In many areas of the country, marijuana production or sale is the largest moneymaker by far. In Florida, for ex ample, it ranks ahead of every business except tourism. It is also a widely misunderstood substance. An en tire generation of Americans grew up believing that marijuana was virtually risk-free. This belief persists, despite growing evidence of physical, psychological, and social harm that is caused by the drug. The worst victims of this misinformation are young people. They, of all groups, are the least equipped to uncover and objectively evaluate the evidence regarding marijuana. At the same time, they are the most at risk for long-term problems resulting from marijuana use. v PREFACE vi As physicians we must make every effort to guide young people away from this drug. There are very significant dangers in young people experimenting with marijuana. The drug detoxification center at our hospital-and centers throughout the country-are packed with middle-class young people who started out smoking pot. None of them intended to become addicted, but the fact is that young people are more vulnerable to the influence of the drugs and become dependent easily. They may escalate usage, and progress to use of other drugs.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781489934932"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1489934936"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 260, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8401.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-OzEBCAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8401600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Marijuana-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OzEBCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "7VB6mNz7IUoC", "etag": "flHqfUAzJpA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7VB6mNz7IUoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Research", "subtitle": "Evidence-Based Practice and Practice-Based Evidence", "authors": ["Raymond A.

Besides focusing on specific pathologies as they affect the course of intellectual disability (ID), its coverage spans the field from in-depth analyses of psychosocial aspects of ID to promising new findings in genetics and the ongoing challenge of providing personalized care tailored to individual client needs.

Comorbid psychopathology, including mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. Common clinical conditions, such as ADHD, autism, and behavior problems. Medical and psychological interventions as well as community and inpatient services. Future directions in research and evidence-based practices.

Its popularity among society and the professional community is growing by leaps and bounds. What is it and what are its limits? What is the fundamental nature of cognitive therapy? It is, to my way of thinking, simple but profound. To understand it, it is useful to think back to the history of behavior therapy, to the basic development made by Joseph Wolpe. In the 1950s, Wolpe astounded the therapeutic world and infuriated his colleagues by finding a simple cure for phobias. The psychoanalytic establishment held that phobias-irrational and intense fear of certain objects, such as cats-were just surface manifesta tions of deeper, underlying disorders. The psychoanalysts said their source was the buried fear in male children of castration by the father in retaliation for the son's lust for his mother. For females, this fear is directed toward the opposite sex parent. The biomedical theorists, on the other hand, claimed that some as yet undiscovered disorder in brain chemistry must be the underlying problem. Both groups insisted that to treat only the patient's fear of cats would do no more good than it would to put rouge over measles. Wolpe, however, reasoned that irrational fear of something isn't just a symptom of a phobia; it is the whole phobia.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781475797770"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "147579777X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 396, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 8826.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 8826.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-sKzTBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8826400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 8826400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Comprehensive_Casebook_of_Cognitive_Ther-sample-pdf.acsm?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sKzTBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "VcCxDAAAQBAJ", "etag": "fSHPWFU4fC4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VcCxDAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Psychiatric Interview for Differential Diagnosis", "authors": ["Lennart Jansson", "Julie Nordgaard"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2016-07-18", "description": "This book offers an alternative to operational diagnostic manuals and manuals for structured interviewing as the only sources of theoretical and clinical knowledge.

Professors Agne Larsson, MD, Tore Schersten, MD and Bjorn Smedby, MD in particular showed a keen interest and it was decided to hold a State-of-the-Art-Conference on autism in Gothenburg. The State-of-the-Art-Conference on Autism -Diagnosis and Treatment was held in Gothenburg May 8 -10, 1989. A panel of international experts was selected because of outstanding research or clinical activity in the field and in order to represent a wide variety of professional and theoretical approaches ranging from epidemiology, neurobiology and cognitive psychology to psychiatry, neurology, education, behavioural treatment and psychoanalysis. A group of professional observers involved in the field of autism was chosen so as to cover Sweden in a representative fashion.

Both electronic and print media continuously warn us that juvenile offenders are increasingly younger and more virulent. The demographics of our population suggest that there will only be more juvenile offenders to fear in the near future. All of these concerns arise in a social climate that is characterized by an ever increasing demand for stronger retributive measures against the offender. The belief that only harsh justice will protect us from the ravages of juveniles has become dominant. Increasingly, perceptions and politics, rather than scientific data, dominate policy making with regard to youthful offenders. In Assessing the Youthful Offender: Issues and Techniques, Robert D. Hoge and D. A. Andrews make a restrained, rational, and ultimately persuasive argu ment for the use of standardized psychological assessments in the effective management of youth within juvenile justice systems. They clarify how what we already know about the cause and management of youthful criminal activity can be incorporated into standardized testing and that the information obtained from testing can improve the administration of criminal justice. Moreover, this informa tion is useful whatever the theoretical biases of those who administer the justice system. The efficiency of policies of either retribution, deterrence, or rehabilitation is only enhanced by reliance on data.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "030645467X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306454677"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 139, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ht6HHJP62l4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ht6HHJP62l4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ht6HHJP62l4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ht6HHJP62l4C&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Assessing_the_Youthful_Offender.html?hl=&id=Ht6HHJP62l4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Assessing_the_Youthful_Offender-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Ht6HHJP62l4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ht6HHJP62l4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "4HmgBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "ea6v3uf/JZg", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/4HmgBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Dementia", "authors": ["Allen Jack Edwards"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29", "description": "Dementia is a state that has implications for several groups.

Second, there are those professionals and caregivers who work di rectly with patients and other caregivers and who must assess and apply interventions.

The needs and stresses of those who care for and about those with progressive dementia are among the most intense imaginable. They need support of many kinds, frequently without knowing what to ask or of whom to ask it. Finally, there are the patients, who increasingly become dependent as their mental competencies decline.

Its importance is self-evident. During the last decade, science, especial ly medical practice, has become an increasingly complex under taking. Recent dramatic developments in medicine have given rise to both theoretical controversies and practical dilemmas. Society is struggling with new scientific, economic, cultural, and legal issues. The establishment of a series such as this appears vital for lawyers and physicians, for sociologists and psychologists, and for the pub lic at large. The editorial board of the Medicolegal Library consists of dis tinguished scientists from many different countries and disciplines. Judge Amnon Carmi acts as principal series editor. Judge Carmi is the author of many books and articles on medical law, and is Editor in-Chief of Medicine and Law: An International Journal. The Medicolegal Library will issue two books each year. The first four books, soon to be published, will deal with child abuse, euthanasia, disability, and nursing, laws and ethics. It is the wish and intention of Springer-Verlag that the Medicole gal Library play an important role throughout the world in the study and understanding of the field of medicine and law, for the benefit of both professions and of mankind at large.

These states were assessed by applying content analysis scales to transcripts of their descriptions of their current experiences. Analyses of the diabetics' scale scores re vealed a pattern characterized by much anxiety, depression, anger expressed both direct ly and indirectly, together with feelings of helplessness. The sources of anxiety which proved to be of most importance to them were fears of death and bodily mutilation, as weIl as guilt and shame. They experienced little sense of sharing with most people around them, although they showed considerable enjoyment of dose relationships with family and friends. This pattern of psychological states did not vary with the sex of the patients or whether they were interviewed in a hospital or at horne nor with recency of onset or multiplicity of health problems. It was similar to the pattern of patients with other chronic diseases but differed significantly from that of the healthy group.

Salmon, Nicholas Rescher, Larry Laudan, Carl G. Hempel, and Robert S. Cohen. To present the book within the Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science was altogether fitting and natural, for Griinbaum has' been friend and supporter of philosophy of science at Boston University for twenty-five years, and unofficial godfather to the Boston Colloquium. To regret that we could not include contributions from all his well-wishers, critical admirers and admiring critics, is only to regret that we did not have an encyclopedic space at the committee's disposal. But we, and all involved in this book, speak for all the others in the philo sophical, scientific, and personal worlds of Adolf Griinbaum in greeting him on May 15, 1983, with our wishes for his health, his scholarship, his happiness. Our gratitude is due to Carolyn Fawcett for her care and accuracy in editing this book, and for the preparation of the Index; and to Elizabeth McMunn for her help again and again, especially in preparation of the Bibliography of the Published Writings of Adolf Griinbaum; and to Thelma Griinbaum for encouraging, planning, and cheering.

The range of outcomes considered span from health-limiting (e.g. mental illness, substance use, unhealthy life style behaviours) to health-promoting (e.g. resilience and posttraumatic growth). These outcomes are examined both in relation to mothers\u2019 experience of motherhood and parenting, and with regard to their children\u2019s lives. Interpersonal trauma, experienced in childhood and/or or adulthood, can have a profound effect on how women experience the transition into motherhood \u2013 from pregnancy, to childbirth, and postpartum caregiving. Women across the globe are exposed to high rates of interpersonal violence, and face the physical and emotional consequences of such events. The shift into motherhood is an emotionally evocative period in a woman\u2019s life, entailing not only challenges, but also the potential for healing and growth. Individual chapters will present state-of-the-art research, and will also highlight the voices of women who have personally experienced trauma, illustrating the effects on their experiences as mothers.

This book is designed to provide short-answer question-based learning centering around the core curriculum topics in geriatric psychiatry and is primarily ideal not only for medical students, residents, and fellows, but also for psychiatrists preparing for re-certification. This book features approximately 300 short-answer questions on geriatric psychiatry topics, each comprising the stem of a brief clinical scenario or concise question with expected number of answers. The book also features detailed teaching notes, graphics, and the respective source references. The format is consistently structured from chapter to chapter, practical and concise, and designed to enhance the reader\u2019s diagnostic and management ability and clinical understanding. Each answer includes a concise discussion, pertinent illustrations, and source references. This text is a valuable reference and teaching tool that provides an opportunity for learning across a rapidly growing field. The material covered matches the existing postgraduate curricula in geriatric psychiatry and helps prepare candidates for their specialty and subspecialty certification examinations. The cases map well to both the American Geriatric Psychiatry Association and Canadian Academy of Geriatric Psychiatry as well as other international postgraduate curricula. The book covers main topics within geriatric psychiatry, some such as substance use disorders and sexuality and sexual dysfunction in later life. As the Baby Boomers age, this reference will continue to be a valuable staple in geriatric workforce training.

This interest has been further heightened by a series of controversies associated with the development of DSM-5 including the fate of proposedrevisions of the personality disorders, bereavement, and the autism spectrum. Major debate arose within the DSM process about the criteria for changing criteria, leading to the creation of first the Scientific Review Committee and then a series of other oversight committees which weighed in on thefinal debates on the most controversial proposed additions to DSM-5, providing important influences on the final decisions. Contained within these debates were a range of conceptual and philosophical issues. Some of these - such as the definition of mental disorder or the problems of psychiatric\"epidemics\" - have been with the field for a long time. Others - the concept of epistemic iteration as a framework for the introduction of nosologic change - are quite new.This book reviews issues within psychiatric nosology from clinical, historical and particularly philosophical perspectives. The book brings together a range of distinguished authors - including major psychiatric researchers, clinicians, historians and especially nosologists - including severalleaders of the DSM-5 effort and the DSM Steering Committee. It also includes contributions from psychologists with a special interest in psychiatric nosology and philosophers with a wide range of orientations. The book is organized into four major sections: * The first explores the nature of psychiatric illness and the way in which it is defined, including clinical and psychometric perspectives. * The second section examines problems in the reification of psychiatric diagnostic criteria, the problem of psychiatric epidemics, and the nature and definition of individual symptoms. * The third section explores the concept of epistemic iteration as a possible governing conceptual framework for the revision efforts for official psychiatric nosologies such as DSM and ICD and the problems of validation of psychiatric diagnoses.* The book ends by exploring how we might move from the descriptive to the etiologic in psychiatric diagnoses, the nature of progress in psychiatric research, and the possible benefits of moving to a living document (or continuous improvement) model for psychiatric nosologic systems. The result is a book that captures the dynamic cross-disciplinary interactions that characterize the best work in the philosophy of psychiatry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780198796022"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0198796021"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 448, "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.2.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Avd0DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Avd0DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Avd0DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Avd0DgAAQBAJ&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_Issues_in_Psychiatry_IV.html?hl=&id=Avd0DgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Avd0DgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "cLnsMxjbEqQC", "etag": "Ke8U4hFjLYU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/cLnsMxjbEqQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Progress in Optical Fibers Research", "authors": ["Zhijian Guo"], "publisher": "Nova Publishers", "publishedDate": "2007", "description": "This book presents new and important research on optical fibres.

In smaller diameter core fibres, (widely used for most communication links longer than 200 meters) the confinement relies on establishing a waveguide. Fibre optics is the overlap of applied science and engineering concerned with such optical fibres. Optical fibres are widely used in fibre-optic communication, which permits transmission over longer distances and at higher data rates than other forms of wired and wireless communications. They are also used to form sensors, and in a variety of other applications. The term optical fibre covers a range of different designs including graded-index optical fibres, step-index optical fibres, birefringent polarisation-maintaining fibres and more recently photonic crystal fibres, with the design and the wavelength of the light propagating in the fiber dictating whether or not it will be multi-mode optical fibre or single-mode optical fibre. Because of the mechanical properties of the more common glass optical fibres, special methods of splicing fibres and of connecting them to other equipment are needed. Manufacture of optical fibres is based on partially melting a chemically doped preform and pulling the flowing material on a draw tower. Fibers are built into different kinds of cables depending on how they will be used.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1600218687"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781600218682"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 419, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cLnsMxjbEqQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cLnsMxjbEqQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cLnsMxjbEqQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cLnsMxjbEqQC&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Progress_in_Optical_Fibers_Research.html?hl=&id=cLnsMxjbEqQC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Progress_in_Optical_Fibers_Research-sample-pdf.acsm?id=cLnsMxjbEqQC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cLnsMxjbEqQC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "AeaNBQAAQBAJ", "etag": "xcnfNSWl5cA", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AeaNBQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Oxford Assess and Progress: Psychiatry", "authors": ["Katharine Boursicot"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "publishedDate": "2014", "description": "Progress to exam success with Oxford Assess and Progress: Psychiatry!

Research on tryptophan and its derivatives provides an inexhaustible subject. At the conference we tried to compose a multifacetted picture of the recent investiga tions through contributions from the major disciplines involved. Thus, we tried to strike a balance between basic research topics and clinical, nutritional or industrial applica tions. We offered workshops on tryptophan (in sleep and mood), melatonjn, IDO-acti vation and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) as a platform for intensive discussion for the participants. In these proceedings many contributions are multidisciplinary and have practical or theoretical implications for different research fields.

It presents a new model of malingering and related biases, and develops a \u201cdiagnostic\u201d system based on it that is applicable to PTSD, chronic pain, and TBI. Included are suggestions for effective practice and future research based on the literature reviews and the new systems, which are useful also because they can be used readily by psychiatrists as much as psychologists. In Malingering, Feigning, and Response Style Assessment in Psychiatric/Psychological Injury, Dr. Young ambitiously sets out to articulate and synthesize the polarities involved in the assessment of response styles in psychological disabilities, including PTSD, pain, and TBI. He does so thoroughly and very even-handedly, neither minimizing the degree that outright faking can be found in substantial numbers of examinees, nor disregarding the possibility that there can be causes for validity test failure other than malingering. He reviews the prior systems for classifying evidence of malingering, and proposes his own criteria for feigned PTSD. These are conservative and well-grounded in the prior literature. Finally, the book contains dozens of very recent references, giving testament to Dr. Young's immersion in the personal injury literature, as might be expected from his experience as founder and Editor in Chief for Psychological Injury and the Law.

Edward Jorden showed that hysteria and not demons lay behind the witch-craze. Edward Jorden's Briefe Discourse of a Disease Called the Suffocation of the Mother (1603) is said to have reclaimed the demoniacally possessed for medicine and to have introduced the concept of hysteria into English psychiatry. The aim of this book is to reassess the reasons why Jorden wrote his famous pamphlet and to set it in its actual historical context. This book brings Jorden's pamphlet together with two works by Jorden's adversaries, John Swann's A True and Breife Report of Mary Glovers Vexation and Stephen Bradwell's `Mary Glovers late Woeful Case', which has never before been published. Both of these concern the incident that provoked Jorden's Briefe Discourse, and they show that his pamphlet was in fact prompted by a bitter religious and political controversy over the case. Michael MacDonald, in his introduction provides a fresh and realistic analysis of the politics of credulity and scepticism in early modern England and Jorden's part in them.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415017886"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0415017882"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 150, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BEfpkxNHR2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BEfpkxNHR2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BEfpkxNHR2oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BEfpkxNHR2oC&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Witchcraft_and_Hysteria_in_Elizabethan_L.html?hl=&id=BEfpkxNHR2oC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BEfpkxNHR2oC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "13QGCAAAQBAJ", "etag": "DTtShpMftfo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/13QGCAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Structure and Spontaneity in Clinical Prose", "subtitle": "A Writer's Guide for Psychoanalysts and Psychotherapists", "authors": ["Suzi Naiburg"], "publisher": "Routledge", "publishedDate": "2015-04-10", "description": "Structure and Spontaneity in Clinical Prose will teach you to read gifted writers for inspiration and practical lessons in the craft of writing; apply the principles and techniques of the paradigmatic, narrative, lyric narrative, evocative, and enactive modes of clinical prose; and put what you learn immediately into practice in eighty-four writing exercises. Each of the five modes uses different means to construct worlds out of language. The paradigmatic abstracts ideas from experience to build concepts and theories. The narrative mode organizes experience through time, creating meaningful relationships between causes and effects. Lyric narratives present events unfolding in an uncertain present. The evocative mode works by invitation and suggestion, and the enactive mode creates an experience to be lived as well as thought.

Thus, the increased need for information concerning the psychological aspects of end-stage renal disease has been met by occasional journal articles, professional peer discussions, small portions of national confer ences, and informal conversations and consultations with people with clinical and research experience in these areas. The First International Conference on Psychological Factors in Hemodialysis and Transplantation arose out of a need to have a forum in which the major people involved in treatment and research in this area could share their latest work among themselves and with the registrants. The initial encouragement for organizing such a conference came from the rank and file of nephrology social workers, nephrology nurses, and liaison psychiatrists and psychologists. In early 1977 I had decided that I would make an effort to organize such a meeting and asked the two other individuals most closely identified with major research in this area, Atara Kaplan De-Nour and Harry S. Abram, to join me in planning this confer ence. With their support and suggestions concerning the program, I embarked upon an attempt to raise financial backing for it. I was some what surprised to find that the many equipment and drug companies supporting nephrological conferences were not greatly interested in this one.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781489903570"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1489903577"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 287, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.3.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13452, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-o5G4BgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13452000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Psychonephrology_1-sample-epub.acsm?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Psychonephrology_1-sample-pdf.acsm?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=o5G4BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "6PFM0kxYnKEC", "etag": "CcVsWSXJchs", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6PFM0kxYnKEC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Progress in Social Psychiatry in Japan", "subtitle": "An Approach to Psychiatric Epidemiology", "authors": ["Yoshibumi Nakane"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-10-30", "description": "\u200bSocial psychiatry is a multidisciplinary field analyzing mechanisms of mental health issues comprehensively to contribute to society using the findings.

Also this book might be useful for policymakers on formulating mental health policies. Key messages of this book are based on: a) mental illness represent a huge cost for society and for health care; b) health economics applied to mental health could help in the optimization of resource allocation for mental health care and for better decision making in terms of balancing costs and benefits; c) interventions and treatment should be also chosen in general medical practice and in public decision-policy according to cost-effectiveness, burden of disease and equity principles; d) quality of care is related with better outcomes, higher quality of life for clients, and with lower costs for society and health system (best value for money); e) it is possible to decrease the burden of mental disorders with cost-effective treatments. The book is divided in four main topics: 1. Introduction to Health Economics applied to Mental Health \u2013 this section is an overview of basic principles, concepts and methods used in Economics and Health Economics to enable students to make critical appraisal of Health Economics texts and also to design research studies in this topic. 2. Health Economics applied to the evaluation of quality and costs of Mental Health Services \u2013 this section presents results of Brazilian studies on the costs of mental health care (hospital, outpatient care, residential care, informal care), methods on the measurement of costs and it discusses issues related with public policies decisions and quality of mental health car in the low and middle income countries context. There is also an overview of quality indicators of mental health care and instruments to evaluate mental health services and costs.3. Health Economics applied to evaluate treatment of mental disorders - This section presents a review of cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and other interventions applied for treating the most burdensome mental disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, psychosis, alcohol and drug disorders, dementia, and hyper attention deficit disorders. 4. Health Economics, burden and indirect costs of mental disorders - This section highlights the social and economic burden caused by mental illness under societal perspective focusing on stigma, unemployment, indirect costs in the workplace (absenteeism and presenteeism), the relationship between poverty and mental disorders, global health and social determinants of mental health and on the costs of mental disorders (depression, anxiety, psychosis, alcohol and drug disorders).

An Ethnographic Study of Mental Health Treatment and Outcomes: Doing What Works documents the treatment history of three women suffering from affective and personality disorders. The book guides you through the process of conducting qualitative/ethnographic research, providing examples of data collection techniques, analysis, and interpretation. Interviews and observations provide you with a glimpse into the world of mental health treatment from each woman''s perspective and offer suggestions on interventions and group activities designed to improve treatment outcomes. An Ethnographic Study of Mental Health Treatment and Outcomes: Doing What Works is a first-hand look at the reality of mental health treatment, where outcomes are not necessarily related to a patient''s satisfaction with his or her treatment and, in fact, often have little relationship to the kind of treatment the patient has received. The book also includes research evidence on comparisons of the efficacy of individual versus group treatment, the success rate of Alcoholics Anonymous and Overeaters Anonymous, the effectiveness of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and current treatment for anorexia nervosa. An Ethnographic Study of Mental Health Treatment and Outcomes: Doing What Works will help you improve your clinical skills by exploring the treatment experiences of three women: Debora--40, college-educated, married with children; suffering from personality disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders; a survivor of childhood abuse; a survivor of several suicide attempts; chronically self-destructive Belinda--22, overweight, always dressed in black, self-mutilator covered in body piercings and tattoos; professional hairdresser and practicing witch; has attempted suicide; former Alcoholic Anonymous member; cocaine addict Cicely--late 30s, school teacher, divorced but still lives with ex-husband and two children; suffers from anorexia; child of an alcoholic; guarded, controlled, suicidal An Ethnographic Study of Mental Health Treatment and Outcomes: Doing What Works is an intimate look at treatment from the patients'' perspective, offering practical information on techniques and methods for mental health professionals, practitioners, and academics.eived.

Mental disorders represent a public health challenge of staggering proportions. According to the most recent Global Burden of Disease study, psychiatric disorders constitute the leading cause of years lost to disability. The high morbidity and mortality related to these conditions are proportional to the potential for overall health gains if mental disorders can be more effectively diagnosed and treated. In order to fill these gaps, analysis in science, industry, and government seeks to use big data for a variety of problems, including clinical outcomes and diagnosis in psychiatry. Multiple mental healthcare providers and research laboratories are increasingly using large data sets to fulfill their mission. Briefly, big data is characterized by high volume, high velocity, variety and veracity of information, and to be useful it must be analyzed, interpreted, and acted upon. As such, focus has to shift to new analytical tools from the field of machine learning that will be critical for anyone practicing medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences in the 21st century. Big data analytics is gaining traction in psychiatric research, being used to provide predictive models for both clinical practice and public health systems. As compared with traditional statistical methods that provide primarily average group-level results, big data analytics allows predictions and stratification of clinical outcomes at an individual subject level. Personalized Psychiatry \u2013 Big Data Analytics in Mental Health provides a unique opportunity to showcase innovative solutions tackling complex problems in mental health using big data and machine learning. It represents an interesting platform to work with key opinion leaders to document current achievements, introduce new concepts as well as project the future role of big data and machine learning in mental health.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030035532"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030035530"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 180, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=57&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zMOHDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Personalized_Psychiatry-sample-epub.acsm?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Personalized_Psychiatry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zMOHDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "z6wwDwAAQBAJ", "etag": "+sn6tZEzu/0", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/z6wwDwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Making It Crazy", "subtitle": "An Ethnography of Psychiatric Clients in an American Community", "authors": ["Sue E.

As such, this text addresses the status and fate of the family; extreme suffering produced by divorce and the pathologies associated with children who receive inadequate parenting and care; the apparent increased frequency of mental disorders, some of which are products of family life; and, the mental health functions of family life that promotes well-being and provides refuge against despair.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780306463969"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0306463962"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 283, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J_29yJryCMUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J_29yJryCMUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J_29yJryCMUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J_29yJryCMUC&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Family_Functioning.html?hl=&id=J_29yJryCMUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Family_Functioning-sample-pdf.acsm?id=J_29yJryCMUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=J_29yJryCMUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "NHgiBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "qeKmEdM+/po", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NHgiBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Attribution of Blame", "subtitle": "Causality, Responsibility, and Blameworthiness", "authors": ["K.G.

What does it mean to assert that someone is responsible for a moral affront? Under what circumstances should we blame others for wrongdoing? The related, but conceptually distinct, issues of causality, responsibility, and blameworthiness that are the subject of this book play a critical role in our everyday social encounters. As very young children we learn to assert that \"it wasn't my fault,\" or that \"I didn't mean to do it.\" Responsibility and blame follow us into adulthood, as personal or organizational failings require explanation. Although judgments of moral accountability are quickly made and adamantly defended, the process leading to those judgments is not as simple as it might seem. Psychological research on causality and responsibility has not taken complete advantage of a long tradition of philosophical analysis of these concepts. Philosophical discussions, for their part, have not been sufficiently I1ware of the psychological realities. An assignment of blame is a social explanation. It is the outcome of a process that begins with an event having negative consequences, involves judgments about causality, personal responsibility, and possible mitigation. The result can be an assertion, or a denial, of individual blameworthiness. The purpose of this book is to develop a comprehensive theory of how people assign blame.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461250944"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461250943"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 194, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NHgiBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Attribution_of_Blame-sample-epub.acsm?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Attribution_of_Blame-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NHgiBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "a7q8DQAAQBAJ", "etag": "tOFNRU746hE", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/a7q8DQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Psychiatric Care in Severe Obesity", "subtitle": "An Interdisciplinary Guide to Integrated Care", "authors": ["Sanjeev Sockalingam", "Raed Hawa"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2016-12-16", "description": "This book is designed to present a comprehensive, state-of the-art approach to assessing and managing bariatric surgery and psychosocial care.

Psychiatric Care in Severe Obesity takes a 360 approach by covering the disease\u2019s prevalence and relationship to psychiatric illness and social factors, including genetics, neurohormonal pathways and development factors for obesity. This book presents evidence and strategies for assessing psychiatric issues in severe obesity and uses common psychiatric presentations to feature the impact on bariatric surgery and key assessment features for weight loss. Concluding chapters focus on evidence-based psychosocial treatments for supporting patients with weight loss and bariatric surgery and includes educational tools and checklists for assessment, treatment, and care. Experts on non-pharmacological interventions such as mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapy and nutrition education describe treatment approaches in each modality, concluding with pharmacological approaches for psychiatric conditions and eating pathology. Additional tools in the appendices support clinicians, making this the ultimate guide for managing psychiatric illness in patients suffering from severe obesity.

This place is 20 km off Tegel Airport, Berlin's main airport, and has been beautifully restored by baroness Edith von Thiingen (nee von BUlow, i. e. of historical Prussian aristocracy); it lends itself rather perfectly for the IWCN type of small interdisciplinary workshops on neurodegenera tion which combine short lectures with plenty of discussion. In this context, we could quote Alexander von Humboldt's famous opening words for one of the first international scientific meetings held at Berlin, on September 18, 1828: \"The main purpose ... does not consist in a mutual reading of manuscripts all to be printed after at least one year in specialised publications, but in the personal communication amongst those who work in similar scientific fields; the oral and thus more stimulating exchange of ideas, might they represent facts, opinions or doubts; the foundation of friendly relations which convey illumination to our sciences, serene grace to our lives and tolerance and mildness to our habits ...

An alternative explanation, however, is that doctors are just as moral, ethical, and concerned as ever before, but that a vast amount of additional new information has won the competition for attention. The data available to the old-fashioned doctor were a patient's history, physical examination, and \"per sonal profile,\" together with a limited number of generally ineffectual therapeu tic agents. A doctor today deals with an enormous array of additional new information, which comes from X rays, biopsies, cytology, electrographic tracings, and the phantasmagoria of contemporary laboratory tests; and the doctor must also be aware of a list of therapeutic possibilities that are both far more effective and far more extensive than ever before.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781468435276"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1468435272"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 351, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.2.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=81&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7316, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-PRvpBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7316000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Patient-sample-epub.acsm?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Patient-sample-pdf.acsm?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=PRvpBwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "qfsxBwAAQBAJ", "etag": "Q5CBmW/w50U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qfsxBwAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Women\u2019s Sexual Development", "subtitle": "Explorations of Inner Space", "authors": ["Martha Kirkpatrick"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06", "description": "This is not a textbook nor an encyclopedia; rather, it is a collection of papers representing a variety of points of view on contemporary is sues, controversies, and questions about female sexual development. The editor has a point of view, not a point of view as to which of the various authors' positions presented in this book is correct, or even the most useful, but a point of view about the format of such a book; namely, that the definitive answers, and the experts who will provide them, are not yet identified. Therefore, many voices should be heard from different areas of expertise, training, experience, and back ground. Inevitably there are contradictions and disagreements. There should be. Several authors who were asked to provide short discus sions for papers found themselves unable to answer in less than an ad ditional paper. The editor welcomed this response. This is an area full of ancient myths, new discoveries, and alternate perspectives. It is hoped that the book reflects these ambiguities and controversies and that it will stimulate as many questions as it provides answers. You will find represented in this volume, and its forthcoming companion volume on women's sexual experience, authors not gener ally found together between the covers.

Scammell"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2011-07-01", "description": "The field of narcolepsy has developed enormously within the last 10 years. Indeed the understanding of the basics of sleep-wake regulation and the discovery of new neurotransmitter systems (the hypocretins) has boosted research and key findings in the field, providing important insights into how sleep is regulated. Consequently narcolepsy now receives a great deal of attention from both clinicians and scientists throughout the world. Narcolepsy: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment not only offers an engaging and comprehensive treatment of a fascinating disorder but also includes a DVD that offers a unique and large collection of movies displaying the symptoms of narcolepsy in people and animals. Written by some of the best experts in the field, the book focuses on the pathophysiology of the problem and also provides critical, up-to-date insights on the key clinical issues: how to diagnose the disorder, how to treat it, and how to best manage psychosocial problems. The first and only guide to span the latest advances in narcolepsy, this reference provides sections in etiology, neurochemistry, the role of the hypocretins in sleep-wake regulation, animal models in narcolepsy, the key role of the hypothalamus, REM-sleep dysregulation, diagnosis and classification, and treatment. Compiled by an international group of more than 30 authors, Narcolepsy: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment is an indispensable resource for all clinicians and scientists with an interest in narcolepsy.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1441983902"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781441983909"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 428, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yTLkszI1to0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yTLkszI1to0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yTLkszI1to0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=89&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yTLkszI1to0C&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yTLkszI1to0C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 14278, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 14278, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yTLkszI1to0C&rdid=book-yTLkszI1to0C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 14278000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 14278000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Narcolepsy-sample-epub.acsm?id=yTLkszI1to0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Narcolepsy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=yTLkszI1to0C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yTLkszI1to0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "I95L4S7YhmgC", "etag": "usaTuGy61Ow", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/I95L4S7YhmgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Comprehensive Handbook of Cognitive Therapy", "authors": ["Hal Arkowitz", "L.E.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: From Genes to Patients aims to provide a comp- hensive, state-of-the-art overview of the critical aspects of ADHD, and hopefully will serve as a quick and up-to-date reference source for professionals with an int- est in ADHD. The book is divided into three major areas that follow an historical survey. The first group of chapters deals with current theories on the pathophysiology of ADHD, and focuses on neurotransmitters and the contributions and validity of animal m- els. The second section emphasizes the evaluation and treatment of patients with ADHD, from the day-to-day approach by the clinical psychologist to the more sophisticated anatomical and functional imaging strategies that have emerged in the last decade. In addition, chapters dealing with specific impairments, such as those pertaining to reading, social interaction, and working memory, are also included for more detailed analysis of these important aspects and their respective contributions to global functioning. The third and final section provides an expanded review on the pharmacotherapy of ADHD and the appropriate methods for selection of specific drugs for individual patients based on drug kinetics and gene expression.

The goal is to document and interpret these data to justify eliminating the diagnosis of schizophrenia from the nomenclature. The author reviews the changing diagnostic concepts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with a historical perspective to clarify how the current conflict over explanations for psychosis has arisen. That two disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar, known as the Kraepelinian dichotomy, account for the functional psychoses has been a cornerstone of Psychiatry for over 100 years, but is questioned because of substantial similarities and overlap between these two disorders. Literature in the field demonstrates that psychotic patients are frequently misdiagnosed as suffering from the disease called schizophrenia when they suffer from a psychotic mood disorder. Such patients, their families, and their caretakers suffer significant disadvantages from the misdiagnosis. Psychotic patients misdiagnosed with schizophrenia receive substandard care regarding their medications, thus allowing their bipolar conditions to worsen. Other adverse effects are substantial and will be included. Liability for medical malpractice is of critical importance for the mental health professionals who make the majority of the diagnoses of schizophrenia. The concept put forward in this work will have a discipline-altering impact.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781461418696"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1461418690"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 428, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ul1rENlkNYMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ul1rENlkNYMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ul1rENlkNYMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ul1rENlkNYMC&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Schizophrenia_Is_a_Misdiagnosis.html?hl=&id=Ul1rENlkNYMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Ul1rENlkNYMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "oLmdDQAAQBAJ", "etag": "VONjWHreZjM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oLmdDQAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Child and Adolescent Psychiatry", "subtitle": "Asian Perspectives", "authors": ["Savita Malhotra", "Paramala Santosh"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2016-11-25", "description": "This is a comprehensive volume on issues and concerns relating to child and adolescent mental health in Asia, which includes contributions from experts in child psychiatry from Asia and other parts of the world.

The various sections deal with important topics in child and adolescent psychiatry: the current understanding of mental disorders and the ways in which possible influences might work in the development of psychopathology; substance use disorders, their neurobiological correlates and implications for the developing brain; early environmental influences in the psychopathology of psychiatric disorders in children; issues of parenting, child rearing and cultural practices in Asia, which influence personality development and adaptation; life-long impact of early parental loss; early diagnosis and intervention in recognizing and treating psychopathology; psychopharmacology of neurodevelopmental disorders in children; non-pharmacological treatments for children; mental health gap, and telepsychiatry as an innovative model to provide services for children; and a pressing need for a comprehensive child mental health policy across nations.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9788132236191"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "813223619X"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 488, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.3.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-oLmdDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Child_and_Adolescent_Psychiatry-sample-epub.acsm?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Child_and_Adolescent_Psychiatry-sample-pdf.acsm?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oLmdDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "FKeq7eZVceUC", "etag": "2GWrurx+ds8", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FKeq7eZVceUC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Culture and Common Mental Disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa", "authors": ["Vikram Patel"], "publisher": "Psychology Press", "publishedDate": "1998", "description": "The influence of culture on mental illness has been the subject of considerable academic investigation and debate in recent years. This debate has provoked concerns about the validity and reliability of older methodologies which emphasised either universal characteristics of disorders which were heavily biased towards Euro-American systems, or the culturally relativist approach which saw psychological disorders as products largely of their own culture. The \"new\" cross-cultural psychiatry proposed that the integration of ethnographic and epidemiological techniques be required to enable a culture sensitive psychiatric model to emerge. This monograph describes a series of research studies conducted in primary care in Harare, Zimbabwe, focusing on the most frequent of all psychological disorders, Common Mental Disorders (CMD). The four consecutive studies are unique in several respects, most notably, the involvement of both biomedical and traditional health care providers at all stages, the development of an indigenous measure of CMD for use in epidemiological investigations, the examination of the relationship between local and biomedical models of psychological disorder and the sociodemographic and economic risk factors for CMD. The experiences and findings of these studies provide new directions in our understanding of the contribution of culture to the presentation, assessment, classification and risk factors for CMD in primary care in an urban African setting. The methodology used also sets out a model for epidemiological research in other areas of mental health in different cultural settings.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0863775306"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780863775307"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 128, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.5.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FKeq7eZVceUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FKeq7eZVceUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FKeq7eZVceUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FKeq7eZVceUC&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Culture_and_Common_Mental_Disorders_in_S.html?hl=&id=FKeq7eZVceUC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Culture_and_Common_Mental_Disorders_in_S-sample-epub.acsm?id=FKeq7eZVceUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FKeq7eZVceUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WReAE_UZXSIC", "etag": "3tVgAob+PzM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WReAE_UZXSIC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Addiction Recovery Management", "subtitle": "Theory, Research and Practice", "authors": ["John F.

After three decades of extensive research on those non-ordinary states of consciousness induced by psychedelic drugs and by other means, Grof concludes that our present scientific world view is as inadequate as many of its historical predecessors. In this pioneering work, he proposes a new model of the human psyche that takes account of his findings. Grof includes in his model the recollective level, or the reliving of emotionally relevant memories, a level at which the Freudian framework can be useful. Beyond that is perinatal level in which the human unconscious may be activated to a reliving of biological birth and confrontation with death. How birth experience influences an individual's later development is a central focus of the book. The most serious challenge to contemporary psycho-analytic theory comes from a delineation of the transpersonal level, or the expansion of consciousness beyond the boundaries of time and space. Grof makes a bold argument that understanding of the perinatal and transpersonal levels changes much of how we view both mental illness and mental health. His reinterpretation of some of the most agonizing aspects of human behavior proves thought provoking for both laypersons and professional therapists.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0873959531"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780873959537"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 466, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.3.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OX8WGRZQIT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OX8WGRZQIT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OX8WGRZQIT4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=99&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OX8WGRZQIT4C&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Beyond_the_Brain.html?hl=&id=OX8WGRZQIT4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Beyond_the_Brain-sample-epub.acsm?id=OX8WGRZQIT4C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Beyond_the_Brain-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OX8WGRZQIT4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OX8WGRZQIT4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "DTkqBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "fm/Lxv4aSaQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DTkqBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Adolescent Identity Treatment", "subtitle": "An Integrative Approach for Personality Pathology", "authors": ["Pamela A.

While most adolescents build satisfying interpersonal relationships, are successful in school and work and begin romantic relationships, there is a minority of adolescents who do not succeed in this and are at a high risk of developing problems in school, work and relationships, problems with affect regulation as well as engaging in a wide range of self-destructive behaviors.

Though by no means an \"easy read,\" Masson's collection of these nine articles exposes a point in the history of the practice of psychology that proves ignorance and negative attitudes towards women created a dark science that modern psychiatrists struggle to overcome.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781611875782"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1611875781"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 130, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["FAMILY & RELATIONSHIPS"], "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zfZnvVG1MCAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zfZnvVG1MCAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zfZnvVG1MCAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=103&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zfZnvVG1MCAC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zfZnvVG1MCAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 439.64, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 307.75, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zfZnvVG1MCAC&rdid=book-zfZnvVG1MCAC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 439640000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 307750000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=zfZnvVG1MCAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KpB9CAAAQBAJ", "etag": "TquUoc+Ih8c", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KpB9CAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Handbook of Psychiatric Diagnostic Procedures", "authors": ["R.C.W.

It\u2019s only over the last few decades that the field has started to pay attention to what constitutes a functional and content life. Instead of using disease to understand health, positive psychology studies the components of a good life and helps people not only avoid mental health problems but develop happiness. The work done in positive psychology is now at a point where applications are being developed in positive psychotherapy and extended to those with psychiatric diagnoses in positive psychiatry. While these fields are a recent development they hold the promise of helping all of us live a fulfilled life. Medicine in general, and psychiatry in particular, suffers from a worldview that is symptom- and deficit-oriented. By adopting a positive approach, psychology, psychotherapy, and psychiatry add a more holistic, integrative, resource oriented, and preventive perspective. There is great urgency in developing resources and potentials in our patients, not only freeing them from their disorders. Psychiatrists and psychotherapists alike are incorporating these positive tools into their practices with positive clinical outcomes. Standing on the shoulders of pioneers like Nossrat Peseschkian, in positive psychotherapy, and Dilip Jeste, in positive psychiatry, this textbook is the first to bring together these innovations in one volume that will serve as an excellent resource for medical professionals looking to reap the benefits gained by the studies in these areas. Currently, the majority of texts that are available are targeting psychologists and researchers, whereas this book seeks to use positive psychology as the foundation on which the clinical applications are built. As such, this book will be of interest to psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals. It may be used in educating a new generation of mental health professionals in these tenets that are expanding the reach of psychology, the practice of psychotherapy, and the scope of psychiatry.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030332648"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030332640"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 431, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10926.8, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-iSTMDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10926800000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Positive_Psychiatry_Psychotherapy_and_Ps-sample-epub.acsm?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Positive_Psychiatry_Psychotherapy_and_Ps-sample-pdf.acsm?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iSTMDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "CrdIRD57mmQC", "etag": "kcSGM3708iw", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CrdIRD57mmQC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Evaluating Mental Health Disability in the Workplace", "subtitle": "Model, Process, and Analysis", "authors": ["Liza Gold", "Daniel W.

Such illness can have serious consequences -- job loss, lawsuits, workplace violence\u2014yet the effects of mental health issues on job functioning are rarely covered in clinical training. In addition, clinicians are often asked to provide opinions on an employee\u2019s fitness for work or an evaluation for disability benefits, only to find themselves embroiled in complex legal and administrative conflicts. A unique collaboration between a renowned clinical professor of psychiatry and a noted legal expert, Evaluating Mental Health Disability in the Workplace approaches the topic from two distinct areas: the legal context and issues relevant to disability and disability-related evaluations, and the interplay of factors in the relationship between work and psychiatric illness. From this dual perspective, the authors advocate for higher professional standards ensuring that employers, evaluees, or third parties are provided with the most reliable information.

In accordance with the importance that the phenomenological approach attaches to subjectivity and sense of self as the starting points for knowledge, emphasis is placed on the need for the clinician to focus on the subjective experiences of the at-risk individual, to set aside prior assumptions, judgments, or interpretations, and to identify ways of bridging gaps in communication associated with negative emotions. The vital importance of empathy is stressed, drawing attention to the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition. It is widely acknowledged that when a clinician meets a person who wants to die by suicide, the clinician does not fully understand what is going on inside the mind of that individual. This book recognizes that any approach to suicide prevention must promote understanding of suicidal thoughts and feelings.

Neuropsychiatric disorders are organic brain diseases with psychiatric symptoms, as in Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, that cause cognitive impairment, including dementia, amnesic syndrome, and personality\u2013behavioral changes. As a clinical science, neuropsychiatry aims to explore the complex interrelationship between behavior and brain function from a variety of perspectives, including those of psychology, neurology, and psychiatry. This concise and updated monograph comprises the latest findings in the field and includes chapters on delusional symptoms, mood disorders and neurotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, behavioral and personality changes, and recently, cerebral alterations revealed in PTSD patients and in endogenous psychoses through neuroimaging and neuropathology. These findings will certainly widen the realm of neuropsychiatry going forward and will prove of great value to specialists as well as to academics and trainees in neurology, psychiatry, neuropsychology, neuroradiology, neuropathology, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, and clinical genetics. Ultimately, neuropsychiatry aims to prevent and reduce the suffering of individuals with the psychiatric symptoms of cerebral disorders.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "4431538712"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9784431538714"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 351, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.11.11.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=117&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 16874, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&rdid=book-u7ICX2Yh4HoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 16874000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Neuropsychiatric_Disorders-sample-epub.acsm?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Neuropsychiatric_Disorders-sample-pdf.acsm?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=u7ICX2Yh4HoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "eMHE059rE0kC", "etag": "Y7Hx+Fl97AQ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eMHE059rE0kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Self in Neuroscience and Psychiatry", "authors": ["Tilo Kircher", "Anthony David"], "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "publishedDate": "2003-08-07", "description": "This 2003 book focuses on neuropsychiatric models of self-consciousness, set against introductory essays describing the philosophical, historical and psychological approaches.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0521533503"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780521533508"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 484, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Medical"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eMHE059rE0kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eMHE059rE0kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eMHE059rE0kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=118&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eMHE059rE0kC&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Self_in_Neuroscience_and_Psychiatry.html?hl=&id=eMHE059rE0kC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eMHE059rE0kC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "26eoDgAAQBAJ", "etag": "Pk4dek42tEU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/26eoDgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Religious Beliefs, Evolutionary Psychiatry, and Mental Health in America", "subtitle": "Evolutionary Threat Assessment Systems Theory", "authors": ["Kevin J. Flannelly"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2017-05-09", "description": "This book provides a new perspective on the association between religious beliefs and mental health. The book is divided into five parts, the first of which traces the development of theories of organic evolution in the cultural and religious context before Charles Darwin. Part II describes the major evolutionary theories that Darwin proposed in his three books on evolution, and the religious, sociological, and scientific reactions to his theories. Part III introduces the reader to the concept of evolutionary psychiatry. It discusses how different regions of the brain evolved over time, and explains that certain brain regions evolved to protect us from danger by assessing threats of harm in the environment, including other humans. Specifically, this part describes: how psychiatric symptoms that are commonly experienced by normal individuals during their everyday lives are the product of brain mechanisms that evolved to protect us from harm; the prevalence rate of psychiatric symptoms in the U.S. general population; how religious and other beliefs influence the brain mechanisms that underlie psychiatric symptoms; and the brain regions that are involved in different psychiatric disorders. Part IV presents the findings of U.S. studies demonstrating that positive beliefs about God and life-after-death, and belief in meaning-in-life and divine forgiveness have salutary associations with mental health, whereas negative beliefs about God and life-after-death, belief in the Devil and human evil, and doubts about one\u2019s religious beliefs have pernicious associations with mental health. The last part of the book summarizes each section and recommends research on the brain mechanism underlying psychiatric symptoms, and the relationships among these brain mechanisms, religious beliefs, and mental health in the context of ETAS Theory.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319524887"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319524887"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 341, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Psychiatry&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9239.4, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-26eoDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9239400000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Religious_Beliefs_Evolutionary_Psychiatr-sample-epub.acsm?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Religious_Beliefs_Evolutionary_Psychiatr-sample-pdf.acsm?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=26eoDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "KMyoBgAAQBAJ", "etag": "sgkkoVfJV6U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KMyoBgAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Phenomenology, Language & Schizophrenia", "authors": ["Manfred Spitzer", "Friedrich Uehlein", "Michael A.
