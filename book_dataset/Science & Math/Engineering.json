The meeting was conducted by the American Association of Community Colleges through a grant from the National Science Foundation. The goals of the meeting were to: (1) establish general principles to build upon and guide improvements in these study areas; and (2) compose specific recommendations for stakeholders in SMET education. General guidelines were proposed in the following seven areas: (1) Relevance-- MET skills should be taught to all students at the earliest stages of education; (2) Access--there should be equal access for all students to SMET programs; (3) Benchmarks--learning and performance benchmarks should be established in the learning process; (4) Instruction-instructional strategies must be learner-centered; (5) Partnerships-educational institutions and community groups should work together; (6) Funding--new approaches to funding must be developed; and (7) Global Dimensions-the quality of our educational system should be measured against that of other countries. The report also offers recommendations to nine stakeholders in SMET education: community colleges, students, faculty, academic support personnel, academic administrators, presidents, college trustees, four-year postsecondary institutions, and government. Appended are lists of resources and occupational skills standards projects.

Lotfi's algebra of fuzzy subsets of a set struck me as very nice; in fact, as a graduate student in the mid-1950's, I had suggested similar ideas about continuous-truth-valued propositional calculus (inffor \"and\", sup for \"or\") to my advisor, but he didn't go for it (and in fact, confused it with the foundations of probability theory), so I ended up writing a thesis in a more conventional area of mathematics (differential algebra). I especially enjoyed Lotfi's discussion of fuzzy convexity; I remember talking to him about possible ways of extending this work, but I didn't pursue this at the time. I have elsewhere told the story of how, when I saw C. L. Chang's 1968 paper on fuzzy topological spaces, I was impelled to try my hand at fuzzi fying algebra. This led to my 1971 paper \"Fuzzy groups\", which became the starting point of an entire literature on fuzzy algebraic structures. In 1974 King-Sun Fu invited me to speak at a U. S. -Japan seminar on Fuzzy Sets and their Applications, which was to be held that summer in Berkeley.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3790814202"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783790814200"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 314, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Mathematics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kz9qOzUMJOAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kz9qOzUMJOAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kz9qOzUMJOAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kz9qOzUMJOAC&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Fuzzy_Mathematics.html?hl=&id=kz9qOzUMJOAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Fuzzy_Mathematics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=kz9qOzUMJOAC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kz9qOzUMJOAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "gddlyAEACAAJ", "etag": "WHKnfFJITgM", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gddlyAEACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Crisis in American Math, Science, and Engineering Education", "subtitle": "Hearing of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, United States Senate, One Hundred First Congress, First Session, on Examining the Status of American Math, Science, and Engineering, November 14, 1989", "authors": ["United States.

STEM Lesson Essentials provides all the tools and strategies you'll need to design integrated, interdisciplinary STEM lessons and units that are relevant and exciting to your students. With clear definitions of both STEM and STEM literacy, the authors argue that STEM in itself is not a curriculum, but rather a way of organizing and delivering instruction by weaving the four disciplines together in intentional ways. Rather than adding two new subjects to the curriculum, the engineering and technology practices can instead be blended into existing math and science lessons in ways that engage students and help them master 21st century skills. STEM Lesson Essentials shows teachers how to begin the STEM integration journey with: five guiding principles for effective STEM instruction classroom examples of what these principles look like in action sample activities that put all four STEM fields into practice lesson planning templates for STEM units. Explicit connections are made among the STEM practices, including the Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice and the Framework for K-12 Science Education, helping you easily recognize ways in which STEM lessons can engage students in multiple standards at the same time. With ideas that are practical and achievable in any classroom, STEM Lesson Essentials will give you the confidence and knowledge to weave engineering and technology concepts into your math and science curriculum.

In it, we learn how a love for science can start with a love for an object\u2014a microscope, a modem, a mud pie, a pair of dice, a fishing rod. Objects fire imagination and set young people on a path to a career in science. In this collection, distinguished scientists, engineers, and designers as well as twenty-five years of MIT students describe how objects encountered in childhood became part of the fabric of their scientific selves. In two major essays that frame the collection, Turkle tells a story of inspiration and connection through objects that is often neglected in standard science education and in our preoccupation with the virtual. The senior scientists' essays trace the arc of a life: the gears of a toy car introduce the chain of cause and effect to artificial intelligence pioneer Seymour Papert; microscopes disclose the mystery of how things work to MIT President and neuroanatomist Susan Hockfield; architect Moshe Safdie describes how his boyhood fascination with steps, terraces, and the wax hexagons of beehives lead him to a life immersed in the complexities of design. The student essays tell stories that echo these narratives: plastic eggs in an Easter basket reveal the power of centripetal force; experiments with baking illuminate the geology of planets; LEGO bricks model worlds, carefully engineered and colonized. All of these voices\u2014students and mentors\u2014testify to the power of objects to awaken and inform young scientific minds. This is a truth that is simple, intuitive, and easily overlooked.

Given the growing minority population in the country, it is critical that higher education policies, pedagogies, climates, and initiatives are effective in promoting racial and ethnic minority students' educational attainment in STEM. Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) have shown efficacy in facilitating the success of racial and ethnic minority students in STEM and are collectively responsible for producing nearly one-third of the nation's minority STEM graduates. In Fostering Success of Ethnic and Racial Minorities in STEM, well-known contributors share salient institutional characteristics, unique aspects of climate, pedagogy, and programmatic initiatives at MSIs that are instrumental in enhancing the success of racial and ethnic minority students in STEM education. This book provides recommendations on institutional practice, policy, and lessons that any institution can use on their campus to foster better retention and persistence among minority students. Higher Education leaders and administrators interested in encouraging achievement among racial and ethnic minority students in STEM education will find this book a welcomed and timely addition to the discourse on promoting minority student success.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780415899468"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "041589946X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pzMkwKykepgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pzMkwKykepgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pzMkwKykepgC&pg=PA59&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=40&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pzMkwKykepgC&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Fostering_Success_of_Ethnic_and_Racial_M.html?hl=&id=pzMkwKykepgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pzMkwKykepgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "YhPJf_4pu8kC", "etag": "YpDrgriP0Fk", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YhPJf_4pu8kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "The Mathematical Theory of Finite Element Methods", "authors": ["Susanne Brenner", "L.

It is as sumed that the student, before reading this book, has had courses in me chanics (statics, dynamics) and strength of materials (mechanics of mate rials). It is written at a level for undergraduate and beginning graduate engineering students in mechanical, civil, or aerospace engineering. As a background in mathematics, readers are expected to have had courses in ad vanced calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. Our experience in teaching elasticity theory to engineering students leads us to believe that the course must be problem-solving oriented. We believe that formulation and solution of the problems is at the heart of elasticity theory. 1 Of course orientation to problem-solving philosophy does not exclude the need to study fundamentals. By fundamentals we mean both mechanical concepts such as stress, deformation and strain, compatibility conditions, constitu tive relations, energy of deformation, and mathematical methods, such as partial differential equations, complex variable and variational methods, and numerical techniques. We are aware of many excellent books on elasticity, some of which are listed in the References.

In the coordinate free and metric independent geometric formulation of continuum mechanics as well as for beam theories, the principle of virtual work serves as the fundamental principle of mechanics. Based on the perception of analytical mechanics that forces of a mechanical system are defined as dual quantities to the kinematical description, the virtual work approach is a systematic way to treat arbitrary mechanical systems. Whereas this methodology is very convenient to formulate induced beam theories, it is essential in geometric continuum mechanics when the assumptions on the physical space are relaxed and the space is modeled as a smooth manifold.

Matthews"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2000-01-14", "description": "Vector calculus is the fundamental language of mathematical physics. It pro vides a way to describe physical quantities in three-dimensional space and the way in which these quantities vary. Many topics in the physical sciences can be analysed mathematically using the techniques of vector calculus. These top ics include fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electromagnetism, all of which involve a description of vector and scalar quantities in three dimensions. This book assumes no previous knowledge of vectors. However, it is assumed that the reader has a knowledge of basic calculus, including differentiation, integration and partial differentiation. Some knowledge of linear algebra is also required, particularly the concepts of matrices and determinants. The book is designed to be self-contained, so that it is suitable for a pro gramme of individual study. Each of the eight chapters introduces a new topic, and to facilitate understanding of the material, frequent reference is made to physical applications.

Roughly speaking the essence of the realization problem can be stated as follows: Find the matrices of the state space equations of linear systems for given their transfer matrices. This first book on this topic shows how many well-known classical approaches have been extended to the new classes of positive and fractional linear systems. The modified Gilbert method for multi-input multi-output linear systems, the method for determination of realizations in the controller canonical forms and in observer canonical forms are presented. The realization problem for linear systems described by differential operators, the realization problem in the Weierstrass canonical forms and of the descriptor linear systems for given Markov parameters are addressed. The book also presents a method for the determination of minimal realizations of descriptor linear systems and an extension for cone linear systems. This monographs summarizes recent original investigations of the authors in the new field of the positive and fractional linear systems.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783319048345"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3319048341"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 590, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA576&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 14160, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 14160, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Riq_BAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 14160000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 14160000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/The_Realization_Problem_for_Positive_and-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Riq_BAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "LQRiABuz-qgC", "etag": "K1cawC+N0ms", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LQRiABuz-qgC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering XVI", "authors": ["Olof Widlund", "David E.

Because many engineers do not receive education and training that support the kinds of critical thinking, reflective decision-making, and effective action necessary to achieve social change, engineers concerned with social justice can feel powerless and isolated as they remain complicit. Utilizing techniques from radical pedagogies of liberation and other movements for social justice, this book presents a roadmap for engineers to become empowered and engage one another in a process of learning and action for social justice and peace.Table of contents: What Do we Mean by Social Justice? / Mindsets in Engineering / Engineering and Social Injustice / Toward a More Socially Just Engineering / Turning Knowledge into Action: Strategies for Change / Parting Lessons for the Continuing Struggle", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781598296266"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1598296264"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 151, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.0.4.0.preview.3", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7B9heYIbIosC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7B9heYIbIosC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7B9heYIbIosC&pg=PA33&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7B9heYIbIosC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7B9heYIbIosC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2596, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2596, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7B9heYIbIosC&rdid=book-7B9heYIbIosC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2596000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2596000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Engineering_and_Social_Justice-sample-epub.acsm?id=7B9heYIbIosC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Engineering_and_Social_Justice-sample-pdf.acsm?id=7B9heYIbIosC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7B9heYIbIosC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "83ruAAAAMAAJ", "etag": "WZUTAG5+WCU", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/83ruAAAAMAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Talking About Leaving", "subtitle": "Why Undergraduates Leave The Sciences", "authors": ["Elaine Seymour", "Nancy M Hewitt"], "publisher": "Westview Press", "publishedDate": "1997", "description": "This book grew out of a three-year, seven-campus study aimed at explaining the national loss of 40 to 60 percent of undergraduates from science, mathematics, and engineering majors into nonscience disciplines.

Repeating of four seasons in a year accompanied by appropriate changes in nature, alternation of day and night within twenty four hours, heart pulsations, air vibra tions that produce sound or stock-market fluctuations are only several examples. Furthermore, since most of these problems express nonlinear effects characterized by fast and short changes, small waves or wavelets are an ideal modeling tool. An oscillatory property and multiresolution nature of wavelets recommends them for use both in signal processing and in solving complex mathematical models of real world phenomena. As a professor at the School of Mathematics, who teaches computer science students, I feel the need to bridge' the gap between the theoretical and practical aspects of wavelets. On the one side, mathematicians need help to implement wavelet theory in solving practical problems. On the other side, engineers and other practitioners need help in understanding how wavelets work in order to be able to create new or modify the existing wavelets according to their needs. This book tries to satisfy both wavelet user groups; to present and explain the mathematical bases of the wavelet theory and to link them with some of the a~eas where this theory is already being successfully applied. It is self contained and no previous knowledge is assumed.

Beginning with a critique of conventional modeling approaches predicated on Cantor set theoretical assumptions, the authors outline the potential benefits of a fuzzy approach to the study of ambiguous or uncertain preference profiles. While crisp models assume that ambiguity is a form of confusion emerging from imperfect information about policy options, the authors argue instead that some level of ambiguity is innate in human preferences and social interaction. What fuzzy mathematics offers the researcher, then, is a precise tool with which he can model the inherently imprecise dimensions of nuanced empirical reality. Moving beyond the limited treatment fuzzy methodologies have received in extant political science literature, this book develops single- and multidimensional models of fuzzy preference landscapes and characterizes the surprisingly high levels of stability that emerge from interactions between players operating within these models. The material presented makes it a good text for a graduate seminar in formal modeling. It is also suitable as an introductory text in fuzzy mathematics for graduate and advanced undergraduate students.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783540774600"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3540774602"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 214, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KFncY4Zu6pYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KFncY4Zu6pYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KFncY4Zu6pYC&pg=PA1&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KFncY4Zu6pYC&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Applying_Fuzzy_Mathematics_to_Formal_Mod.html?hl=&id=KFncY4Zu6pYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Applying_Fuzzy_Mathematics_to_Formal_Mod-sample-pdf.acsm?id=KFncY4Zu6pYC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KFncY4Zu6pYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "14qHoQgqRKoC", "etag": "SOPlJWESd6A", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/14qHoQgqRKoC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Mathematical Models of Granular Matter", "authors": ["Gianfranco Capriz", "Pasquale Giovine", "Paolo Maria Mariano"], "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media", "publishedDate": "2008-04-18", "description": "Granular matter displays a variety of peculiarities that distinguish it from other appearances studied in condensed matter physics and renders its overall mathematical modelling somewhat arduous.

It focuses on high degree-of-freedom systems and the transitional regimes between regular and chaotic motion. The role of nonlinear normal modes is highlighted and the importance of low-dimensional tori in the resolution of the famous FPU paradox is emphasized. Novel powerful numerical methods are used to study localization phenomena and distinguish order from strongly and weakly chaotic regimes. The emerging hierarchy of complex structures in such regimes gives rise to particularly long-lived patterns and phenomena called quasi-stationary states, which are explored in particular in the concrete setting of one-dimensional Hamiltonian lattices and physical applications in condensed matter systems.

These workshops were sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Re search through the Center for Optimal Design and Control (CODAC) at Vrrginia Tech. The meetings provided a forum for the exchange of new ideas and were designed to bring together diverse viewpoints and to highlight new applications. The primary goal of the workshops was to assess the current status of research and to analyze future directions in optimization based design and control. The present volume contains the technical papers presented at the Second Workshop. More than 65 participants from 6 countries attended the meeting and contributed to its success. It has long been recognized that many modern optimal design problems are best viewed as variational and optimal control problems. Indeed, the famous problem of determining the body of revolution that produces a minimum drag nose shape in hypersonic How was first proposed by Newton in 1686. Optimal control approaches to design can provide theoretical and computational insight into these problems.

Many contributions concern optimization of infini- dimensional systems, ranging from a general overview of the variational analysis, through optimization and sensitivity analysis of PDE systems, to optimal control of neutral systems. A significant group of papers is devoted to shape analysis and opti- zation. Sufficient optimality conditions for ODE problems, and stochastic control methods applied to mathematical finance, are also investigated.

Nearly hundred scientists and engineers from thirteen countries gathered in Warnemiinde to participate in the conference. Rostock Univer sity, the oldest university in Northern Europe founded in 1419, hosted the conference. This workshop followed two earlier workshops held 1997 at the Darmstadt University of Technology and 1998 at Weierstrass Institute for Applied Anal ysis and Stochastics in Berlin under the auspices ofthe German Mathematical Society. These workshops aimed at bringing together two scientific communi ties: applied mathematicians and electrical engineers who do research in the field of scientific computing in electrical engineering. This, of course, is a wide field, which is why it was decided to concentrate on selected major topics. The workshop in Darmstadt, which was organized by Michael Giinther from the Mathematics Department and Ursula van Rienen from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology,brought together more than hundred scientists interested in numerical methods for the simulation of circuits and electromagnetic fields. This was a great success. Voices coming from the participants suggested that it was time to bring these communities together in order to get to know each other, to discuss mutual interests and to start cooperative work.

Predicted by Rayleigh in 1885, surface waves represent waves localized in the vicinity ofextendedboundaries(surfaces)of?uidsorelasticmedia. Intheidealcase of an isotropic elastic half-space while the Rayleigh waves propagate along the surface, the wave amplitude (displacement) in the transverse direction exponentially decays with increasing distance away from the surface. As a resulttheenergyofsurfaceperturbationsislocalizedbytheRayleighwaves within a relatively narrow layer beneath the surface. It is this property of the surface waves that leads to the resonance phenomena that accompany the motion of the perturbation sources (like surface loads) with velocities close to the Rayleigh one; (see e. g. , R. V. Goldstein. Rayleigh waves and resonance phenomena in elastic bodies. Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (PMM), 1965, v. 29, N 3, pp. 608-619). It is essential to note that resonance phenomena are also inherent to the elastic medium in the case where initially there are no free (unloaded) surfaces. However, they occur as a result of an external action accompanied by the violation of the continuity of certain physical quantities, e. g. , by crack nucleation and dynamic propagation. Note that the aforementioned resonance phenomena are related to the nature of the surface waves as homogeneous solutions (eigenfunctions) of the dynamic elasticity equations for a half-space (i. e. nonzero solutions at vanishing boundary conditions).", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781402023873"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1402023871"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 321, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC&pg=PA318&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=96&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 10089, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC&rdid=book-VwxPJ51o9iwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 10089000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Surface_Waves_in_Anisotropic_and_Laminat-sample-pdf.acsm?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VwxPJ51o9iwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "hI_XRgAACAAJ", "etag": "LNtCzn+itC4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hI_XRgAACAAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Engineering Science Experiments", "authors": ["Aviva Ebner"], "publisher": "Chelsea House Pub", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "Explores the different fields of engineering through experiments that allow students to build, explore, test, question, and design.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1604138521"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781604138528"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 147, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Nonfiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hI_XRgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hI_XRgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hI_XRgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hI_XRgAACAAJ&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Engineering_Science_Experiments.html?hl=&id=hI_XRgAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=hI_XRgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "TvZWg83X3-AC", "etag": "hnhctErOQs4", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/TvZWg83X3-AC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Introduction to Discrete Event Simulation and Agent-based Modeling", "subtitle": "Voting Systems, Health Care, Military, and Manufacturing", "authors": ["Theodore T.

linguistics, sociology, and management. The decision-making process in social contexts is based on the analysis of sound alternatives using evaluative criteria. Therefore, this process is one that can be rational or irrational, and can be based on knowledge and/or beliefs. A decision-making process always produces a final decision, which may or may not imply prompt action, and increases the chances of choosing the best possible alternative. The book is divided into four main parts. The concepts covered in the first part, on computer science, explore how the rise of algorithms and the growth in computing power over the years can influence decision-making processes. In the second part, some traditional and innovative ideas and methods used in education are presented: compulsory schooling, inclusive schools, higher education, etc. In turn, the third part focuses on linguistics aspects, and examines how progress is manifested in language. The fourth part, on sociology, explores how society can be influenced by social norms, human interactions, culture, and religion. Management, regarded as a science of the decision-making process, is explored in the last part of this book. Selected organizations\u2019 strategies, objectives and resources are presented, e.g., human resources, financial resources, and technological resources. The book gathers and presents, in a concise format, a broad range of aspects regarding the decision-making process in social contexts, making it a valuable and unique resource for the scientific community.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783030306595"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3030306593"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "pageCount": 543, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 12626, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-w_bADwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 12626000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Decision_Making_in_Social_Sciences_Betwe-sample-epub.acsm?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Decision_Making_in_Social_Sciences_Betwe-sample-pdf.acsm?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=w_bADwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "lAe6iiZBQfsC", "etag": "NbEsmip/4/U", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lAe6iiZBQfsC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Numerical Linear Algebra in Signals, Systems and Control", "authors": ["Paul Van Dooren", "Shankar P.

This textbook gives an overview of the spectrum of modeling techniques, deterministic and stochastic methods, and first-principle and empirical solutions. Complete range: The text continuously covers the complete range of basic modeling techniques: it provides a consistent transition from simple algebraic analysis methods to simulation methods used for research. Such an overview of the spectrum of modeling techniques is very helpful for the understanding of how a research problem considered can be appropriately addressed. Complete methods: Real-world processes always involve uncertainty, and the consideration of randomness is often relevant. Many students know deterministic methods, but they do hardly have access to stochastic methods, which are described in advanced textbooks on probability theory. The book develops consistently both deterministic and stochastic methods. In particular, it shows how deterministic methods are generalized by stochastic methods. Complete solutions: A variety of empirical approximations is often available for the modeling of processes. The question of which assumption is valid under certain conditions is clearly relevant. The book provides a bridge between empirical modeling and first-principle methods: it explains how the principles of modeling can be used to explain the validity of empirical assumptions. The basic features of micro-scale and macro-scale modeling are discussed \u2013 which is an important problem of current research.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642203116"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642203114"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 460, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Computers"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.6.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QD754Y3C5uIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QD754Y3C5uIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QD754Y3C5uIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=112&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QD754Y3C5uIC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QD754Y3C5uIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 4625.6, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QD754Y3C5uIC&rdid=book-QD754Y3C5uIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 4625600000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Mathematical_Modeling-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QD754Y3C5uIC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QD754Y3C5uIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "WAhPBAAAQBAJ", "etag": "dIZpShYPSDo", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/WAhPBAAAQBAJ", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Mathematical Methods in Engineering", "authors": ["Nuno Miguel Fonseca Ferreira", "Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Tenreiro Machado"], "publisher": "Springer", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18", "description": "This book presents a careful selection of the contributions presented at the Mathematical Methods in Engineering (MME10) International Symposium, held at the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra- Engineering Institute of Coimbra (IPC/ISEC), Portugal, October 21-24, 2010.

Since then, the DARS symposia have been held every two years: in 1994 and 1996 in Japan (Riken, Wako), in 1998 in Germany (Karlsruhe), in 2000 in the USA (Knoxville, TN), in 2002 in Japan (Fukuoka), in 2004 in France (Toulouse), and in 2006 in the USA (Minneapolis, MN). The 9th DARS symposium, which was held during November 17\u201319 in T- kuba, Japan, hosted 84 participants from 13 countries. The 48 papers presented there were selected through rigorous peer review with a 50% acceptance ratio. Along with three invited talks, they addressed the spreading research fields of DARS, which are classifiable along two streams: theoretical and standard studies of DARS, and interdisciplinary studies using DARS concepts. The former stream includes multi-robot cooperation (task assignment methodology among multiple robots, multi-robot localization, etc.), swarm intelligence, and modular robots. The latter includes distributed sensing, mobiligence, ambient intelligence, and mul- agent systems interaction with human beings. This book not only offers readers the latest research results related to DARS from theoretical studies to application-oriented ones; it also describes the present trends of this field. With the diversity and depth revealed herein, we expect that DARS technologies will flourish soon.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9783642006449"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "3642006442"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 587, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_AB55N2EdlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_AB55N2EdlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_AB55N2EdlYC&pg=PA193&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=119&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_AB55N2EdlYC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_AB55N2EdlYC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 22066, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_AB55N2EdlYC&rdid=book-_AB55N2EdlYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 22066000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Distributed_Autonomous_Robotic_Systems_8-sample-pdf.acsm?id=_AB55N2EdlYC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_AB55N2EdlYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}, {"kind": "books#volume", "id": "Vfx7wkJgh8kC", "etag": "pB9OtvMZ/js", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Vfx7wkJgh8kC", "volumeInfo": {"title": "Merging Languages and Engineering", "subtitle": "Partnering Across the Disciplines", "authors": ["John M.

They furthermore spend an entire year abroad, one semester as exchange students at a partner university and six months as professional engineering interns at a cooperating company. With a close-to 100% placement rate, over 400 graduates, and numerous national awards, the URI International Engineering Program (IEP) is a proven path of preparation for young engineers in today's global workplace. The author of this volume, John Grandin, is an emeritus professor of German who developed and led the IEP for twenty-three years. In these pages, he provides a two- pronged approach to explain the origin and history of this program rooted in such an unusual merger of two traditionally distinct higher education disciplines. He looks first at himself to explain how and why he became an international educator and what led him to his lasting passion for the IEP. He then provides an historical overview of the program's origin and growth, including looks at the bumps and bruises and ups and downs along the way. Grandin hopes that this story will be of use and value to other educators determined to reform higher education and align it with the needs of the 21st Century.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781627051330"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1627051333"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 90, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC&pg=PA21&dq=subject:Engineering+science+math&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "IN", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 2596, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 2596, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC&rdid=book-Vfx7wkJgh8kC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2596000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 2596000000, "currencyCode": "INR"}}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "IN", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Merging_Languages_and_Engineering-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Vfx7wkJgh8kC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}}]
